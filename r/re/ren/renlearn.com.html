      <p>Advantage Learning Systems, Inc. (“ALSI”) doing business as Renaissance Learning Inc. (“RLI”) considers the privacy and
      security of visitors to our web site to be of paramount importance. We
      have developed this privacy policy to communicate our commitment that we
      will keep any information we obtain private and secure . RLI is the sole
      owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share,
      or rent this information to others in any manner other than that which is
      disclosed in this policy. Please note that RLI does collect certain
      information from our users at several different points on our website. If
      you have any questions about this privacy policy, or other parts to our
      web site, we can be reached via e-mail at <a href="email.htm">answers@renlearn.com</a>,
      or you can call us toll-free at (888) 656-2931. Changes to this privacy
      policy will be posted at this location and e-mailed to anyone who has
      provided us with personally identifiable information as set forth below.</p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b>Personal Information<br>
      </b>As noted above, certain areas of our web site may collect personally
      identifiable information (“PII”). The information collected usually
      consists of an individual’s name, address, telephone number, email
      address, and school or district information. This information is required
      only when an individual wishes to pursue a business relationship with RLI
      such as receiving product information, or purchasing products from our
      online store. This information is collected, and stored in a secure,
      password-protected database that RLI keeps separate from its corporate
      web site. RLI will not disclose this personal information to any
      unrelated third party except when a third party is helping us pursue the
      business relationship initiated by the individual when the individual
      provided the personal information. PII does not include information that
      is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual
      user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual
      (See "Non Personal Information" below).</p>
      <p>If your PII changes, you may correct that information by sending an
      e-mail message to <a href="email.htm">answers@renlearn.com</a> and putting
      the word “UPDATE” in the subject line of the message.</p>
      <p>In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we
      make no effort to secure personal information from children 13 years of
      age or younger. If we become aware that a child 13 years or younger age
      has submitted personal information, we will immediately delete that
      information and not disclose it to any third party, nor will we attempt to
      use it to further pursue a business relationship.</p>
      <p><b>Communication<br>
      </b>From time-to-time RLI sends out promotional and informational
      communications relying on the personal identifiable information it has
      collected. You will have the option of indicating your desire to receive
      or not receive this type of communication at the time of your provision of
      such information to RLI.</p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b>Non Personal Information<br>
      </b>Current technology allows for tracking of other information
      originating from a user’s computer, Internet Service Provider, or
      another originating network component. This information includes a user’s
      IP address and domain information, as well as ‘cookie’ information.</p>
      <p>With regard to IP address and domain information, RLI uses a
      specialized computer system to record this data when a user visits our
      site. This information is only used to provide aggregate statistical
      information to help us keep the site functional and responsive, and to
      determine overall visitor usage patterns. This information is not utilized
      to try and identify specific individuals, or track an individual’s
      navigation through the site.</p>
      <p>Our web site does use "cookie" information to help provide an
      enhanced functional system experience to those visiting the site. A cookie
      is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing
      information about the user. While our site does use cookie information,
      only specific cookie data elements helpful for our site operation are
      accessed and utilized. We may use cookie information to determine ways in
      which our web site can be improved, but no personal identification
      information is included in such activities, and this information is not
      shared with any third party. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may
      still use the site.</p>
      <p><b>External Links to Other Web Sites<br>
      </b>Users visiting our web site may find links to web sites owned and
      operated by other organizations. Please note that when you click on one of
      these links, you are moving to another web site. While we reviewed the
      linked sites at the time of the posting of the link, and only provide a
      link if we believe the content of a site might be of interest to visitors
      to our site, the content of those linked sites is the responsibility of
      the organization actually owning and/or operating the site. RLI is not
      responsible for the content of any linked sight. We encourage you to read
      the privacy statements of any linked site as its privacy policy may differ
      from RLI’s.</p>
