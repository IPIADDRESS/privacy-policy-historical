									<p>Renée Rouleau, Inc. knows that every visitor to our website is concerned about 
										maintaining privacy. Therefore, it is our goal to make each visitor feel secure 
										about accessing and using our website. Set forth below is an explanation of 
										what information Renée Rouleau, Inc. collects through the services available on 
										our web site, reneerouleau.com (the “Site”), how we use that information, how 
										you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect and a description 
										of the policies we have adopted to help meet your privacy concerns.
									</p>
									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">What information is collected and how we use it 
											aggregate information.</font>
										<br>
										First, we collect aggregate information about how many users visit our website 
										and what pages they visit. This information is not personally identifiable. We 
										may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit 
										points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, 
										page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. We use the 
										anonymous browsing information collected automatically by our servers to help 
										administer and improve our Site. In addition, when users request pages on our 
										Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a 
										number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing 
										the Web. We use this information to evaluate the general interests and 
										preferences of our website visitors. We may collect, compile, store, publish, 
										promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate 
										Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. 
										When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any 
										particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any 
										Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other 
										Personal Information under this policy.
									</p>
									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">Personal information. </font>
										<br>
										This is information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, demographic 
										information, hobbies and activities, product preferences, and the like, which 
										you voluntarily submit to us. Customer Service. ReneeRouleau.com uses this 
										information to respond to specific inquiries and requests that you make to our 
										Customer Service Department, provide you with service and support, and maintain 
										the security and integrity of our systems. If you are agreeable, we may use 
										this information to send you product samples, sale coupons, product literature 
										or new product information. Accounts and Transactions. We also collect and 
										store access information related to your account including guest name and user 
										password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing 
										information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card 
										information. We use this information to open, maintain, administer and service 
										your account or membership, as well as process, service or enforce transactions 
										you make through our Site. Statistical Use. We may use information about you 
										for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to 
										estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand 
										demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our guests 
										and customers. Surveys. From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The 
										surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas 
										of interest, and familiarity with Renée Rouleau, Inc. channels, products and 
										services) and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely 
										voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to 
										disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the 
										overall experience on reneerouleau.com. Transaction Processing. We may use your 
										Personal Information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process 
										that includes an online "shopping tote" that allows you to track selected 
										products and proceed through purchase. Also we may share transactional 
										information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or 
										other purchasing or delivery systems. Business sale. Finally, as Renee 
										Rouleau’s business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such 
										transactions customer information may be one of the transferred business 
										assets. If Renée Rouleau, Inc., its Internet businesses, or substantially all 
										of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets 
										transferred. Third Party Involvement. We may outsource all of these tasks to 
										third parties on a confidential basis. Additionally, any information you have 
										given us about your demographics and personal and product preferences may be 
										aggregated with other information to help us analyze how to better develop, 
										market, and promote our products.
									</p>
									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">Reminder.</font>
										<br>
										Reneerouleau.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about 
										you unless you provide it. Therefore, if you do not want reneerouleau.com to 
										obtain any personally identifiable information about you, do not submit it.
									</p>
									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">Disclosure of personal information.</font>
										<br>
										Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not sell or disclose information that 
										identifies our guests personally or makes it possible for other parties to 
										contact them directly without our guests' consent unless we are required to do 
										so by law or as disclosed to you when we request the information from you. 
										Legal Requirement. We may disclose personal information for the following 
										purposes: (1) to conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal 
										process served on Renee Rouleau (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court 
										order); (2) to enforce or apply our policies or agreements (including to 
										initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us); (3) to protect and 
										defend our or our user's rights or property, the Site, our employees, guests or 
										the public, including fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our Site; or (4) 
										if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death 
										or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications 
										or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
									</p>
									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">Cookies.</font>
										<br>
										We may make use of "cookies" on our Site. Cookies are small text files that are 
										stored on a user's computer by a Web server based on the permissions set in a 
										user's browser software. A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read 
										any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie); 
										rather, it is an identifier used by the Web site that originally placed it on 
										your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved 
										by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, 
										monitor, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host 
										server. Therefore, cookies only identify the user's computer to the Web site, 
										which may correlate other information, including personally identifying 
										information, with the cookie. We use cookies to allow us to automate access and 
										data entry functions of our Site such as to correlate online ordering 
										information for purchases you may make while at the Site (if any), tailor the 
										Site to your preferences or interests, or customize promotions or marketing. In 
										addition, cookies allow us to track use of the Site to determine those areas 
										which are useful or popular and those that are not, thereby enabling us to 
										improve and update the Site effectively. The advertisers and/or other content 
										providers that may appear on this website may also use cookies that are not 
										sent by the Renee Rouleau website. Such ads or content may contain cookies that 
										help track and target the interests of users of this website in order to 
										present "personalized" advertisements or other messages that the user might 
										find interesting. Renée Rouleau, Inc. is not responsible for any such cookies. 
										You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or 
										refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can 
										click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and 
										the Security tab. If you click on the "Custom" button, you will be able to see 
										the cookie options. For Netscape users, in the browser, select File, 
										Preferences and then Advanced to view the cookie options. Be aware that if you 
										elect not to accept cookies, the Site may not function properly or permit 
										access.

									<p><font class="SubSectionHeader">Links to other websites.</font>
										<br>
										Our Site may at some pages offer links to other websites. Please note that 
										Renée Rouleau, Inc. has no control over the content or privacy practices of 
										those other websites, and this privacy policy of Renée Rouleau, Inc. does not 
										apply to those sites. We would suggest that you review carefully the posted 
										privacy practices of any of these other websites that you visit.

										We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain Personal 
										Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alternation or destruction by any
