<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Rent the Runway, Inc. knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.  This notice describes our privacy policy for the www.renttherunway.com web site (the “Website”).
<br><br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact us at legalinfo@renttherunway.com, (212) 462-2342, 163 Varick Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10013. This privacy policy covers only information that is collected by and through the Website and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site or other means.</p>

<h4>Notice of Information We Collect And How We Use It</h4>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
<br><br>
In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. </p>

<h4>Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors</h4>
<p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.</p>
<h5>Log Files</h5>
<p>Like many Web sites, we automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files.  This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to make inventory purchasing decisions that will best serve our customer base. </p>

<p>We typically do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.  When IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information it is to offer customers the best user experience possible. We use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate.  This service captures usage and volume statistics.  </p>

<h5>Cookies</h5>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on this site.  As noted above, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br>

We use both session ID and persistent cookies.<br><br>

A session cookie expires when you close you browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.<br><br>

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.<br><br>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.<br><br>

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”</p>

<h5>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h5>

<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. <br><br>

 We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>



<h4>Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests</h4>

<h5>Registration</h5>

We use this information to contact you about the products and services on our Website in which you have expressed interest.  </p>

<h5>Orders</h5>

<p>If you order a product from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).  <br><br>

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.<br><br>

We collect information about your commercial behavior. </p>

<h5>Application Forms for Financial Products or Services</h5>

<p>If you order a product on our Website, then we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, and credit card number.  This information is necessary to process your order and to contact you. </p>

<h5>Surveys or Contests</h5>

<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information.<br><br>

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic, or to personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys) and to send participants an email newsletter.<br><br>

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company may not be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. </p>

<h5>Tell-A-Friend</h5>

<p> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Rent the Runway stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.<br><br>

Your friend may contact us at remove@renttherunway.com to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h5>Chat Rooms/ Discussion Boards</h5>

<p> If you choose to post messages in our chat rooms or other public message areas or leave feedback for other users, we will collect the information you post. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.<br><br>

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.  We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner that is inconsistent with the terms of use <a href="termsnconditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.<br><br>

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.”</p>

<h5>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h5>

<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.<br><br>

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”</p>

<h4>Communication from Us or the Website</h4>

<h5>Special Offers and Updates</h5>

<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions.

<h5>Service-Related Announcements</h5>

<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>



<h5>Customer Service</h5>



<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.  We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, to manage your account, and to provide the best customer service possible. </p>


<h5>Profile </h5>


<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, to create a “profile” of your preferences.  We may tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. <br><br>We do not share your profile with other third parties. </p>

<h5>Address Verification</h5>

Enhancement of Profile Information</p>

This information does not identify individual users. “Partners” are parties with which Rent the Runway has agreed to share or exchange information and may include designers, other websites, or companies with whom Rent the Runway feels its user base would benefit from having a special relationship.  From time to time, partners may be provided with information indicating the demographic information of users on our site, buying behavior, and opportunities to market to select segments of our customer base indirectly.<br><br>

We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>

<h5>Service Providers</h5>



<p>We use other third parties to provide shipping and delivery, marketing, public relations, live chat and web services on the Website.  When you sign up for certain services, we will share name and shipping address information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. </p>

<h5>Legal Disclaimer</h5>


<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us or the Website; or in connection with an actual or proposed corporate transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or part of the business or asset to which the information pertains.</p>



<h5>Co-branded sites</h5>

<p> In the event that that our site links to other sites that include our branding, Rent the Runway’s privacy policy does not apply to those other sites and users are advised to carefully read the policies on those individual sites. </p>


<h4>Co-Marketing</h4>

<p>We may co-market our Products or products of one of our designers or partners by sending you e-mails, where you have previously evidenced interest in the products of that designer or partner.  For instance, we may send an e-mail to all customers who have previously rented a dress from Designer X, advertising the launch of their new product line or the availability of a new product, designed by Designer X, on our Website.  We do not provide your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information to those designers or partners. </p>



<h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). <br><br>

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. <br><br>

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at <a href="mailto:legalinfo@renttherunway.com"><u>legalinfo@renttherunway.com</u></a>.</p>


<h4>Changes in this Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes to this privacy policy and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it <br><br>

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make changes that materially affect our uses or disclosures of personally identifiable information that we have previously collected, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
