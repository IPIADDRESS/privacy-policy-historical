	<h1>Renesys Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Last updated May 7, 2013</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy relates to information collected by or on behalf of Renesys Corporation (“Renesys” or “we” or “us” or “our”) through your use of any Renesys applications and online services, any Renesys websites, and any client software associated with either of the foregoing (collectively such services, websites and software are referred to as “Renesys Services”).</p>
<p>You should carefully read this Privacy Policy. By using any Renesys Services, you are signifying your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you are not permitted to use any Renesys Services.</p>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information.</p>
<p><b>This Privacy Policy serves to notify you of the following:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 1">What information about me is collected?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 2">Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 3">What does Renesys do with the information it collects?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 4">When does Renesys disclose information to third parties?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 5">Does this Privacy Policy apply when I link to other web sites or services?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 6">Is the information collected through Renesys Services secure?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 7">Could my information be transferred to other countries?</a></li>
<li><a href="/privacy/#section 8">What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?</a></li>

</ol>
<p><a name="section 1"></a></p>
<h3>1. WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED?</h3>
<p>Depending on your use of Renesys Services, we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, and billing information.</p>
<p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information is information that any single of item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession, gender, current location, zip code, birth date, or year of birth), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of Renesys Services. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it is combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your viewing preferences).<br>
<a name="section 2"></a></p>
<h3>2. WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?</h3>
<p>We will collect personally identifiable information from you only if you voluntarily submit the information to us. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing payment authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of Renesys Services. <b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Registering to Use Renesys Services and in the Course of Using Renesys Services.</i></b></p>
<p>You may be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of Renesys Services. If so, if you wish to establish an account you may be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information) such as name, postal address, email address, birth date and billing information. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing payment authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process. In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments. Also, we will have access to any personally identifiable information that you choose to share through Renesys Services.</p>
<p><b><i>Cookies and Action Tags.</i></b></p>
<p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using “cookies” and “action tags.”</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on Renesys Services and other websites. Some cookies are necessary for use of Renesys Services (such as cookies that keep you logged in to Renesys Services). Other cookies are used to personalize your experience on Renesys Services (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using Renesys Services (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use Renesys Services), and to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using Renesys Services to help us improve our offerings.</p>
<p>“Action tags,” also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of Renesys Services, including email sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.</p>
<p>By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve Renesys Services and measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Finally, you should be aware that third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you link to their websites or services from Renesys Services. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or services.</p>
<p><b><i>Log Files.</i></b></p>
<p>We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of Renesys Services. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer Renesys Services, to monitor the use of Renesys Services, and to gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on Renesys Services and evaluating Renesys Services in general.<br>
<a name="section 3"></a></p>
<h3>3. WHAT DOES RENESYS DO WITH THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</h3>
<p>In general, we use the information collected to provide Renesys Services to you and process your transactions, to help us understand who uses Renesys Services, for internal operations such as operating and improving Renesys Services, to contact you for customer service and billing purposes, and so that we and third parties can contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We may use your information to send you a welcoming email that may confirm your user name and password. We and third parties may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about Renesys Services, products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you no longer desire to receive these communications, you may change your preferences and “opt-out” of receiving them by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@renesys.com">privacy@renesys.com</a>. In addition, if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to send you important service announcements and updates regarding Renesys Services or, if applicable, about your billing account status. You will not be able to unsubscribe from these service announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to your use of Renesys Services.</p>
<p>We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve Renesys Services. We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve your experience with Renesys Services.<br>
<a name="section 4"></a></p>
<h3>4. WHEN DOES RENESYS DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?</h3>
<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you through Renesys Services.</p>
<p><b><i>Laws and Legal Rights.</i></b></p>
<p>We may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any terms of service for Renesys Services, to detect fraud, for assistance with delinquent accounts, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, Renesys Services or the general public.</p>
<p><b><i>Third Parties Generally.</i></b></p>
<p>We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of Renesys Services. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who use Renesys Services and the demographic breakdown of our users of Renesys Services. We may also provide to third parties personally identifiable information. For example, we might share our users’ responses to questionnaires and e-mail addresses with third parties in order for third parties to contact users about products and services that may be of interest. The third parties to which we may provide personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information may include merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.</p>
<p><b><i>Outside Contractors.</i></b></p>
<p>We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to Renesys Services, such as hosting and maintaining Renesys Services, providing payment processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for Renesys Services. In the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on Renesys Services, including your personally identifiable information. We require that these contractors (1)&nbsp;protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2)&nbsp;not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted.</p>
<p><b><i>Sale of Business.</i></b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Renesys, or that portion of Renesys to which Renesys Services relates, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Affiliates.</i></b></p>
<p>We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Corporate Affiliate” means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Renesys, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<a name="section 5"></a></p>
<h3>5. DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEB SITES OR SERVICES?</h3>
<p>Renesys Services may provide you with access to other websites and services. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites or services other than Renesys Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every such website and service. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through Renesys Services.<br>
<a name="section 6"></a></p>
<h3>6. IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH RENESYS SERVICES SECURE?</h3>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the security of our users’ information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems, including encryption systems, are foolproof. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes, or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any duty to protect your personally identifiable information which cannot be disclaimed, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty.<br>
<a name="section 7"></a></p>
<h3>7. COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?</h3>
<p>Personally-identifiable information collected on Renesys Services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and Renesys Services may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. By using Renesys Services and submitting such information on it, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information. If you are a user accessing Renesys Services from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from those of the United States, please be advised that all aspects of Renesys Services are governed by the internal laws of the United States and the State of New Hampshire, USA, regardless of your location.<br>
<a name="section 8"></a></p>
<h3>8. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must “opt-in” and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. You may also change your preference and “opt-out” of receiving certain marketing communications by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@renesys.com">privacy@renesys.com</a>.<br>
<a name="section 9"></a></p>
<h3>9. CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1)&nbsp;update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2)&nbsp;change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3)&nbsp;delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@renesys.com">privacy@renesys.com</a>. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identify before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
<p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.<br>
<a name="section 10"></a></p>
<h3>10. HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h3>
<p>You should be aware that we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time. However, we will not make changes that result in significant additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable information without allowing you to “Opt In” to such changes. We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that generally will not significantly affect our use of your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of Renesys Services following the posting of non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.<br>
<a name="section 11"></a></p>
<h3>11. WHOM DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE ANY PRIVACY QUESTIONS?</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or feel that we are not abiding by the terms of this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Agent in any of the following ways:</p>
