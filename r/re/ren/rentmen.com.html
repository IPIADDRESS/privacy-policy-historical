You choose to publish or make known via Our Site and Services. User acknowledges and agrees that Company uses cookies, browser capabilities,
web beacons, features and functionalities, tracking services, and other technology to collect information about User in order to enhance User's experience on the sites.
The collection of this data is intended to improve site navigation; maintain tracking of preferences; provide general internal and user web analytics reports; conduct

</p>
<p>

<p>E. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities seeking information about Our end users to the extent required by applicable law.

</p>
<p class="txtWhite txtBold mrgTop5 txt24">XI. Our Commitment to Data Security</p>
<p>
We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive user information. We make every reasonable effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems. Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party â€˜hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals, We are unable to guarantee that Our security is one hundred percent (100%) breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.
