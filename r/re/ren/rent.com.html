We value the trust you place in Rent.com. That's why we insist upon the highest standards for property advertisements and customer information privacy. Please read the following statement to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices. <b>Note: Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time.</b> To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.
<p>
Rent.com is a technology platform owned and operated by Viva Group, Inc.  The rental advertisements and related services posted on Rent.com are procured and provided by Viva Group, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates as listed <a href="/company/subsidiary/">here</a>.  In some cases, Viva Group, Inc. provides certain technical, marketing support, and customer support services to the subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
<p>Viva Group, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of eBay Inc. All references to "Rent.com", "we", or "us" include Viva Group, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates including eBay Inc. and its subsidiaries.
</p><p>

</p><p><b>1. Scope.</b><br>
<br>
This privacy policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services available through the <a href="/">website</a> (the "Website"). By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective five (5) days after "Last Update" date listed below for all other users.
</p><p>

</p><p><b>2. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.</b><br>
<br>
While you can browse some sections of the Website without being a registered user, certain activities (such as searching for properties, viewing property contact infromation, and registering a property) do require registration. In most cases, this information will be gathered from the Website but it may also include personal information we gather from private-label, co-branded, and affiliate websites. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Our servers are located in the United States. Therefore, if you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information. We may collect and store the following personal information:</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<li>name, email address, address, telephone number, and (depending on the service used), move-in dates, sometimes financial information such as credit card or bank account numbers;
</li><li>transactional information based on your activities on the Website (such as search information);
</li><li>other transactional information (such as guest card information, lease terms, lease parties);
</li><li>computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Website, and ad data;
</li><li>other information, including IP address and standard web log information; and
</li><li>supplemental information from third parties. (For example, if you incur a debt to Rent.com, we may conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law. As another example, if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information (such as your driver's license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address) or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity).
</li></blockquote><p>

</p><p><b>3. Use.</b><br>
<br>
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. For example, we may use your personal information and share your personal information within our corporate family to:
</p><blockquote>
<li>provide the services and customer support you request, including confirming emails related to the Website services, reminders, and transaction;
</li><li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
</li><li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;
</li><li>customize, measure, and improve our services and the Website's content and layout;
</li><li>tell you about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;
</li><li>compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;
</li><li>do other things for you as described when we collect the information;
</li><li>help promote a safe service;
</li><li>measure consumer interest in our products and services;
</li><li>inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates;
</li><li>customize your experience;
</li><li>detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity;
</li><li>enforce our agreements, terms, conditions, and policies; and
</li><li>as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
</li></blockquote>
In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyze demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our Website. We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We will occasionally ask you to complete optional surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our Website, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in, and to display content according to your preferences.<p>

</p><blockquote>
<b>Rent.com Renters:</b><br>
Our Website requires you to give us contact information and move-in date. We use this information to create a unique user account, and to send you relevant apartment advertisements, reward claim reminders, offers for moving-related services, and other information related to our services and Website. Further, when you contact a Lessor via the Website, we capture your telephone number and may contact you via telephone.<p>

<b>Rent.com Roommates:</b><br>
Our Website requires you to give us contact and personal information, including your email address, gender, age, lifestyle, marital status, occupation, and other personal and lifestyle information. We may use your email address to verify your identity, and send you messages from roommates interested in contacting you. (Messages sent between roommates through Rent.com's Message Center do not reveal the user's email addresses unless included by the user in the message content.) We use personal information to provide you with relevant roommate matches.</p><p>

<b>Rent.com Owners &amp; Managers:</b><br>
Our Website's registration form requires you to give us contact information (name, title, address, phone number, and email address) and billing information. We may also ask you for your credit card information. We use this information to establish and/or verify your identity, notify you about communication from Rent.com Renters, enable Rent.com Renters to view your property's listing, and send to you online and offline information about the Website and our services.</p><p>

<b>Moving Quotes Requesters:</b><br>
You may be offered an opportunity to request a quote for moving services through our Website. In such case, we will collect your contact information (including name, address, phone number, and email address) as well as information related to your move. By requesting this quote and submitting your information, you are expressly consenting to our using and selling that information to third-party moving companies and authorizing such moving companies to contact you regarding their services.</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses; see the <i>Choice/Opt-Out</i> section below.<p>

<b>4. Cookies.</b><br>
<br>
A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a website's server on a website's browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. Rent.com places both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive. Our permanent cookies allow us to provide personalized features, such as automatically logging you into your personalized Start page. In order to use this feature, you must set your browser's preferences to allow permanent cookies. We also use temporary cookies (a.k.a. "per-session cookies") to improve the functionality and usability of our Website. These temporary cookies are permanently erased from your computer as soon as you log out of your Rent.com account or link to a different website from your parent browser window. In order to use Rent.com, you must set your browser's preferences to allow per-session cookies (most web browsers automatically accept cookies). We may use third-party advertising companies&nbsp;such as DoubleClick to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Please visit the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" title="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">DoubleClick</a> Web site for more information about its business practices, privacy policies, and how to "opt-out".
</p><p>

<b>5. Sharing of information.</b><br>
<br>
We may also disclose personal information if permitted to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process.</p><p>
We may also share some or all of your personal information with:
</p><blockquote>
<li>law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
</li><li>another business entity should we (or our assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a transaction occur, that other business entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information.
</li><li>service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, invoicing, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards).
</li></blockquote>

<b>6. Lead Responder.</b><br>
<br>
When a Renter contacts a Lessor through the Website (by clicking on the "contact now") button or by calling the Website-issued telephone number of the Lessor, e.g., (866) 829-1234 ext. 1212 using a telephone, we will collect the Renter's telephone number, and other information related to the communication. If the Lessor communicates with the Renter by dialing that telephone number or by email, we will collect information related to that communication.  If the communication is by telephone, we will collect information related to the call, including its duration, but we will not collect the content of the telephone call. If the communication is by email, we will collect the content of the email in addition to other information related to the email.  We may share with Lessors a log of these communications, to allow them to manage their communications with Renters.  Without limiting any other provisions of this Policy, you expressly agree that we may use this data ("impression data") to enforce our rights to collect fees payable by the Lessors.<p>

<b>7. Links to Other Sites.</b><br>
<br>
Our website links to other websites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. Rent.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.</p><p>

<b>8. Security Precautions.</b><br>
<br>
Our website has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Once your information is in our possession we adhere to strict security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized access.</p><p>

<b>9. Choice/Opt-Out.</b><br>
<br>
Rent.com provides all users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us on behalf of our partners, and from us in general, after setting up an account. To remove your contact information from all Rent.com lists and newsletters, simply <a href="/account/preferences/">edit your email preferences</a>.</p><p>

<b>10. Account Protection.</b><br>
<br>
Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your Rent.com password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Rent.com and change your password.</p><p>

<b>11. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.</b><br>
<br>
You can see, review and change most of your personal information by logging into the Website. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p><p>

<b>12. Security.</b><br>
<br>
Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Website. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p><p>

<b>13. Third Parties</b><br>
<br>
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are Renters, Lessors, Roommates or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Since Rent.com does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p><p>

<b>14. General</b><br>
<br>
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Website. All amended terms automatically take effect 5 days after they are initially posted on the Website.</p><p>
