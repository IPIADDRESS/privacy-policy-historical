<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This is a notice to tell you our policy about all information that we record about you. It covers both information that could identify you and information that could not.</p>
<h3>The information we gather</h3>
<p>The information we gather from you includes your personal details, including your name and address, your email address, technical information which we gather from your computer through cookies (explained below) and information relating to complaints you make through this website. We may also receive information from you in the course of correspondence with you. Except for technical information gathered through cookies we do not gather any information from you other than such information as you yourself enter into this website.</p>
<p>The information we gather from you is used to provide you with the services this website was made for, to communicate with you (including to send you news about our website) and to compile statistics. It is not possible to identify you from the statistics.</p>
<p>We will not disclose your personal information to any third party except in relation to a service provided by this website that you use in order to pass the information about your complaint to the company or onto the Ombudsman or Regulator.  Your data may also be used in conjunction with third party software such as Google Analytics.</p>
<p>You may update your personal information on this website at any time in the 'account' section.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>This website uses the following cookies for Google Analytics to determine which pages you visit. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard disk through your web browser when you visit a web site. They are widely used to make web sites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>
<p>
We currently use cookies for Google Analytics and to track your session once you have logged in. You may read more about cookies used in conjunction with Google Analytics here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics</a>
</p>
<p>We may also use cookies that enable our web server to identify you to us, and to track your actions and the pages you visit while you use our website. The cookies we use may last for a single visit to our site (they are deleted from your computer when you close your browser), or may remain on your computer until you delete them or until a defined period of time has passed.</p>
<p>Although your browser software enables you to disable cookies, we recommend that you allow the use of cookies in order to take advantage of the features of our website that rely on their use. If you prevent their use, you may not be able to use all the functionality of our website.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the ways we use cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>to record whether you have accepted the use of cookies on our web site. This is solely to comply with the law. If you have chosen not to accept cookies, we will not use cookies for your visit, but unfortunately, our site will not work well for you.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Our servers</h3>
<p>At any given time our server or servers will be based in the United Kingdom, another EEA member country, in the United States of America (provided the host is 'safe harbour' compliant) or in a country which the European Commission have decided to deem to have an adequate level of protection for personal data. Accordingly data obtained from you may be “processed” outside the United Kingdom, but only in a country (or by a company) deemed to have sufficient data protection standards by the relevant authorities or by law.</p>
<h3>Disclosure to Government</h3>
<p>We may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.</p>
