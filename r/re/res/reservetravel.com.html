      <p><b>How we use your information</b><br>
        When you make a reservation through Alliance Reservations Network or one 
        of its affiliates, we will provide the hotel, airline, car rental agency 
        or other travel provider you designate with a limited amount of information

        information) for the express purpose of placing and confirming your reservation 
        with the designated travel provider.</p>
      <p><b>How we store personal data</b><br>
        All of your data is transmitted via an encrypted message (SSL) to our

        is not accessible via the Internet. </p>
