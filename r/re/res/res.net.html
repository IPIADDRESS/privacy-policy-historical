                PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OUR VISITORS, USERS AND CUSTOMERS</h4>
            <p>
                We gather personal information about you so we can deliver better service to you. We make reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal and other information is secure and to treat that personal and
                other information in a responsible manner. We collect the personal information that you voluntarily give us and that you give us in response to our request when you choose to purchase a product from us
                or use one of our services. For example, when you register with this website, you will be asked to provide personal and other information such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, and telephone
                number. Registration is generally required to use the functions of this website. Likewise, we will ask you to provide contact information if you use one of our services that connects you to other visitors,
                users, customers, affiliated businesses or third party providers of goods, products or services, if you request that we send you e-newsletters or other promotional notices or if you seek information or
                assistance from us.</p>
            <p>
                If you purchase a good, product or service, we will ask you for financial information such as your credit card number, debit card number, bank account routing and account number or other financial information
                in addition to asking for your telephone number, billing address, your preferred shipping address and other information we may believe is pertinent. We may gather additional personal information from
                you in relation with your use of certain optional services or features offered within or through our website. If you register or elect to receive e-mails, messages or e-newsletters, you may be asked to
                provide information concerning your personal interests. We may also collect personal information from the criteria of your search lists, characteristics of your wish lists or reminders.
            </p>
            <p>
                You understand and accept that when and if you upload video/audio/graphic/data content to this website containing your personal information, that you voluntarily place such content in a domain that may
                be collected and/ or used by other third parties. When you upload such content to this website you do so at your own risk and you agree to assume all responsibility for this action and the corresponding
                consequences. You further agree to hold this website, its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless for any and all harm, injury, damage and liability associated with
                your election to upload such content into this website.
            </p>
            <h4>
                OTHER KINDS OF COLLECTED VISITOR, USER OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                We may also obtain personal information about you such as contact information, updated address, shipping instructions and credit information from agents, consultants, contractors, carriers or other third
                parties. We may also collect contact and other information about prospective customers so that they may be contacted concerning goods, products or services that we believe may be of interest to them.</p>
            <p>
                Additionally, our computer and software systems keep track of technical information about your computer or mobile device, such as the browser type and version; browser plug-in types and versions, and
                operating system of your computer; the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other provider you use to access certain of our services; and your internet protocol (IP) address, location, and time zone setting.
                These computer and software systems automatically collect information about how you were directed to them; how you navigate around them; what channels, groups, associations, favorites and networks you
                enroll in; what other users, visitors or customers with whom you elect to communicate; the content you watch; the size and frequency that you may upload or download content to or from this website; the
                nature, substance and relevance of the content that you may upload or download to or from this website; what goods, products or services you browse; and your purchasing activities to help us to better
                understand the use of our website and services by our website visitors, users and customers; to improve your experience; and to aid us in marketing and managing our services.</p>
            <h4>
                HOW THIS INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h4>
            <p>
                When you register with this website, we compile the personal information you give us about yourself into an individual profile and thereafter add other personal information about you to that profile as
                we obtain it. We also collect information about your actions in using this website; the content that you choose to view, upload and download within, to, or from this website; the purchases you make; and
                other uses of our website and services as they occur. Personal and other information about prospective customers may be collected by us or obtained from our business partners or other third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our computer and software systems automatically gather other information (including the technical information identified above) when you access certain features of our website and services, including
                through the use of cookies and web beacons.</p>
            <h4>USE OF COOKIES</h4>
            <p>
                Cookies enhance our ability to serve you. Cookies are pieces of text that a website stores on your computer – an identification code of sorts. This cookie can be accessed by the website
                when you revisit it. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies terminate shortly after you terminate your internet session. Persistent cookies are stored on
                your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies help provide an enhanced user experience since they recall your use of the Internet, this website and our services, shopping preferences,
                shopping cart information, and your password.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable
                cookies, but we recommend that you leave cookies turned on so that you can take full advantage of the shopping features we offer.</p>
            <h4>
                USE OF WEB BEACONS</h4>
            <p>
                Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on web pages to track how visitors arrive at a website and what they do there. We use web beacons to track customers' visits to and browsing
                activities at our website and to compile sales and statistical data. This information assists us in marketing and managing our website and enhancing your experience with us.</p>
            <h4>
                REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE REQUESTED PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                Personal information is required for you to use this website, become a customer, make a purchase, request information or assistance, or take advantage of certain services and features we offer.
            </p>
            <h4>
                HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                Credit information is encrypted by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when it is transmitted to us via the Internet to any website address beginning with https. The servers that store this information
                are located in a facility with restricted access. We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order.</p>
            <h4>
                USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS</h4>
            <p>
                We use your personal information to better target the information you access in and through this website, to fulfill and process your orders and to connect
                you with other goods, products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. This includes for example, contacting you to confirm your order, fulfilling it, and delivering it. We may also contact
                you about your order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we will use your contact information to send you e-newsletters or other promotional notices, or to respond to requests for information or assistance from you.</p>
            <p>
                We may also use your personal information to improve our service to you, to customize the content you see, and for research, marketing, and other business purposes. For example, we periodically review
                customer information as part of servicing our accounts. We may also contact you from time to time to inform you of the services that we offer and to gather information about how we can improve them.</p>
            <p>
                Finally, we analyze information we obtain automatically from our computer and software systems, including from cookies and web beacons, concerning our customers' use of, access to, and navigation of our
                services and their browsing and purchasing activities to improve, customize, and market our services and content, to enhance our visitor, user and customer experience, and for research, marketing, and
                other business purposes.</p>
            <h4>
                WE SOMETIMES SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h4>
            <p>

                credit card companies (for example, American Express, Visa, UPS, and USPS). Similarly, if you order a product that is shipped directly from another company, or offered by us in conjunction with another
                company, we will share personal information about that order with the other company.</p>
            <p>
                We may use third party agents, consultants, and contractors to perform business functions on our behalf; including, but not limited

                and files we gather to perform these functions on our behalf. These third party entities are NOT authorized to use that information for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional services and features we offer. If you ask us to send content or a particular product to another person
                or entity or use a website feature that is intended to communicate with another visitor, user, customer or an affiliated business entity, we will tell that person or entity that we are sending the content,
                product, e-mail or other communication at your request. If you use one of our community network functions, the content of your posting will be available to all other participants to view and will be accompanied
                by your user name or chosen nickname.</p>
            <p>
                It is possible that we or part of our business or one of our affiliates could merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business entity and your personal information could be among the assets transferred.
                If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail or notice on this website or one of our other services.</p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our business affiliates in the course of our business operations. We also reserve the right to share personal information about you when
                we believe this to be appropriate to comply with the law or in cooperation with legal authorities; to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use governing use of this website and the terms and conditions
                of use governing the use of our other services; or to protect the rights, property, safety, or other interests of our visitors, users and customers.</p>
            <h4>
                WE SOMETIMES SHARE OTHER KINDS OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h4>
            <p>
                We may share non-personal, non-individually identifiable information about our visitors, users and customers with the group of people and entities with whom we share personal information, as well as with
                other third parties such as vendors, advertisers, and marketing firms.</p>
            <h4>
                SOME INFORMATION COLLECTED CAN BE VIEWED AND CHANGED</h4>
            <p>
                You can review some of your personal profile at this website and correct or update it by editing your profile. You can also change personal information such as your shipping address or payment method
                when ordering.</p>

            <h4>
                THIRD PARTY AFFINITY PROGRAMS</h4>
            <p>
                Occasionally, we participate in rewards programs with other business organizations where customers who are also members of these businesses will get a credit or a reward for their use or purchases from
                the other member organizations. We also sometimes advertise our goods, products and services on other websites or with other business entities in the form of a link so that visitors can click over to
                our website and purchase the services or products if they are interested. In these situations, we share information about our visitors, users and customers (including purchases) with these other member
                organizations and other services under the contracts these entities have with us.</p>
