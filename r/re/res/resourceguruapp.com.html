				<li><h3 id="why-else-do-we-use-your-info">Why Else Do We Use Your Information?</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Common uses of your information. We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to do so. Although in limited circumstances we may use your information because you have specifically consented to it, we generally use your information in the ways set out in this policy because:
							<ol>
								<li>we need to perform a contract we have entered into with you.</li>
								<li>we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
								<li>it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and rights do not override those interests.</li>
								<li>we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) or where it is needed in the public interest (although these circumstances are likely to be rare).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Change of purpose. We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it as set out in this policy, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="sharing-your-information">Sharing Your Information</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>As well as any sharing listed above, we may also share your information with third parties, including third-party service providers and other entities in our group. Third parties are required to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law. We never sell your data to third parties.</li>
						<li>Why might we share your personal information with third parties? We may share your personal information with third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our agreements with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
						<li>Which third-party service providers process your personal information? We also may need to share your personal information for third-party service providers (including contractors and designated agents) so that they can carry out their services.</li>
						<li>The following activities are carried out by third-party service providers: legal advice, contract administration, order fulfilment, delivery, administration, accountancy, IT services, payment processing, analytics, communications.</li>
						<li>When might we share your personal information with other entities in the group? We may share your personal information with other entities in our group as part of our regular reporting activities on company performance, in the context of a business reorganisation or group restructuring exercise, and for system maintenance support and hosting of data.</li>
						<li>How secure is your information with third-party service providers and other entities in our group? All our third-party service providers and other entities in the group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf as “data processors” they must do so only on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.</li>
						<li>What about other third parties? We may share your personal information with other third parties, for example in the context of the possible sale or restructuring of the business where necessary in connection with the purposes which your information was collected for. We may also need to share your personal information with a regulator or to otherwise comply with the law.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="where-we-store-your-information">Where We Store Your Information</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Our office headquarters are based in the UK and our main data centre is located in the USA. However, where required to perform our contract with you or for our wider business purposes, the information that we hold about you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UK and the EU. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the UK and EU who work for us or for one of our service providers. In particular, we operate in the following countries outside the EU: the USA and South Africa.</li>
						<li>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Some countries or organisations outside of the UK and the EU which we may transfer your information to will have an “adequacy decision” in place, meaning the EU considers them to have an adequate data protection regime in place. These are set out on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">European Commission website</a>.</li>
						<li>If we transfer data to countries or organisations outside of the UK and the EU which the EU does not consider to have an adequate data protection regime in place, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards (for example, model clauses approved by the EU or a data protection authority) are put in place where required. To obtain more details of these safeguards, please <a href="/contact-resource-guru">contact us</a>.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="data-security">Data Security</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>As well as the measures set out above in relation to sharing of your information, we have put in place appropriate internal security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. </li>
						<li>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where necessary.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="how-long">How Long Will We Keep Information For?</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>We will retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to keep your information for longer than that in order to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. </li>
						<li>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</li>
						<li>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Data protection law gives you a number of rights when it comes to personal information we hold about you. The key rights are set out below. More information about your rights can be obtained from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).  Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
							<ol>
								<li>Be informed in a clear, transparent and easily understandable way about how we use your personal information and about your rights. This is why we are providing you with the information in this policy. If you require any further information about how we use your personal information, please let us know. </li>
								<li>Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
								<li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
								<li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it (for instance, we may need to continue using your personal data to comply with our legal obligations). You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
								<li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to us using your information on this basis and we do not have a compelling legitimate basis for doing so which overrides your rights, interests and freedoms (for instance, we may need it to defend a legal claim). You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
								<li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
								<li>Request the transfer of your personal information to another party where you provided it to us and we are using it based on your consent, or to carry out a contract with you, and we process it using automated means.</li>
								<li>Withdraw consent. In the limited circumstances where we are relying on your consent (as opposed to the other bases set out above) to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate interest in doing so.</li>
								<li>Lodge a complaint. If you think that we are using your information in a way which breaches data protection law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection supervisory authority (if you are in the UK, this will be the ICO).</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal information or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please <a href="/contact-resource-guru">contact us</a>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>No fee usually required. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</li>
						<li>What we may need from you. We may need to request specific information from you to help us understand the nature of your request, to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</li>
						<li>Timescale. Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We will respond to your request as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we will let you know.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>

				<li><h3 id="changes">Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail or otherwise. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</li>
