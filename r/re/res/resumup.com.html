By visiting the Resumup.com website (the "Website"), submitting information or using any of our services, or creating an account to use Resumup.com, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers Resumup.com's treatment of personally identifiable information (collectively with "Submitted Information" (as defined herein), the "Personal Information") that Resumup.com gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use the Resumup.com Service or register for a Resumup.com Account. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy covers Resumup.com's treatment of any Personal Information that Resumup.com's business partners share with Resumup.com. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Resumup.com does not own or control, or to individuals that Resumup.com does not employ or manage.</p><p>The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, e-mail address, blog or other personal website URL and any other information that would allow Resumup.com to identify you or contact you if needed.</p><p>In addition to the Personal Information mentioned, we may ask you to provide certain other information such as general demographic information, including age, gender, ZIP code, preferences, and interests. The information we gather from our users enables us to personalize and improve the Resumup.com Service.</p><p>We may receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way.

It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry.

Ad serving companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they display an online advertisement to you, and as such, they may be able to compile information over time about whether you reviewed or clicked on advertisements they display. These companies may use this information to display targeted advertisements and may associate this information with your subsequent visits, purchases or other activities on participating advertisers’ websites.</p><p>Resumup.com retains the discretion to amend or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, in its sole discretion.
