By visiting the Resumup.com website (the "Website"), submitting information or using any of our services, or creating an account to use Resumup.com, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy covers Resumup.com's treatment of personally identifiable information (collectively with "Submitted Information" (as defined herein), the "Personal Information") that Resumup.com gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use the Resumup.com Service or register for a Resumup.com Account. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy covers Resumup.com's treatment of any Personal Information that Resumup.com's business partners share with Resumup.com. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Resumup.com does not own or control, or to individuals that Resumup.com does not employ or manage.</p><p>The types of Personal Information collected may include your full name, e-mail address, blog or other personal website URL and any other information that would allow Resumup.com to identify you or contact you if needed.</p><p>In addition to the Personal Information mentioned, we may ask you to provide certain other information such as general demographic information, including age, gender, ZIP code, preferences, and interests. The information we gather from our users enables us to personalize and improve the Resumup.com Service.</p><p>We may receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way.

If you choose to sign in through these Social Networks, we use the information you have already provided to such Social Networks in registering for an account with such Social Networks and which you have allowed such Social Networks to share with Resumup.com, including, but not limited to, your first name, your user profile picture, your friends and contacts list, and the networks to which you belong (collectively, your "Submitted Information").</p><p>You expressly authorize us to collect and use your Submitted Information in connection with your use of the Resumup.com Services. You further acknowledge and agree that Resumup.com may, but is not obligated to, maintain copies of your Submitted Information indefinitely, or delete any or all Submitted Information, at our sole discretion.</p><p>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website and/or Resumup.com Service. Resumup.com may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</p><p>You have the right to assign to your personal page a short (sub-domain) name replacing the id ordinal number for web addressing purposes. The sub-domain name cannot be selected from the words and names the use of which is prohibited in accordance with these Terms, legislation and international legal acts, including without limitation obscene words, names registered as trademarks, brand names and commercial designations, unless you are their exclusive owner. We reserve the right to remove or reclaim any user sub-domain name if we believe it is appropriate.</p><p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will be used only by Resumup.com and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, and your personal information will not be disclosed to any other third party without your consent.</p><p>Resumup.com occasionally hires other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or performing statistical analysis of the Services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such personal information as necessary for them to deliver the service. Those companies are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Resumup.com, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
