When you deactivate your personal information on Provider Applications we will retain logs and non-personally identifiable information about you along with an archival copy of your information, which is not accessible by you or third parties on Provider Applications but which might be used by us for recordkeeping and internal purposes, including enforcing this Policy and demographic, reporting and research purposes.</p>

<p>6. Information You Share on the Site</p>
<p>If you participate in Provider services (e.g., resume posting, profile creation, Job Alerts) that permit you or Provider on your behalf to post information on third party sites (e.g., websites, bulletin boards, personal urls) and if you post information or content, such as by posting photos, or participating in online forums or communities, when you interact with our Site through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. We cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.</p>
<p>a) Other services: If you use the Site, Provider may create a universal application derived from the information you provide on the Site that will be visible to potential employers who have immediate needs for prospects as well as visitors to the Site. Therefore, your Site Profile may be publically viewable. You may elect to have your Profile restricted to registered users only by following the instructions on the Site for that particular setting. You agree that employers and Provider will use the contact information you have provided to contact you by e-mail and/or SMS text and you understand that this consent is not a condition to having access to the Site or Provider services. Message and data rates may apply.</p>

<ul>
<li>We may offer certain features that are available only through the use of tracking technologies.</li>
<li>We use both session and persistent tracking technologies. Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</li>
<li>We encode and protect the tracking technologies that Provider sets, so that only we can interpret the information stored in them You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers, that we have allowed on our Site that assist us with various aspects of our Site operations and services, such as Google Analytics.</li>

You should promptly update your personal information if it changes or becomes inaccurate. We may retain some information from closed accounts so that we can comply with law, prevent fraud, assist with investigations, resolve disputes, analyze or troubleshoot programs, enforce our Terms of Use, or take other actions permitted by law. Likewise if your account or membership is terminated or suspended, we may maintain some information to prevent re-registration. For non-registered members, you may update or request to access your personal information by contacting us as set forth in Section 15.</p>
<p>We will endeavor to comply with your requests as soon as reasonably possible but please note that changes requested of us may not be effective immediately.

<p>9. Notice to California Residents</p>
<p>a) California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at californiarequest@bold.com. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>
<p>b) California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575 (b) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Provider responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Provider does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been adopted. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is universally accepted.</p>
<p>10. Third Parties</p>
<p>Our Site may contain links to other third party websites and Provider may provide products and services that share information with third party sites for your job search. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third party sites so it is important to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies before providing your personal information.</p>
<p>11. Security</p>
<p>We maintain technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect the security of your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or alteration.

It is your responsibility to make sure that your personal information is accurate.</p>

If you are a minor and want to remove the information you posted to the Site, please contact us via the email or mailing address listed in Section 15 below. Removal of the information you posted does not ensure its complete or comprehensive removal.</p>
<p>13. Storage and International Transfer</p>
<p>As we operate internationally, and many of our computer systems are currently based globally, for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy your personal information may be stored and processed elsewhere by us, our affiliates or an unaffiliated service provider. The data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union.
