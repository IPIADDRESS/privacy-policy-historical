write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your
visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of
our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on

6.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify">(b)Web Beacons. A web beacon is a programming code that can be
used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your
unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously
acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Company to
track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral
habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be
interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses

may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or
not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your
computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP")
is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by your
Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network
("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently
assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web
servers, collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP
address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation
of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP
address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or
which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses,
and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
