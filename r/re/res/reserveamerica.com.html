                          handle it. This privacy policy only applies to transactions 
                          made, and data gathered, on the ReserveAmerica.com web 
                          site (the "Site") and does not apply to any

                          to check for revisions as we may update it from time 
                          to time. This privacy policy was last revised on October 
                          18, 2002. Each time you visit the Site or provide us 
                          with information, by doing so you are accepting the 
                          practices described in this privacy policy at that time.<br>

                          with our Site, we may use your IP address to help identify

                          specific to your interests, to save your password, and 
                          to save other personal and financial information so 
                          you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the 
                          Site. Advertisers and other third parties may also place

                          the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However,

                          you, we may collect "personal information"

                          Some of these other web sites may contain our brand

                          have requested and to contact you when necessary in 
                          connection with transactions entered into by you on 
                          the Site (including reservation confirmations, changes 
                          and cancellations). We also use your personal information 
                          so that we can send you information, offers, promotional 
                          materials and newsletters. We carefully select the information 
                          we send to you and attempt to send you offers and promotions 
                          that are of value to you, such as discounts or exclusive 
                          offers offered by third parties. The Site provides you 
                          with the option of declining (i.e., "opting-out" 
                          of) receiving these offers, promotional materials and 
                          newsletters. We will not make direct use of public agency

                          financial information (other than telephone numbers

                        <p>By making reservations on the Site for campgrounds

                          Due to our contractual obligations with certain Reservation

                          that uses financial information, on the Site, you consent 
                          to our providing your financial information to our service

                          and banking institutions used to process the transaction. 
                          Also, depending on the circumstances of our arrangements, 
                          we may share your financial information with applicable
