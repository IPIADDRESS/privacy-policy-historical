For example, you may enter your information in order to reserve a campsite or purchase a campsite permit or a hunting or fishing license. Relatedly, organizations and entities that use our Services to provide a service to Consumers (our “Clients”) (including agents of our Clients) may provide us with personal information about individuals who have reserved a campsite or purchased a hunting or fishing license or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.</p></div><h3 class="paragraph paragraph--type--heading paragraph--view-mode--default font-family--none text-transform--none">Information We Collect Directly From You.</h3><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--longtext paragraph--view-mode--default"><p><em>Account Information for our Sites.</em>&nbsp;You may browse our Sites without creating an online account or providing us with your information, but to use certain features, you may need to create an account or otherwise provide us with information.

When you log into certain of our Applications, we will request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called “geolocation” information) so that we can provide location-related services, for example, so that we can help you to find a campground, locations to purchase equipment, and other valuable information. In the “settings” function on your phone, you will have the ability to manually permit or preclude us from recording your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications.</p><p><em>Contests, Surveys and Questionnaires.</em>&nbsp;When you sign up for sweepstakes or contests, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect information that you submit to us. We use this information to administer the sweepstakes, contest or survey, to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you, to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy.</p><p><em>Licenses, Reservations, Permits, and Fines.</em>&nbsp;When you purchase hunting or fishing licenses, camping permits, or submit payment for fines, we may require additional information about you in order to complete your request. For example, we may need your driver’s license number, social security number, or visa or passport number in order to verify your identity and process your request. In addition, we might collect public agency reservation information (e.g., information about your planned visit to a specific government agency-operated or government agency-administered campground or park, such as dates of stay or number of occupants, other than personal information). Any such personal information is used only as necessary in order to help complete your transaction.</p><p><em>User Profiles, Comments and Posts.</em>&nbsp;Some of our Sites and Applications may allow users to create or post content, such as comments, profiles, blogs, and messages. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites. Once posted, we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy. Your profile, however, may offer privacy settings within your account to help you manage how your content is displayed.</p><p><em>Job Site References.</em>&nbsp;As part of applying for employment with us, we may ask you for information such as details regarding your education, employment history, qualifications, and the contact information of a former colleague’s name.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on a Site. When Consumers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on one of our Sites. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Consumer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. We also collect non-personal data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect. This information also may be associated with your username and combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in certain contexts, we collect information on behalf of our Clients subject to contractual requirements that limit our ability to use and transfer your information in ways that are more narrow than those in this Policy (e.g., the information be only used as necessary to provide Services to the Client and/or for other specified purposes). In those limited circumstances, your information is subject to those contractual requirements and not to this Policy, subject to enforcement by the applicable Client. If your information is collected on behalf of a third party, it will be evident at the time that you provide such information. This Policy does not cover our Clients’ use of your information outside of our Services. You should contact that party directly to determine if your information is subject to such limitations on uses and to ascertain how the third party will make use of your information.</p></div><h2 class="paragraph paragraph--type--heading paragraph--view-mode--default font-family--none text-transform--none">When and how do we share your information?</h2><div class="paragraph paragraph--type--longtext paragraph--view-mode--default"><p><strong>Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp;We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, with non-affiliated and affiliated third parties.</p><p><em>Affiliates.</em>&nbsp;We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your information will be subject to this Policy.</p><p><em>Clients or Partners.</em>&nbsp;If you are using our Services to register for an activity or to purchase a third party product or service, we share the personal information that you provide with the applicable third parties in order to fulfill your request. You may receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from these entities; each such party operates independently from us and is not subject to this Policy but is subject to its own privacy policy. In some instances, we allow Clients to use our email system to contact Consumers, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Clients. Please refer to that party’s privacy policy if you have any questions about its use of your information.</p><p><em>Service Providers.</em>&nbsp;We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, these providers may help us administer our Sites and Applications, manage and administer activities, or process credit card payments. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of or information and may be located in a location different than where we operate. Where required by law, these companies agree to only use such information for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us unless you expressly permit them to use your information for other purposes.</p><p><em>Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties.</em>&nbsp;We may disclose the information that we collect about you to non-affiliated third parties (with your consent, if consent is required by law), such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. Those third parties may use your information for marketing purposes, such as to market products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. We also may combine the information that we collect about you with other information that we obtain from third parties. This information may help us to determine what advertisements to direct to you, to place on our Sites, and where to advertise our Services. As discussed in the advertising section below, you have the ability to opt-out of certain uses of your information. You also have the ability to opt-in to receiving certain information from us and non-affiliated third parties.</p><p><em>Supplemental Service Partners.</em>&nbsp;By purchasing, making reservations, or registering for, products or services offered by third parties as a result of your interaction with the Services or use of the Sites (such as magazine subscriptions), electing to receive communications (such as emails), or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted by you directly to us.</p><p><em>Strategic Partners.</em>&nbsp;We have integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Partners"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Partner’s application or service ("Integrated Service") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange Consumer data and to establish linked business processes between the two. Consumers who pay us for use of the Services and use this Integrated Service are considered customers of both Aspira and the Partner. We may share with Partners, and Partners may share with us, Consumer contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the Consumer. The sharing of this information allows us and the Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows the Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared Consumer and allows for the enhanced functionality of the Integrated Service. Information shared for these purposes is governed by this Policy.</p><p><em>Affiliate and Referral Partners.</em>&nbsp;We have referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their customers to us. We may share with Referral Partners, and Referral Partners may share with us, certain information with respect to a Consumer that is referred by us or a Referral Partner to allow us and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared Consumer and determine referral fees owed.</p><p><em>Government Clients.</em>&nbsp;By making reservations on the Sites for campgrounds, purchasing permits, purchasing hunting or fishing licenses, or using other services provided by government entities, you consent to us sharing your personal information and public agency reservation information with the government agencies and other third parties associated with the registration, purchase, or reservation you are making or service you are using ("Government Agency Partners"). Government Agency Partners may use your personal information and public agency reservation information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those Government Agency Partners who contact you to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information and public agency reservation information by them.</p><p>We also may share your information for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the acquiring company. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquiror will continue to have the right to use your information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p></li><li><p>In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, such as in response to a subpoena.</p></li><li><p>To Protect Ourselves and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or violations of our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> or this Policy.</p></li><li><p>Aggregate and Anonymized Information. We may share aggregate or anonymized information about Consumers with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.
