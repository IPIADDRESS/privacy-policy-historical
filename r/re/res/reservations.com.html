As a Travelocity user, you are in control of all your travel-planning. We know you want to remain in control of your personal information as well. As one of the pioneers in online travel, we realize that earning and retaining your trust is of paramount importance and it's a responsibility we take very seriously, every day. 
</p>
<p>
That's why we've provided this Privacy Policy, which sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use and protection of the personal information of those using the Travelocity website. Personal information means information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number. 
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy, and become familiar with it, but you should know that <strong>we do not sell or rent our customers' personal information to third parties</strong>.
</p> 
<p>
Please note that we review our Privacy Policy from time to time, and we may make periodic changes to the policy in connection with that review. Therefore, you may wish to bookmark this page and/or periodically review this page to make sure that you have the current version.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains the following:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#info">What personal information we collect from you and how we use it</a> 
</li><li><a href="#share">With whom (if anyone) your personal information is shared</a>
</li><li><a href="#optout">How you can opt-out of receiving our promotional e-mails</a>
</li><li><a href="#access">How you can update or correct your personal information</a>

<p></p>

<p>	
<a name="info"></a><span style="font-weight:bold">What personal information does Travelocity gather from me and how is this information used?</span><br>
</p><p>
When browsing our site, you are not required to provide any personal information unless and until you choose to make a purchase or sign up for one of our e-mail newsletters or other services as described below. We do not knowingly permit the site to be used by any person under the age of eighteen and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children (meaning those younger than thirteen years of age). A valid credit card is required to make a purchase on our site. 
</p>

<p><i>Making a Purchase</i><br>
In order to purchase travel and related services through our site, you must provide us with certain personal information such as your name, your credit card number and expiration date, your credit card billing address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the name or names of the person(s) traveling (if not you). We may also ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent traveler numbers. We require this information so that we can process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep you informed of each transaction's status. If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other than yourself, you will need to make sure that each of these other travelers agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us. For your convenience, we make certain information about your reservation available to you or other persons authorized by you to receive such information. For example, if you forgot your flight number, you or another person authorized by you may retrieve that information from us after providing information sufficient in our eyes to confirm your identity or that such other person is authorized by you to receive that information. 
</p>  

<p><i>Member Registration</i><br>
If you choose to become a registered member of Travelocity, you must provide your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation, and a password hint to help you remember your password. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to complete air, hotel, car, and other reservations; (iii) to allow us to contact you for customer service purposes, if necessary; (iv) to customize the content of our site to meet your specific needs; and (v) to make product improvements to our site. In addition, we need your e-mail address to confirm your new member registration and each reservation you transact on our site. As a Travelocity member you will also occasionally receive updates from us about fare sales in your area, special offers, new Travelocity services, and other noteworthy items. However, you may choose at any time to no longer receive these types of e-mail messages. Please see our <a href="#optout">Opt-Out</a> policy described below for details. 
</p>

<p><i>Member Profile</i><br>
As a Travelocity member, you can choose to complete your online profile by providing us with travel preferences, frequent-traveler or affinity numbers, credit-card billing information, paper ticket delivery address, and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist you in making reservations quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. For example, you can store your airline frequent-flyer numbers so that when your make a reservation on that airline, we can automatically pre-fill the frequent-flyer number input box for you.
</p>

<p><i>Newsletters and FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span></i><br>
Travelocity's Real Deals and other newsletters and our FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> service are optional benefits you may choose to subscribe to that keep you up to date with the latest special travel deals and low airfares. FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> tracks the prices of airline tickets to your favorite places. When the price for one of your favorite trips changes based on your preferences, Travelocity will notify you of the change via e-mail. Your e-mail address and preferred round trip city pairs are necessary to receive FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> e-mails. 
</p>  

<p><i>Online Surveys</i><br>
Travelocity values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Travelocity and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. 
</p>

<p><i>Promotions &amp; Sweepstakes</i><br>
Travelocity frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give members the opportunity to win great travel and travel-related prizes. Information collected by us for such activities can include contact information and survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product improvements to the Travelocity.com web site.
</p>

<p><i>Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</i><br>
Travelocity may share your personal information with third parties when you engage in certain activities on our site that are sponsored by third parties, such as electing to receive information or communications from a third party (such as a hotel company or a tourism board for a particular destination), or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party. Travelocity may also share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials from Travelocity and authorize a third party to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. We refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities." When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that Travelocity may send your personal information (such as, in some cases, your mailing address or e-mail address) to the sponsor, and the sponsor may use your personal information in accordance with the sponsor's privacy practices.  <strong>In each case described in this section, Travelocity will only share your personal information after receiving your consent</strong>. You should know that when Travelocity shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this section, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by Travelocity's Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information.
</p>

<p><i>Automatic Logging of Session Data</i><br>
We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data".. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We may also use some session data, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail messages (such as "Good Day to Buy") focused on destinations that you may be interested in, unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages.
</p>      

<p><i>Cookies</i><br>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and Travelocity's use of cookies is similar to that of such sites as Expedia and Orbitz, as well as Yahoo!, CNN.com and other reputable online companies.<br><br>

First and foremost, you can rest assured that <strong>no</strong> personal information about you is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the Travelocity.com web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties.<br><br> 

Cookies allow us to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our site. Travelocity uses cookies to personalize your experience on our site and with respect to advertisements. As to the former, these types of cookies allow you to log in without having to type your log-in name each time (only your password is needed), let us know if you are a FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> participant or a Travelocity VIP, your preferred language and departure city, and so forth. We may also use such cookies to display an advertisement to you while you are on our website or to send you a "Good Day to Buy" email (or similar emails -- assuming you have not opted out of receiving such emails) focusing on destinations in which we think you might be interested. None of this information is passed to any third party and is used solely by us to provide you with a better user experience on our web site. <strong>No</strong> personal information about you is gathered through the use of these types of cookies.<br><br>
  
A cookie may also be placed by our advertising server. Such cookies are used only for purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising served by us on our site and no personal information about you is gathered from you by the use of these cookies, nor is this information shared with any third parties. Similarly, a cookie may be placed by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does <strong>not</strong> include your personal information.<br><br>
 
The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. No personal information about you is collected during this process. The information is anonymous and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. If you would like more information and want to explore the option of not having this information collected by third-party advertisers, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br><br>
 
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Of course, by changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser. Travelocity supports your right to block any unwanted Internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking Travelocity cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain services available on the site. Please note that it is possible to block cookie activity from certain web sites while permitting cookies from sites you trust, like Travelocity.

</p>

<p><i>Other</i><br>
From time to time we may add or enhance services available on the site. To the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you email us with a question, we will use your email address, name, nature of the question, etc. to respond to your question. We may also store such information to assist us in making the site the better and easier to use.

<p>
<a name="share"><span style="font-weight:bold">With whom (if anyone) will my personal information be shared?</span></a><br>

</p><p>
When you reserve or purchase travel services through Travelocity, we provide to the airline, hotel, car-rental agency, travel agency or other involved third party only that portion of your personal information that is needed for the successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements. We may also share personal information among our corporate affiliates at Sabre Holdings Corporation. For example, we book most of our travel services through the Sabre Global Distribution System, a leading processor of travel bookings worldwide which is operated by an affiliated company, and in doing so must provide certain of your personal information to them (as we would with any other GDS we now use or may use in the future). The Sabre privacy policy is available at <a href="http://sabre-holdings.com/privacy/coreData.html">http://sabre-holdings.com/privacy/coreData.html</a>. We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our site. We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites. Occasionally, Travelocity will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing, or will contract with a third party to provide co-branded products, such as a Travelocity credit card. In such cases, Travelocity will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for completing the specific project. See "<a href="#moreinfo">What other information should I know about my privacy?</a>" below.

</p><p>
Travelocity contains links to other web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another web site for which Travelocity has no responsibility.

In addition, if Travelocity or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.

</p><p>
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login name, or password, in an unsecure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>
