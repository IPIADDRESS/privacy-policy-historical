<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last modified on May 24th, 2018.</p>
<p>This policy describes Benjamin &amp; Brothers, LLC d/b/a Reservations.com’s (“Reservations.com”) practices regarding personally identifiable information and data. This policy applies to data received from our websites, applications, email, and text messages, call center, and social media accounts (the “Service”). When you use the Service, you agree to the terms in this policy.</p>
<h3><br>The categories of personal information we collect<br><br></h3>
<p><strong>Service information:</strong>&nbsp;When you use the Service, we may collect information from you. &nbsp;Some of it may be personal information. This information can include, but is not limited to, search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location.</p>

<p><strong>Consumer support:</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to contact consumer support, for example, through our call center or the messaging services on our websites, we will collect any inquires, complaint or other information that you may submit to our support team.</p>
<p><strong>Promotional information:</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to participate in a sweepstake, contests or similar campaign, we will collect any information you provide in relation to such activity such as photos, images, captions or other content, in accordance with the terms provided at that time.</p>
<p>When you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.</p>
<h3><br>How we collect your personal information<br><br></h3>

As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries and their jurisdiction over data held by Reservations.com, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information.</p>
<p>Reservations.com has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third parties to carry out the uses indicated in this policy. In addition, information collected by Google’s Invisible CAPTCHA is held in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We will use all commercially reasonable methods to keep personal information securely in our files and systems. With current technology, however, we cannot guarantee the security of your data from all possible attacks or intrusions on our servers or guarantee the security of your data as it travels over the Internet. Thus, you hereby release Reservations.com from liability for any such possible attacks or intrusions that might compromise the security of your data.</p>
<h3><br>Retention periods<br><br></h3>
<p>We retain your personal information for communications related to your booking, analytical purposes, as well as record keeping for as long as you have an account with Reservations.com.</p>
<p>We will also retain your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our contracts.</p>
<h3><br>Other websites<br><br></h3>
<p>You may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and consumer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.</p>
<h3><br>Minors<br><br></h3>
<p>The Site and the Service are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and Reservations.com does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>
<h3><br>Changes to this policy<br><br></h3>
<p>We may modify this policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of major changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Service after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.</p>
<h3><br>Rights with respect to personal information<br><br></h3>
<p>Certain jurisdictions provide their citizens with additional rights relating to data.&nbsp; Although the laws in these jurisdictions may not apply to Reservations.com, we will, where reasonably possible, provide the following services for users in jurisdictions where such rights apply:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access:&nbsp;</strong>You may be entitled at any time to obtain information about your personal information that we store, in accordance with applicable law and without any fee. However, in exceptional cases we ask you to pay reasonable fee before we provide the information if permitted by applicable law</li>
<li><strong>Rectification:&nbsp;</strong>You may request that we rectify any of your personal information that is incomplete or incorrect</li>
<li><strong>Deletion:&nbsp;</strong>You may request that we delete your account</li>
<li><strong>Objection:&nbsp;</strong>You may object, at any time, to your personal information being processed for direct marketing purposes</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions of processing:&nbsp;</strong>You may ask us to cease processing of your personal information for example if you have objected to the processing and the existence of legitimate ground is still under consideration</li>
<li><strong>Data portability:&nbsp;</strong>You may request us to send you your reservations in a commonly used and machine readable format which shall be decided on in Reservation.com sole discretion</li>
<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong>You may have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of our processing based on such consent before it was withdrawn</li>
</ul>
<p>We may request proof of your identity before acting upon any request. We may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in some cases. For example if your personal information is connected with personal information of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation why you cannot obtain this information. We may also deny your request for deletion or rectification of your personal information due to statutory provisions, especially those affecting Reservation.com accounting, processing of claims, and mandatory data retention, which may prohibit deletion or anonymization, or if you are from a jurisdiction that does not provide these rights.</p>
<h3><br>How to contact us or make a complaint<br><br></h3>

<h3>How Reservation.com responds to “do not track” signals<br><br></h3>
<p>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
<p>If you have any questions on our use of tracking tools, please use the <a href="/contact">feedback form</a>.</p>

If you are based outside the United States and decide to access the Service from your location outside of the United States, you hereby agree to be subject to this notice and waive all privacy-related rights in other jurisdictions that conflict with U.S. law or this policy.&nbsp; You should not provide us with any personal information unless you consent to the application of United States law and, where applicable, Florida law, and to the use and disclosure of your information in accordance with the terms of this policy.&nbsp;</p>
