<h3 class="c81head">5. WHY AND HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

<p>We may use personal information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li>to communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle;</li>
	<li>to deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management;</li>
	<li>to administer subscriptions of Oracle magazine and Profit magazine;</li>
	<li>to market our products and services or related products and services, and to tailor our marketing and sales activities to your or your company’s interests;</li>
	<li>to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process orders for Oracle products and services;</li>
	<li>to analyse, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services;</li>
	<li>to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems;</li>
	<li>to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business;</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>These purposes are described below in further detail. </p>

<p><strong>To communicate and respond to your requests and inquiries to Oracle</strong></p>

<p>If you get in touch with us (such as by submitting contact forms on our sites, attending Oracle events or other occasions, sending an email or by visiting social media platforms), we process information about you to communicate with you and to respond to your requests  or other inquiries. We can also process personal information to interact with you on third party social networks. </p>

<p><strong>To deliver functionality on our sites and for their technical and functional management </strong></p>
<p>When you choose to register with us (such as to make use of our communities), we need to process the personal information provided by you so that we can create and manage a personal account for you. Upon creating your account, we will send you your personal login information. This personal information enables us to administer your account, for example by changing your password for you. </p>


<p><strong>To administer subscriptions of Oracle magazine and Profit magazine</strong></p>
<p>If you subscribe to our magazines (such as “Oracle” or “Profit”), we process information about you to administer your subscription to our magazines (including the renewal process). </p>

<p><strong>To market our products and services or related products and services and to tailor marketing and sales activities </strong></p>
<p>Oracle may use information about you to notify you about new product releases and service developments, events, alerts, updates, prices, terms, special offers and associated campaigns and promotions (including via newsletters). Oracle may also use personal information to advertise Oracle's products and services or related products and services, and also to have our distributors, resellers or partners notify you about our products or services or their related products or services (such as  via joint sales or product promotions). We do our best to tailor your website visit, marketing experience and our communications to your expressed interests. This happens, for example, if you sign up for an Oracle community or program like the Oracle Partner Network or Oracle Technology Network.</p>
<p>If you attend an event, Oracle may process information about you gathered in relation to the event and can share information about your attendance with your company. Oracle may also permit designated event partners or conference sponsors to send you up to two communications related to your event attendance. Please note that our partners or conference sponsors may directly request information about you at their conference booths or presentations, and their use of your information that you provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
<p>We may also process your personal information to post testimonials on our sites, but will first obtain your consent to use your name and testimonial.</p>

<p><strong>To engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners and to process purchases of our products and services</strong></p>
<p>If you place an order for our products and services, or if you provide services to Oracle, our employees, customers or partners as a supplier or business partner, Oracle processes information about you to engage in and administer the relevant transactions (such as by sending invoices and making payments), administer your order, and help you get started and adopt our products and services (e.g., by contacting you to activate your Cloud services credits). If you download products or services from our sites, Oracle uses information about you to confirm certain information about your order (for example, that you did not experience problems in the download process).</p>

<p><strong>To analyse, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services</strong></p>
<p>We may process personal information in order to analyse, develop, improve and optimize the use, function and performance of our sites and products and services, as well as marketing and sales campaigns. In case the sites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, create a profile, post comments, opportunities or other content, or communicate directly with another user or otherwise engage in networking activities, Oracle may process personal information when moderating these activities.</p>

<p><strong>To manage the security of our sites, networks and systems</strong></p>
<p>We may collect site use data for security and operations management to help keep our sites, networks and systems secure, or to investigate and prevent potential fraud, including ad fraud and cyber-attacks and to detect bots.</p>

<p><strong>To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, we have to process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process personal information in the performance and operation of our business, such as to conduct internal audits and investigations or for finance and accounting and archiving and insurance purposes.</p>




<a class="atarget" id="6" name="6"></a>

<h3 class="c81head">6. WHAT IS OUR BASIS FOR PROCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</h3>

<p>For personal information collected about you in the EU, our basis for processing is the following:</p>

<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li>In order to communicate adequately with you and to respond to your requests, we need to process information about you and therefore have a <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in processing this information.</li>
	<li>In order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and downloads of our products and services, we need to process information about you <strong>as necessary to enter into or perform a contract</strong> with you.</li>
	<li>We process personal information for marketing and sales activities based on your <strong>consent</strong> where so indicated on our sites at the time your personal information was collected, or further to our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to market and promote our products and services.</li>
	<li>We rely on our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to analyse, develop, improve and optimize our sites, products and services, and to maintain the security of our sites, networks and systems.</li>
	<li>In order <strong>to comply with applicable laws and regulations</strong>, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to process an opt-out request.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<a class="atarget" id="7" name="7"></a>
<h3 class="c81head">7. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Oracle maintains personal information for the following retention periods:</p>

<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li>Information about you we collect to engage in transactions with our customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases of our products and services, will be retained for the duration of the transaction or services period, or longer as necessary for record retention and legal compliance purposes.</li>
	<li>If you have registered for an Oracle account, your account information will be retained for as long as you maintain an active account. Your account and account information will be deleted if you do not log in for 18 consecutive months. Oracle retains records of that deletion for 90 days.</li>
	<li>If you have registered for our newsletters and blogs, including Oracle magazine or Profit magazine, your subscription data will be retained for as long as you are subscribed to our distribution lists. Oracle retains records of that deletion for 30 days.</li>
	<li>Contact information such as your email address or phone number collected online on our sites or offline from our interactions with you at Oracle events and conferences, and used for direct marketing and sales activities will be retained for as long as we have an active (customer) relationship with you. We treat you as an active contact if (i) you have interacted with Oracle or updated your contact details and preferences in the past 18 months; and (ii) you have not made a deletion request.</li>
	<li>If you have reached out to us via Oracle Sales chat, we will delete all chat transcripts 90 days after the chat has concluded.</li>
	<li>Personal information needed to retain your opt-out preferences is retained for 20 years (or longer as necessary to comply with applicable law).</li>
</ul>
<br> 

<a class="atarget" id="8" name="8"></a>
<h3 class="c81head">8. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

<p><strong>Sharing within Oracle</strong></p>

<p>As a global organisation, information about you may be shared globally throughout Oracle's worldwide organisation. A list of Oracle entities is available <a href="/corporate/contact/global.html">here</a>. Please select a region and country to view the registered address and contact details of the Oracle entity or entities located in each country.</p>

<p>Oracle employees are authorised to access personal information only to the extent necessary to serve the applicable purpose(s) and to perform their job functions.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing with third parties</strong></p>

<p>We may share personal information with the following third parties:</p>

<ul class="obullets" style="margin-left:40px;">
	<li>Third-party service providers (for example, credit card processing services, order fulfilment, analytics, event/campaign management, website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, e-mail delivery, auditing, and other similar service providers) in order for those service providers to perform business functions on behalf of Oracle;</li>
	<li>Oracle distributors or resellers for further follow-up related to your interests, specific partners that offer complementary products and services or with third parties to facilitate interest-based advertising;</li>
	<li>Relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings);</li>
	<li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organisational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy, and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<a class="atarget" id="9" name="9"></a>
<h3 class="c81head">9. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY?</h3>

<p>Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries and personal information is processed globally. If personal information is transferred to an Oracle recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, Oracle will take measures designed to adequately protect information about you, such as ensuring that such transfers are subject to the terms of the EU Model Clauses. </p>

<p>Oracle also complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention when a customer and Oracle have agreed by contract that transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the Privacy Shield for the relevant services. When conducting those activities on behalf of its EEA or Swiss customers, Oracle holds and/or processes personal information provided by the EEA or Swiss customer at the direction of the customer. Oracle will then be responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our behalf do the same. Oracle has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>

With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Oracle is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities.</p>

<a class="atarget" id="10" name="10"></a>
