You should refer to that Client Agreement in addition to this Privacy Policy with regard to your use of the Responsys Web site and Responsys’ privacy obligations.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Collection</strong><br>

  <br>
  Responsys uses "cookies" and "web beacons" to collect data. A cookie is a small text file containing a random and unique identifier that either Responsys or its third party web analytics provider on behalf of Responsys transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (unless you set your browser to reject cookies) that enables Responsys or its third party web analytics provider’s system to recognize your browser. &nbsp;&nbsp;Responsys uses cookies to track your movement through the Web site and verify the login status of client using products or services linked directly within the Responsys Web site.&nbsp; Cookies are also used to track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs or to track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign.&nbsp; Neither Responsys nor its third party web analytics provider store any personally identifiable information in cookies. &nbsp;Web beacons (also known as clear gifs) are typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site are used by Responsys and its third party web analytics provider in combination with cookies to help us understand how you interact with the Responsys Web site.&nbsp; We use web beacons to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor experience, and to manage site content.<br>

  <strong>Security and Privacy</strong><br>
  Responsys' web site uses security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We store the information in a database in a secure environment at our data hosting service providers, Savvis Communications and AT&amp;T.<br>
  <br>
  Responsys takes care to reinforce the importance of our web site visitors' security and privacy among our employees. Responsys requires unique usernames and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on to Responsys’ client interface. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of all data. The bottom line is that, because our business involves hosting application accounts, data security is paramount. We're constantly reevaluating and deploying new technologies to enhance our security.<br>
  <br>
  In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets.&nbsp; In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.&nbsp; In the event that all or substantially all of Responsys’ assets are acquired in a transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred. &nbsp;&nbsp;Such a transaction will be disclosed per the "Notification of Privacy Policy Changes" guidelines above. Also, as with the data we collect on behalf of our clients, we reserve the right to disclose any data we collect at our Web site if required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of Responsys’ employees or the general public.<br>
  <br>
  Responsys is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which we link. We encourage our visitors to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit.</p>
