						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                        <p><em>March 1st, 2013</em></p>
                        <p>This Web site is owned and operated by US Interactive Media. We at US Interactive Media (referred to as "US Interactive Media", "we", "us", or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("information") collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "customers", "you", "visitors" or "your"). This privacy statement, effective March 1st, 2013 discloses the privacy practices our collection, use, and disclosure of information.</p>
                        <h2>What Information Do We Collect and Why?</h2>
                        <h4>Personal and Non-Personal Information</h4>
                        <p>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
                        <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) data is collected by us or our Partners, and is used for the purpose of reporting, web traffic, statistics, advertisement ‘click-thru’s,’ online, retargeting and/or other activities on our Web site.  NPII data collected by our Partners is for advertising purposes and is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect’s IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertisers’ and Partners’ websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. We or our Partners may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies for the purposes stated above. </p>
                        <h3>Cookies &amp; Anonymous User Information</h3>
                        <p>We use a feature of Internet web browsers called "cookies". Cookies are generated by web servers and stored on your hard drive when you visit practically any Web site on the Internet. Cookies enable us to "remember" who you are, to store your user preferences to track user trends and search patterns in general. We or our partners use cookies to improve the quality of the information, reporting, web traffic, statistics, advertisement ‘click-thru’s,’ online, retargeting and/or other activities on our Web site. </p>
                        <p>We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve individual personally identifiable information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus.
                        You can adjust your web browser security settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features or services we offer at this Web site may not function properly.</p>
                        <p>We collect anonymous information about all of our Web site visitors each time they visit our Web site so that we can understand how people are using the Web site and so that we can improve upon the overall quality of our visitors' online experience. We record the date and time of your visit, the page you visited, your IP address, the Internet service provider you are using, referral data, the type of browser you are using and the type of operating system you are using. You do not have to register with us before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. We do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address in order for you to use our Web site. We analyze information we collect about our visitors to examine trends, administer the site and to track our visitors' paths through the Web site.</p>
                        <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                        <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
                        <h3>Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses</h3>
                        <p>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the Internet. Technically speaking, your IP address could be used to reveal or be associated with your true identity. However, by law we do not have access to that information.</p>
                        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                        <p>We only collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) that you provide to us when you request information about a product or service. Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from Partners and clients, and to learn about various opportunities. These information request sites require users to provide us with contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, gender, age, work experience, etc.) as well as information specific to the product or service. We collect this information that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. Information you provide to us is used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from one of our partners or clients. Partners and clients have different methods of following up with your information requests based on the information you have provided. Methods of contact include but are not limited to mail, email, telephone and text messages. By using our service to request information from partners or clients, you are giving permission to our partners and clients (or their partners or vendors) to contact you using the method of their choice to meet your request for information notwithstanding any regulations or laws prohibiting specific methods.</p>
                        <h3>Updating your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                        <p>Please note that users cannot update previously submitted information. If your information (such as your email address) should change, we ask that you re-submit a registration form or request.  </p>
                        <p>We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products and services that may be of interest to you. If you have signed up to receive our emails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this Web site, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing email you receive from this Web site.</p>
                        <h4>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h4>
                        <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal information to third parties in ways that are not disclosed in the privacy statement. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to Opt-Out beforehand.</p>
                        <h3>Information Security</h3>
                        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. Passwords are stored in encrypted format for increased security. Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security. While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personal information dramatically reduces the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
