                        <p>This Web site, <a href="http://www.responsivehealth.com" target="_self">http://www.responsivehealth.com</a>&nbsp; is owned and operated by US Interactive Media. We at US Interactive Media (referred to as "US Interactive Media", "we", "us", or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("information") collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "customers", "you", "visitors" or "your"). This privacy policy, effective November 27th, 2013 discloses the privacy practices our collection, use, and disclosure of information.</p>
                        <h2>What Information Do We Collect and Why?</h2>
                        <h4>Personal and Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
                        <p>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
                        <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by us or our Partners, and is used for the purpose of reporting, web traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-thru's, online, retargeting and/or other activities on our Web site. NPII data collected by our Partners is for advertising purposes and is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect's IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertisers' and Partners' websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. We or our Partners may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies for the purposes stated above.</p>
                        <h3>Cookies &amp; Anonymous User Information</h3>
                        <p>We use a feature of Internet web browsers called "cookies".

                        <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                        <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.

                        <h3>Flash LSOs</h3>
                        <p>We use local storage objects (LSOs) to store content information and preferences [or – other uses].</p>
                        <p>Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use LSOs to collect and store information.</p>

                        <h2>With Whom Do We Share Information and What Do We Share?</h2>
                        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                        <p>We only collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") that you provide to us when you request information about a particular product or service. Our websites provide users the opportunity to request information from Partners and clients, and to learn about various opportunities. These information request sites require users to provide us with contact information (name, address, phone number, email address, gender, age, work experience, etc.) as well as information specific to the product or service. We collect this information that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. Information you provide to us is used for marketing purposes, and may result in follow-up communications from one of our partners or clients. Partners and clients have different methods of following up with your information requests based on the information you have provided. Methods of contact include but are not limited to mail, email, telephone and text messages. By using our service to request information from partners or clients, you are giving permission to our partners and clients (or their partners or vendors) to contact you using the method of their choice to meet your request for information notwithstanding any regulations or laws prohibiting specific methods.</p>
                        <h3>Updating your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
                        <p>Please note that users cannot update previously submitted information. If your information (such as your email address) should change, we ask that you re-submit a registration form or request.</p>
                        <p>We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products and services that may be of interest to you.

                        <h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
                        <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or release your personally identifiable information to third parties in ways that are not disclosed in the privacy policy. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to Opt-Out beforehand.</p>
                        <p>We may provide your personally identifiable information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
                        <p>Legal Disclaimer</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>We may also disclose your personally identifiable information:</li>
                        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process </li>
                        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
                        <li>if US Interactive Media is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information,&nbsp; </li>
                        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li></ul><br>
                        <h3>Information Security</h3>
                        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. Passwords are stored in encrypted format for increased security. When you enter your personally identifiable information on our Information Request Form, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security. While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personally identifiable information dramatically reduces the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
