        the Site. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted. It is
        your responsibility to review the Site and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn
        of any modifications. Your continued use of the Site, or any product or service

    </dd>
    <dt>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            We collect two types of information about our Site Users: Personally Identifiable
            Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>Personally Identifiable Information
            is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities
            on or off the Website, such as creating an account, signing in to your account,
            ordering a product or service from us or our partners, adding items to your shopping
            cart, submitting content and/or posting User Content, entering a contest or sweepstakes
            sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending
            us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting
            an affiliate agreement, applying for a job or to be a consultant or supplier, posting
            a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website
            (collectively, "Identification Activities"), we may ask you to provide certain information
            about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity.
            If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to
            provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first
            and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number,
            date of birth and Restaurant.com account information. When you order products or
            services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration
            date and authentication codes or related information. We may also know your location
            if you access the Site. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask
            you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If
            you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires
            it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity
        </p>
        <p>
            We may collect, use and store Personally Identifiable Information, including credit
            card information, to provide products and services to you, make the log-in and checkout
            process easier, administer our Rewards Program, sweepstakes and contests, help you
            track your past purchases and orders, enhance the operation of the Site, improve
            our marketing and promotional efforts to your tastes and location, customize future
            shopping interests, analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings,
            and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy
            Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you provide User Content, such as an email to our customer service or response
            to a restaurant survey, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about
            our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website.
            In connection with such User Content and our Rewards Program, we may also display
            partial information such as first name, initial of last name, city and state. Such
            partial information is not considered Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        <p>
            In addition, if you use our Site to send information or a product to another person,
            we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient.
            We may use that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and
            accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested
            we send. As another example, if you put items in your shopping cart, we may save
            the items you have selected to make your checkout process easier in the future,
            or to remind you about the items you may have forgotten. We may also use Personally
            Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative
            tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of
            Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law
            enforcement activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable
            Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type
            of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the
            website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit
            after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol
            ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers,
            may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the
            use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described
            in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website,
            analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and
            cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with
            our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall
            effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming..</p>

    <dt>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except
            as provided below:</p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Restaurants.</strong> We provide
            some products or services jointly with particular restaurants. These are known as
            "Affiliated Restaurants." We share some of your Personally Identifiable Information
            with Affiliated Restaurants in order to help them provide you with better service
            and track the value of our program. Sharing this Information will allow an Affiliated
            Restaurant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will
            only share Personally Identifiable Information with an Affiliated Restaurant if
            you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the Affiliated Restaurant
            involved in that Identification Activity. For example, if you purchase a promotional
            certificate for a particular restaurant, we may share your name, email address and
            city with that restaurant. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Restaurant if you choose to make an online reservation using
            our Website. The Affiliated Restaurant needs this information to complete the reservation
            and it may contact you regarding the reservation.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Businesses.</strong> We provide
            some products or services jointly with other retail merchants who offer discounts
            through us and donation opportunities through charitable organizations. These are
            known as "Affiliated Businesses." We may share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Business so they can contact you regarding a transaction. Sharing
            this Information will allow an Affiliated Business to market directly to you should
            they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Business if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then
            only to the Affiliated Business involved in that Identification Activity. For example,
            if you purchase a promotional certificate or voucher for a particular retail merchant,
            we may share your name, email address and city with that merchant.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Marketing Partners.</strong> From time
            to time we may establish a business relationship with third parties. These are known
            as our "Marketing Partners." We may share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with our Marketing Partners to enable them to contact you regarding products, services,
            and special offers that may be of interest to you. Some Marketing Partners may contact
            you from a promotional space on our Website, and others may contact you via email.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong>
            We provide some of our services and products through third parties. These "Third
            Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing
            our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable
            Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send
            postal or email, administer our Rewards Program contests or sweepstakes, remove
            repetitive information and improve information on customer lists and databases,
            analyze data and activities, provide marketing assistance, provide search results
            and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and
            provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals
            and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may have
            to also share their information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
            tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information
            to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,
            release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we
            may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage Affiliated Restaurants, Affiliated Businesses, Marketing Partners and
            Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use
            of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy
            policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As with any
            other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this
            occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including
            Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information
            would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
            We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We
            may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is
            appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy
            Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property
            or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>

    <dt>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners,
            Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
            (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party
            Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided
            below:</p>
        <p>
            We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
            These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits
            to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags,
            advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of
            these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are members
            of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). If you would like more information
            about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising
            from any NAI member company, click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a></p>
        <p>
            We also use Third Party Service Providers, like Omniture, to track and analyze Non-Personally
            Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
            our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
            for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
            note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries
            of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned
            and used by us. If you would like more information about this policy, including
            how to opt out, please visit: <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">

    <dd>
        <p>
            We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
            Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information
            by: (1) updating your account at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp?pgn=x" target="_blank">
                                                 http://www.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                                                                                                                                emailing us</a>; or (3) writing to us at the address below. Please indicate
            your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update
            when you contact us.</p>
        <p>
            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if
            it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
            however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
            associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible
            for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
            information.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
            may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>
        <p>
            As a condition of account registration, we require your permission to send you Administrative
            and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity
            and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You
            cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User’s
            activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account,
            requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative
            Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
            Emails update you about new services available on our Site, and advertise our products
            and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, our Rewards Program and/or
            the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. We send Promotional
            Emails to Users who register with us and have not opted-out of receiving Promotional
            Emails. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect
            to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by (1)
            adjusting your account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                                                      http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                                                                                                               emailing us</a>; (3) writing to us at the address found below, or (4) hitting
            the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our promotional emails. When contacting
            us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails
            you do not want to receive. For SMS Text Messaging, reply “Stop” and we will remove
            you from receiving SMS Text Alerts. Please note that this paragraph applies to Promotional
            Emails only if another agreement (like an Incentive or Loyalty Solution ("ILS")
            Division agreement or Affiliate agreement) does not supersede this term of the policy.
            If you received a promotional certificate through our ILS division, please either
            <a href="mailto:corpsalesinfo@restaurant.com">contact us</a> or contact the company
            that gave you the certificate to determine if our Promotional Email Policy applies
            to you.</p>
        <p>
            You also have a choice with respect to the sharing of your Personally Identifiable
            Information with Affiliated Businesses and Marketing Partners for direct marketing
            purposes (but not with Affiliated Businesses for transaction-related purposes, Affiliated
            Restaurants, or Third Party Service Providers). As described above, if we share
            your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliated Business or Marketing Partners,
            such companies may contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest
            to you. If you do not want us to share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners for direct marketing purposes,
            you may elect to opt-out of such information sharing after you sign up as a registered
            User by (1) adjusting your account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                                                                  http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;</a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">

            us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what information you
            do not want us to share with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners. Please
            note that because email addresses and names are one mechanism used by Affiliated
            Restaurants to track the success of our service, we must share your name and address
            with an Affiliated Restaurant when you purchase or redeem a promotional certificate
            to that particular Affiliated Restaurant. If you receive unwanted communication
            from an Affiliated Restaurant, contact such Affiliated Restaurant directly to address
            such communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that opting out of our Promotional Emails or information sharing as
            described above will only affect future communications from us. This means, for
            example, that while we will promptly stop sharing such information once we receive
            your opt-out request, if we shared your information with an Affiliated Business
            or Marketing Partner before your request, you must contact such Marketing Partner
            or Affiliated Business to directly opt-out of its communications.</p>
        <p>
            If you are a restaurant, merchant or other business partner, including a Double
            Deals business or charitable organization and you provided us with your email address,
            you will receive service-oriented Partner Emails from us regarding your account.
            You have the choice of whether you would like to receive these emails. If you do
            not wish to receive account updates, you can opt-out by (1) <a href="mailto:partnersupport@restaurant.com">
                                                                            emailing us</a>; (2) writing to us at the address found below; or (3) hitting
            the unsubscribe button at the bottom of an account email. If you wish not to receive
            our customer promotional emails, you must opt-in to those emails on our consumer
            Website. Please note that opting-out (once you have opted-in) of Promotional Emails
            will not result in your opting out of Partner Emails and vice versa.

    <dd>
        <p>
            We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security
            of Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable
            Information on our Website through a password and unique User ID selected by you,
            or, for restaurant partners, by us. This password is encrypted. We recommend that
            you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable
            Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors
            have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer
            (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe
            as it is transmitted to us.</p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can
            be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable
            security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the
            same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from
            the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may
            receive any such information.</p>

            <strong>Cookies.</strong> To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website,
            we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored
            on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about
            that User. We use cookies and other browser analytics tools to save you time while
            using the Website, remind us who you are, administer our Rewards Program and track
            and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies and
            web analytics tools also allow us to collect information about your experience,
            like which pages you visited, what links you clicked on, and, when combined with
            information you provide to us, we may be able to tell what kind of items you may
            be interested in to make your experience more enjoyable. Use of this information
            helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition,
            we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website.
            As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have
            no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser.
            Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser
            settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies,
            some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>

            <strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We may use other industry standard technologies
            like pixel tags, web beacons and other tools to track your use of our Website pages
            and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices
            on our behalf. These tools are software code that allows us to determine what pages
            you visit, whether you have performed a specific action, etc. When you access these
            pages or open or click an email, these tools generate a notice of that action. These
            tools allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior
            on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance.
            We may also utilize pixel tags, web beacons and other tools provided by our Affiliates
            and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>
