            to a restaurant survey, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about
            our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website.
            In connection with such User Content and our Rewards Program, we may also display

            In addition, if you use our Site to send information or a product to another person,
            we may store your personal information, and the personal information of any recipient.
            We may use that other person’s contact information to allow him or her to view and
            accept your gift or to allow the recipient to access the information you requested
            we send. As another example, if you put items in your shopping cart, we may save
            the items you have selected to make your checkout process easier in the future,
            or to remind you about the items you may have forgotten. We may also use Personally

            <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable
            Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type
            of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the

            We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except
            as provided below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Restaurants.</strong> We provide
            some products or services jointly with particular restaurants. These are known as
            "Affiliated Restaurants." We share some of your Personally Identifiable Information
            with Affiliated Restaurants in order to help them provide you with better service
            and track the value of our program. Sharing this Information will allow an Affiliated
            Restaurant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. However, we will
            only share Personally Identifiable Information with an Affiliated Restaurant if
            you engage in an Identification Activity, and then only to the Affiliated Restaurant
            involved in that Identification Activity. For example, if you purchase a promotional
            certificate for a particular restaurant, we may share your name, email address and
            city with that restaurant. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Restaurant if you choose to make an online reservation using
            our Website. The Affiliated Restaurant needs this information to complete the reservation
            and it may contact you regarding the reservation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Affiliated Businesses.</strong> We provide
            some products or services jointly with other retail merchants who offer discounts
            through us and donation opportunities through charitable organizations. These are
            known as "Affiliated Businesses." We may share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Business so they can contact you regarding a transaction. Sharing
            this Information will allow an Affiliated Business to market directly to you should
            they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifiable Information
            with an Affiliated Business if you engage in an Identification Activity, and then
            only to the Affiliated Business involved in that Identification Activity. For example,
            if you purchase a promotional certificate or voucher for a particular retail merchant,
            we may share your name, email address and city with that merchant.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Marketing Partners.</strong> From time
            to time we may establish a business relationship with third parties. These are known
            as our "Marketing Partners." We may share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with our Marketing Partners to enable them to contact you regarding products, services,
            and special offers that may be of interest to you. Some Marketing Partners may contact
            you from a promotional space on our Website, and others may contact you via email.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong>
            We provide some of our services and products through third parties. These "Third
            Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing
            our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable
            Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send
            postal or email, administer our Rewards Program contests or sweepstakes, remove
            repetitive information and improve information on customer lists and databases,
            analyze data and activities, provide marketing assistance, provide search results
            and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and
            provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals
            and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may have
            to also share their information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative
            tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information
            to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable,
            release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we
            may release an Affiliate’s information to our bank to send out a payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We encourage Affiliated Restaurants, Affiliated Businesses, Marketing Partners and
            Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use
            of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy
            policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As with any
            other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this
            occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including
            Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information
            would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We
            may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information when we believe release is
            appropriate to comply with the law or a court order; enforce or apply this Privacy
            Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property
            or safety of the Website, its Users or others.

        <p>
            We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners,
            Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information
            (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "Third Party
            Advertisers" or "Third Party Advertising Companies" and other parties as provided
            below:
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.
            These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits
            to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags,
            advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of
            these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are members
            of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). If you would like more information
            about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising

            We also use Third Party Service Providers, like Omniture, to track and analyze Non-Personally
            Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer
            our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information
            for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please
            note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries
            of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned

        <p>
            We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable
            Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information
            by: (1) updating your account at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp?pgn=x" target="_blank">
                http://www.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/my-home.asp

            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if
            it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
            however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information
            associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible
            for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup
            information.

    <dt>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it
            may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a condition of account registration, we require your permission to send you Administrative
            and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity
            and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You
            cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User’s
            activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User’s account,
            requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative
            Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional
            Emails update you about new services available on our Site, and advertise our products
            and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, our Rewards Program and/or
            the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. We send Promotional
            Emails to Users who register with us and have not opted-out of receiving Promotional
            Emails. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect
            to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by (1)
            adjusting your account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;
            </a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                emailing us
            </a>; (3) writing to us at the address found below, or (4) hitting
            the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our promotional emails. When contacting
            us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails
            you do not want to receive. For SMS Text Messaging, reply “Stop” and we will remove
            you from receiving SMS Text Alerts. Please note that this paragraph applies to Promotional
            Emails only if another agreement (like an Incentive or Loyalty Solution ("ILS")
            Division agreement or Affiliate agreement) does not supersede this term of the policy.
            If you received a promotional certificate through our ILS division, please either
            <a href="mailto:corpsalesinfo@restaurant.com">contact us</a> or contact the company
            that gave you the certificate to determine if our Promotional Email Policy applies
            to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also have a choice with respect to the sharing of your Personally Identifiable
            Information with Affiliated Businesses and Marketing Partners for direct marketing
            purposes (but not with Affiliated Businesses for transaction-related purposes, Affiliated
            Restaurants, or Third Party Service Providers). As described above, if we share
            your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliated Business or Marketing Partners,
            such companies may contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest
            to you. If you do not want us to share your Personally Identifiable Information
            with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners for direct marketing purposes,
            you may elect to opt-out of such information sharing after you sign up as a registered
            User by (1) adjusting your account preferences at <a href="http://www2.restaurant.com/accountmanager/account/login/">
                http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp;
            </a> (2) <a href="mailto:info@restaurant.com">
                emailing us

            us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what information you
            do not want us to share with Affiliated Businesses or Marketing Partners. Please
            note that because email addresses and names are one mechanism used by Affiliated
            Restaurants to track the success of our service, we must share your name and address
            with an Affiliated Restaurant when you purchase or redeem a promotional certificate
            to that particular Affiliated Restaurant. If you receive unwanted communication
            from an Affiliated Restaurant, contact such Affiliated Restaurant directly to address
            such communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that opting out of our Promotional Emails or information sharing as
            described above will only affect future communications from us. This means, for
            example, that while we will promptly stop sharing such information once we receive
            your opt-out request, if we shared your information with an Affiliated Business
            or Marketing Partner before your request, you must contact such Marketing Partner
            or Affiliated Business to directly opt-out of its communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a restaurant, merchant or other business partner, including a Double
            Deals business or charitable organization and you provided us with your email address,
            you will receive service-oriented Partner Emails from us regarding your account.
            You have the choice of whether you would like to receive these emails. If you do
            not wish to receive account updates, you can opt-out by (1) <a href="mailto:partnersupport@restaurant.com">
                emailing us
            </a>; (2) writing to us at the address found below; or (3) hitting
            the unsubscribe button at the bottom of an account email. If you wish not to receive
            our customer promotional emails, you must opt-in to those emails on our consumer
            Website. Please note that opting-out (once you have opted-in) of Promotional Emails
            will not result in your opting out of Partner Emails and vice versa.

            like pixel tags, web beacons and other tools to track your use of our Website pages
            and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices

            <strong>Notice of Privacy Rights to California Residents.</strong> California law
            requires that we provide you with a summary of your privacy rights under the California
            Online Privacy Protection Act (the "Act") and the California Business and Professions
            Code. As required by the Act, we will provide you with the categories of Personally
            Identifiable Information that we collect through the Website and the categories
            of third party persons or entities with whom such Personally Identifiable Information
            may be shared for direct marketing purposes at your request. We do not enable third
            parties to collect Personally Identifiable Information from the use of our Website for
            their own purposes (except through an Identification Activity) whether over time, across
            third party websites, or other online services. We do not respond to associated "do not
            track" mechanisms. California law requires us to inform you, at your request, (1) the
            categories of Personally Identifiable Information we collect and what third parties we
            share that information with; (2) the names and addresses of those third parties;
            and (3) examples of the products marketed by those companies. The Act further requires
            us to allow you to control who you do not want us to share that information with. To
            obtain this information, please send a request by email or standard mail to the address
            found below. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and
            what Personally Identifiable Information you do not want us to share with Affiliated Businesses
            or Marketing Partners. The request should be sent to the attention of our legal
            department, and labeled "California Customer Choice Notice." Please allow 30 days
            for a response. Also, please note that there is no charge for controlling the sharing
            of your Personally Identifiable Information or requesting this notice.
