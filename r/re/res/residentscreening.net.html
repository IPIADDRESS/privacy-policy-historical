				<p class="body"> We are committed to and maintain the following Privacy Values
				  and Practices regarding the information we collect, maintain, disclose,
				  and
					disseminate about consumers.</p>
				
				<p class="subheadDGr">CoreLogic SafeRent Privacy Values</p>

				<p class="body"><strong>Fairness</strong></p>

				<p class="body">

CoreLogic SafeRent constantly considers consumers' expectations about their 
					 privacy in our business practices.  Using the 
					 <a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</a> 
					 as our guide, we constantly strive to maintain a balance between serving 
					 our clients, maintaining privacy, and ensuring accuracy of information.</p>
				
					<p class="body"><strong>Public Record</strong></p>

				<p class="body">CoreLogic SafeRent believes that an open public record
				  is of significant value  to society, enhances consumer choice,
				  and ultimately creates consumer 
					 opportunity.  We support an open public record and recognize
				  its importance to the economy,
				  to society, and to the safety of the general public.</p>

					<p class="body"><strong>Use</strong></p>

				<p class="body">We believe that we should behave responsibly when we use
				  information about a consumer. 

CoreLogic SafeRent's process
				  of collecting, disseminating and
					disclosing information is designed to comply with all applicable
				  federal, state, and local statutory requirements, governing
				  the use of consumer data, including
					those found in the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">FCRA</a>.  
					Furthermore, any consumer information that is distributed
					to our clients is done   with a commitment, under the terms
					and conditions of the 

CoreLogic SafeRent
					Screening Service Agreement, that each client will handle
					all consumer  information provided to them in an appropriate,
					secure, and	confidential manner.</p>
					
					<p class="body"><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

				<p class="body">CoreLogic SafeRent takes reasonable steps to help ensure
				  the accuracy of the data  we collect, use and disseminate.
				  Where possible, we take reasonable steps  to investigate 
					claims of inaccurate or incomplete data we collect, use,
				  and disseminate,  and if appropriate, correct inaccurate
				  information that we maintain using the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">FCRA</a> 
					as our guide. In cases where we receive inquiries about information
					we do	not	maintain	and	manage,
					we take	reasonable steps	to refer	the consumer	to
					the source	of the data which they believe to be erroneous.</p>
					
					
					<p class="body"><strong>Education</strong>
				</p><p class="body">CoreLogic SafeRent endeavors to educate employees, clients, and others in the 
					multifamily housing industry about the importance of consumer privacy.  It is our 
					goal to ensure consumers are informed as to how CoreLogic SafeRent, and our 
					clients, use the consumer information we maintain, manage and disseminate. We 
					also encourage all parties, with whom we conduct business, to collect and use 
					information in a responsible manner. We are open with consumers about the 
					various types of information we maintain and will also discuss with a consumer 
					the source of that information.</p>
					
					
					<p class="body"><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong>

				</p><p class="body">We  strive to ensure utilization of appropriate facilities
				  and systems to protect against unauthorized access to or corruption
				  of the data we collect, maintain
					and disseminate.  We use various identity verification methods
				  to determine the accurate identity of a consumer making a request.
				  We employ security
					procedures for handling consumer information as well as maintaining
				  physical security and limiting access to our facilities in
				  order to safeguard information we collect, maintain, and disseminate.</p>
					
					
				<p class="subheadDGr">CoreLogic SafeRent Privacy Practices</p>
				
					<p class="body"><strong>Applicability</strong></p>

				<p class="body">CoreLogic SafeRent is committed to safeguarding consumer
				  information. As a consumer using this site you may provide CoreLogic
				  SafeRent with certain contact
					information such as, your name, phone number(s), address,
				  or email address. We understand that you may be concerned about the information
				  you provide and
					have a right to know how we utilize this information. We
				  generally use consumer inquiry information for the purpose of expediting
				  our response to your request.</p>
					
					
				<p class="body"><strong>Types of Information</strong>


				</p><p class="body">The types 
					of information we may collect include, but are not limited
				  to:</p>
						<ul class="bodybullet">
							<li>Information we receive from you either verbally or in writing</li> 
							<li>Information you disclose on a form</li> 
							<li>Any communication in writing, by telephone or by e-mail</li> 
							<li>Any previous consumer dispute or request you may have initiated</li>
							<li>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency</li>
							<li>Information we receive from public records</li>
							<li>Information provided by a law enforcement agency or government entity</li>
							<li>Information provided by a previous landlord or property manager</li>
						</ul>
				<p class="body"><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>

				<p class="body">Our 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/contact_cr/index.php">Consumer Relations Department</a> 
					may request information from you in an effort to resolve
					your question or concern with 	information maintained in
					your 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#consumerfile">consumer file</a> 
					and only does so for legitimate business purposes. We do
					not release your information  to any party other than to
					a client making	an inquiry with your approval as permitted
						by laws set forth under the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">Fair Credit Reporting
					Act (FCRA)</a>. 
					We may use any information received from a consumer 
					to update the accuracy of the information we maintain. CoreLogic SafeRent holds its clients to standards
					established	by the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">FCRA</a> 
					and other applicable laws.  We reinforce our standards through
					screening  agreements we have in place with our clients that
					state our products	
					and services are only intended for permissible purposes established
					under the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">FCRA</a>. 
					If we believe that a client is using CoreLogic SafeRent's
					information in a  manner that does not comply with applicable
					laws or agreements	we will pursue 
					corrective action.  We periodically review the use of 
					information by our clients to ensure appropriateness of use
					of information 	we provide.
					
				</p><p class="body"><strong>Security</strong></p>

				<p class="body">We constantly strive to ensure appropriate utilization of
				  facilities, systems and procedures to protect against unauthorized
				  access to or corruption of the data we collect,
					maintain and disseminate.  We restrict access to nonpublic
				  personal information about consumers to only authorized personnel
				  and/or clients which have
					permissible purpose to access such information. We use reasonable,
				  necessary identity verification protocols to properly identify
				  a consumer making a request.
					We employ security procedures for handling consumer information
				  as well as maintaining physical security of our facilities
					in order to safeguard information we collect, maintain, and
				  disseminate. As stated we use various means to verfiy the identity
				  of an individual making a request or inquiry. Consumer Relations
				  uses the information
				  you provide
					to us, in conjunction with the information we have collected,
				  for the purpose of resolving your consumer relations issue
				  or concern. We may also use the
					information you provide to update the accuracy of information
				  we maintain.</p>
				  
				  
				<p class="body"><strong>Special Message for Connecticut Residents Regarding the Confidentiality of Social Security Numbers.</strong></p>

				<p class="body">Connecticut's legislature passed Public Act 08-167 requiring that consumer reporting agencies, like CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc., display to Connecticut residents how CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. protects the confidentiality of social security numbers; prohibits the unlawful disclosure of social security numbers; and, limits access to social security numbers. CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. takes the same protective measures described above with regard to other nonpublic personal information when handling a social security number and, generally, also does the following in addition:  CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. does not release the full social security number in reports produced from its own databases, even when a consumer has requested a copy of his/her own report.  A description of our basic security for nonpublic personal information is described above and applies to the social security number.</p>
				  
					
				<p class="subheadDGr">Questions about CoreLogic SafeRent Privacy Values and Practices</p>
				
				<p class="body"><strong>What information is collected and tracked from the
				  use of this website/webpage?</strong> </p>

				<p class="body">We may use information provided by a consumer for the purpose
				  of expediting our  response to your request and updating the
				  accuracy of information in your 
					consumer file. Once we confirm a consumer's 
					identity, we may then incorporate correspondence, forms,
				  and requests with the  consumer's dispute/reinvestigation file.
				  The majority of information used or 
					tracked originating from this consumer website is information
				  you provide to us. Consumer information we provide to our clients
				  is primarily obtained from housing and criminal public court records as
				  well as the
				  major national credit bureaus 
					such as: 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/credit_bureaus/index.php">Experian</a>, 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/credit_bureaus/index.php">TransUnion</a> 
					and <a href="/consumer_relations/credit_bureaus/index.php">Equifax</a>.
					Our objective is to provide our clients with timely accurate consumer information
					so that they may make an informed business decision based
					on 
					their own criteria.</p>

				<p class="body"><strong>Do we share information with third parties?</strong></p>

				<p class="body">Our process of collecting and disclosing information is designed 
					to comply with applicable federal, state, and local statutory requirements, 
					governing the use of consumer data, including those found in the 
					<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra">FCRA</a>.  
					Any personal information can be used by 
					our Consumer Relations Department when addressing or reinvestigating
					a consumer-initiated issue or concern. There are several scenarios in which
					we may provide information in your consumer file to a third party: </p>
					
						<ol type="1" class="bodybullet">
							<li>Upon your authorization, we supply our clients (potential employers 
							or property managers/agents) with a <a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#consumerreport">consumer report</a>. 
							Information about consumers is distributed to our clients with a 
							commitment from each client that the information will be handled in a 
							secure and confidential manner.   We may provide information about

									permission to request a report.</li>
									<li>Potential employers with whom a consumer has granted permission 
									to conduct a background check.</li>
									<li>State and federal government entities as permitted by applicable laws.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Third parties may be authorized to receive information when handling 
							a consumer request or dispute when a consumer signs the Third Party Disclosure portion of the 
							<a href="/consumer_relations/forms/consumer_disclosure_packet.pdf" target="_blank">Consumer Disclosure Request Form</a>.</li>    
							<li>For permissible purpose  under the FCRA and other applicable laws,
							  we may provide information in your 
							<a href="/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#consumerfile">consumer
							file</a> 
							to our clients and/or law enforcement and government
							agencies.</li>
						</ol>	  
				        <p class="body">We do not use consumer information without prior authorization for marketing purposes 
							nor do we sell the information to organizations or agencies to use the information 
							for marketing or solicitation.</p>
				      <p class="body"><strong>How can I review my CoreLogic SafeRent consumer file or dispute information CoreLogic SafeRent maintains or provides?</strong></p>
