			<p>Reserve Media, Inc. (“Reserve” or “we” or “us”) operates a digital concierge service focused on making the dining experience better, both for restaurants and diners (the “Service”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information when you use, access and interact with our Service, including, without limitation, through our website (the “Site”) or our mobile applications. By using, accessing, or interacting with the Service, you are consenting to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties or individuals that we do not own, control, manage or employ, including, but not limited to, restaurants in the Reserve network (each, a “Restaurant”) or any other third party websites, services, or applications that you chose to access or use through the Service or that you chose to use to interact with the Service. Some examples of such third parties are provided throughout this Privacy Policy, but please note that the examples included herein are not meant to be an exhaustive list.

			<p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>

			<p>To sign up for the Service, you must create an account and provide certain required information, including: your name, email, zip code, mobile phone number, password, and your credit and/or debit card information (please note that we do not store your credit or debit card information, as further described in the section called “Information Shared With Our Third Party Payment Processor”). You may also choose to upload a photo to your account and may have the option of adding notes to your account that you would like to provide to Restaurants when requesting a reservation, such as any dietary restrictions or food preferences you may have. </p>

			<p>By signing up for the Service, you acknowledge that some of the account information we ask for and collect (collectively, “Account Information”) may be Personal Information and that by providing Personal Information to us you are allowing us and others (as described in this Privacy Policy) to use that Personal Information, including for the purpose of identifying you. </p>

			<p><strong>Usage Information</strong></p>

			<p>We may also use a variety of technologies to passively collect other information as you use or interact with the Service (“Usage Information”). For example, Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Site, all of the areas within our Site that you visit, access times, precise location data, and your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile phone or other device used to access the Service (each, a “Device”).

			<p>A few methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following (and may include technologies and methods developed hereafter):</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> When you visit our Site we may send one or more cookies to your Device. A cookie is a data file that is used for various purposes, including, among other things, to identify your browser, remember you and your preferences, and track your visits to our Site. A cookie does not collect Personal Information about you. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>

			<li><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We may employ small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) in our Site and email messages, which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users and to track which emails are opened by recipients.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device.  Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. To learn more about cookies, web beacons and related technologies and how you may opt-out of some of this tracking, you may wish to visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org.  Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at <a href="mailto:support@reserve.com">support@reserve.com</a>.</p>

			<p>We currently do not employ technology that recognizes “Do Not Track” signals from your browser. </p>

			<p><strong>Third Party Platform Information</strong></p>

			<p>We may also obtain information about you from other sources, including but not limited to third party websites, applications, and services (each, a “Third Party Platform”), through which you connect with or use to interact with our Service and we may combine that with information we collect.

We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policies of such Third Party Platforms should you have any questions.</p>

			<p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

			<p>Our primary goal in collecting the types of information described above is to allow us to provide and improve upon the Service and to offer you an enhanced and personalized experience when using the Service. </p>

			<p>For example, we may use Account Information and Request Information to:</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>Request, confirm, change or cancel reservations on your behalf at Restaurants you’ve selected through the Service;</li>

			<li>Send you information about requested, confirmed, changed, completed or cancelled reservations at a Restaurant you’ve selected through the Service, including receipts;</li>

			<li>Authenticate your credit or debit card account information; and</li>

			</ol>

			<p>By way of further example, we may use Usage Information to: (a) store certain information so that you will not have to re-enter that information when you visit the Site or use the Service; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our Service and marketing efforts; (c) monitor aggregate metrics, such as total number of visitors and traffic patterns; (d) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; (e) help you efficiently access you information after you sign up; and (g) automatically update the Reserve application on your Devices.</p>
