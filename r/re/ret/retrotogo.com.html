<p style="text-align: left;">Like the majority of websites in the world, this one uses cookies – small text files stored on your computer by your browser, which help us to develop the site by checking traffic on the websites we run, support affiliate programs or post ads that are relevant to site users. They do not include personal information (like your name, for example) and do not damage files.</p>
<p>We may use this information (and share it with third party business partners) to observe your internet use and to compile data in order to improve the site, target advertising to you and assess general effectiveness of such advertising.</p>
<p>If the settings on your browser or software you use to view this website are adjusted to accept cookies we take this, and your continued use of the site, to mean that you are fine with cookie use. If you do not agree with cookies being used, the information below will explain how to stop using cookies and how to opt out of the ones used on our sites.</p>
<p>Note that we take no responsibility with regard to any changes you make to your own computer. It is your own choice if you turn off cookies in your web browser – and your browsing experience across various websites may be diminished.</p>
<p>Any changes to this policy will be posted here. We reserve the right to vary this Cookie Policy from time to time, with changes effective as soon as they are posted.</p>
