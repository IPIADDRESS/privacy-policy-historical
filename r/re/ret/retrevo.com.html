However, some Retrevo features and services may not function properly if you disable cookies in your browser.</li>
<li>Log information: Your web browser sends some information automatically when you connect to a web server. This information may include the IP address of your computer, date and time of access, type of web browser used, the operating system and other information that uniquely identifies a browser. When you use the Retrevo service, our servers automatically record this information in log files. We also record search terms that you type, web pages you access and other information that may describe your behavior.</li>
<li>Links to other sites: Retrevo web site includes links to other external sites either directly or in response to a search query from you. Retrevo does not exercise control over these external sites. We advise you to review the individual privacy policies of the respective sites.</li>
</ul>
