			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				Hexagram 49, Inc. (“RethinkDB”) operates
				rethinkdb.com. It is RethinkDB’s policy to
				respect your privacy regarding any information
				we may collect while operating our websites.
			</p>

			<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
			<p>
				Like most website operators, RethinkDB
				collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
				that web browsers and servers typically make available, such
				as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
				and the date and time of each visitor request. RethinkDB’s
				purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
				is to better understand how RethinkDB’s visitors use its
				website. From time to time, RethinkDB may release
				non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
				e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
				website.
			</p>

			<p>
				RethinkDB also collects potentially personally-identifying
				information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged
				in users and for users leaving comments on the rethinkdb.com
				blog. RethinkDB only discloses logged in user and
				commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
				uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
				described below.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>
				Certain visitors to RethinkDB’s websites choose to interact with
				RethinkDB in ways that require RethinkDB to gather
				personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
				information that RethinkDB gathers depends on the nature of
				the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
				for a plan at rethinkdb.com to provide a username and email
				address. Those who engage in transactions with RethinkDB –
				by purchasing any RethinkDB plan, for example – 
				are asked to provide additional
				information, including as necessary the personal and
				financial information required to process those
				transactions. In each case, RethinkDB collects such
				information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to
				fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
				RethinkDB. RethinkDB does not disclose
				personally-identifying information other than as described
				below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
				personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
				may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
				activities.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
			<p>
				RethinkDB may collect statistics
				about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For
				instance, RethinkDB may monitor the most popular content on
				the rethinkdb.com site. RethinkDB may display this
				information publicly or provide it to others. However,
				RethinkDB does not disclose personally-identifying
				information other than as described below.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>
				RethinkDB discloses potentially personally-identifying and
				personally-identifying information only to those of its
				employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i)
				need to know that information in order to process it on
				RethinkDB’s behalf or to provide services available at
				RethinkDB’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
				disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
				and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your
				home country; by using RethinkDB’s websites, you consent to
				the transfer of such information to them. RethinkDB will
				not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
				personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to
				its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
				described above, RethinkDB discloses potentially
				personally-identifying and personally-identifying
				information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
				other governmental request, or when RethinkDB believes in
				good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
				protect the property or rights of RethinkDB, third parties
				or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an
				RethinkDB website and have supplied your email address,
				RethinkDB may occasionally send you an email to tell you
				about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
				up to date with what’s going on with RethinkDB and our
				products. We primarily use our various product blogs to
				communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
				this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
				(for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
				mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
				help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
				support other users. RethinkDB takes all measures
				reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
				access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
				personally-identifying and personally-identifying
				information.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				A cookie is a string of information that a website
				stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
				browser provides to the website each time the visitor
				returns. RethinkDB uses cookies to help RethinkDB identify
				and track visitors, their usage of RethinkDB website, and
				their website access preferences. RethinkDB visitors who do
				not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should
				set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
				RethinkDB’s websites, with the drawback that certain
				features of RethinkDB’s websites may not function properly
				without the aid of cookies.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
			<p>
				If RethinkDB, or substantially all of
				its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
				RethinkDB goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
				information would be one of the assets that is transferred
				or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
				transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of RethinkDB may
				continue to use your personal information as set forth in
				this policy.
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
			<p>
				Although most changes are likely to
				be minor, RethinkDB may change its Privacy Policy from time
				to time, and in RethinkDB’s sole discretion. RethinkDB
				encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
				changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site
				after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
				acceptance of such change.
