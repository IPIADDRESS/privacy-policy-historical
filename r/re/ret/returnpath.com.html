   <p><b>Return Path Privacy Policy</b><br>

   </p><p align="center"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

   <p>Return Path offers an e-mail change of address service that helps
      people stay in touch with their family, friends, business
      contacts, web sites and e-mail subscriptions. We know that you're
      concerned with privacy on the Internet, and we've taken many steps

   <p>Return Path is committed to protecting your privacy and to
      ensuring that you are in control of the information that we
      maintain about you. The Return Path privacy policy ("Privacy
      Policy") explains what we will and will not do with your personal
      information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal
      information" means individually identifiable information about a
      user collected online, including a user's first and last name,
      home or other physical address, e-mail address or telephone
      number.</p>

   <p>Returnpath.net is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe

<!-- Use Limitation -->

   <a name="use_limit"></a>
   
   <p align="center"><b><u>Use Limitation</u> </b></p>

   <p>Return Path treats your personal information as confidential and
      does not disclose it or use it except as permitted by you, as
      described in this privacy policy, or as required by law,
      subpoena, court order, legal process or a warrant.</p>

   <p>If we are served with a civil subpoena seeking personal
      information about a Return Path user, we will use reasonable
      efforts to notify the specified user of the request prior to
      disclosure of such personal information, so as to allow the user
      the opportunity to oppose the subpoena.</p>

   <p>Return Path will not provide your e-mail address, name, or other
      personal identifiers to merchants or marketers without your
      prior permission. Return Path will follow the
      instructions you indicate through the Return Path software
      interface or e-mails we send to you.</p>

   <p>Return Path may engage third parties to perform analysis or data
      processing of our databases that involves access to your personal
      information, in order to better provide you with the services for
      which you joined. If Return Path does so, it will ensure that such
      parties are contractually required to keep the information
      confidential and not to use it in any way other than as is
      necessary to perform their work for Return Path.</p>

   <p>Return Path may disclose summary information obtained by combining
      data from many individuals (never fewer than 25, and typically
      thousands or more), but with all personal identifiers
      removed.</p>

   <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<!-- Individual Participation -->

   <a name="ind_part"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Individual Participation</u></b></p>

   <p>As a Return Path member, you have access to, and appropriate
      control over, the data that Return Path maintains about you.</p>

   <p>Return Path gives you easy access to the information maintained
      about you in the Return Path database in a format that is easy to
      understand. Our current policy is to collect your old and new 
		e-mail address from you when you register your e-mail address change
      at the Return Path web site or at a Return Path network partner
      web site. Return Path limits user access to verification of your
      old and new e-mail addresses, and settings for handling E-mail
      Change of Address notifications to personal and commercial
      contacts. Should this access policy change, Return Path will post
      the changed policy on this web site.</p>

   <p>Return Path provides you with options that enable you to determine
      how you want to handle notifications to personal and commercial
      contacts regarding your changed e-mail address. These options let
      you either determine who may receive your new e-mail
      address, or grant Return Path permission to share your new e-mail
      address with anyone who knows your old e-mail address and is a
      Return Path-approved network partner or an individual using the
      service to get back in touch with you. Regardless of the option
      you choose, you decide how your information is shared.</p>

   <p>To revise or edit your personally identifiable information, simply
      go to the Address Manager tab on the Return Path web site. Use your
      new e-mail address as your log-in ID. Return Path, upon
      recognizing your valid Log-in ID will send an e-mail to your new 
		e-mail address, containing the link for access to Address Manager.
      However, a request to revise or edit your personally identifiable
      information may not be accommodated if it would result in
      incorrect information. Requests for deletion of certain key
      information, such as e-mail address, may require closing the
      account.</p>

   <p>Most requests for access to personal data are processed within
      seconds of being made through the Return Path software Web
      interface. Some requests may take up to a few days to process, and
      the results may be delivered by e-mail.</p>

   <p>Any other questions should be addressed to

      <a href="mailto:support@returnpath.net">support@returnpath.net</a>.</p>

   <p>Information about a member may be withheld or exempted from
      deletion if this is required by law or is part of a fraud
      investigation.</p>

   <p><b>Unsubscribe Procedures:</b></p>

   <p>If you decide that you do not wish to participate in our service
      you can unsubscribe by clicking on the link provided in any 
      e-mail message Return Path sends you and following the
      directions provided. Additionally, you can remove your account
      information directly from the Return Path web site by going to the
      Address Manager, after logging in, and clicking the link marked
      "Remove Old addresses".</p>

<!-- Security Safeguards -->

   <a name="security"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Security Safeguards</u></b></p>

   <p>We ensure information quality by employing advanced technology to
      protect our users' data. We also have well-defined employee and
      network partner practices that protect the integrity of and access
      to our users' information.</p>

   <p>At Return Path we employ security techniques and well-defined
      employee practices to ensure that data is protected from
      unauthorized access and use. We hold our employees and network
      partners accountable for maintaining the privacy and integrity of
      our users' information. Return Path provides ongoing training
      programs that are designed to keep our employees and network
      partners informed of our Privacy Policies.</p>

   <p>Return Path may engage employees, contractors, and other companies
      to perform work that involves access to personal information. If
      Return Path does so, it will ensure that such parties are
      contractually required to keep the information confidential and
      not to use it in any way other than as is necessary to perform
      their work for Return Path.</p>

   <p>Return Path works to reduce the likelihood of accidental
      disclosures and unintended access and modification of account
      information, but it is impossible to eliminate this possibility
      completely.</p>

   <p>To access the information Return Path holds about you, use your
      new e-mail address as your log-in ID. Return Path, upon
      recognizing your valid Log-in ID will send an e-mail to your new 
		e-mail address, containing the link for access to Address Manager.
      If you allow others to have access to your new e-mail address box,
      that is--allow them to access and read your e-mail--they may be
      able to gain access to your Return Path account. To maintain the
      highest level of security for your Return Path account, you should
      not provide others with access to your e-mail address box.</p>

   <p>We conduct internal and external audits to determine the
      effectiveness of our compliance with our Privacy Policy. Our
      Return Path-approved network partners are contractually and
      legally obligated to follow agreed-upon privacy practices. If a
      Return Path user feels that they have experienced a violation of
      these privacy policies, they should contact us at:</p>

<!-- Openness -->

   <a name="openness"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Openness</u></b></p>

   <p>Return Path has a general policy of openness about developments,
      practices and policies with respect to personal data. Return Path
      states in detail what personal data it collects and why it
      collects it.</p>

   <p>Return Path's Web server may log key information about any visitor
      to the Return Path web site (both users and non-users), including
      the following elements:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>The URL of the page requested;
      </li><li>The time and date of the request;
      </li><li>The "User Agent" (the make and model of the web browser being
         used, and the version and type of your operating system);
      </li><li>The "Referrer" (the URL where you clicked on a link to Return
         Path's site);
      </li><li>The IP address where a copy of the page you requested is to be
         sent for display by your browser. 
   </li></ul>

   <p>Return Path "anonymizes" its server logs periodically. Return Path
      summarizes each element it tracks, such as User Agent and
      Referrer, the number of visits from higher-level domains, and so
      on. The individual records are destroyed, thus cutting the link
      between a particular IP address and the other server elements
      listed above. Although an IP address does not usually identify the
      visitor personally, it does suggest an individual association in
      some cases, which is one reason why we "anonymize" the logs.</p>

   <p>We use this information in aggregate to get a better picture of
      where our visitors come from and how to plan for our future
      needs.</p>

   <p>The web server logs may be used in the course of a fraud
      investigation.</p>

   <p>The User Agent also is used during your visit to indicate to you
      whether Return Path's software will run on your computer's
      configuration. The URL may contain tracking codes used only for
      the purpose of auditing advertising.</p>

   <p><b>Our Use of Cookies:</b></p>

   <p>At the present time, Return Path will be using cookies to manage
      the session between your browser and our web site. Cookies will
      also be used to allow you to have a unique ID for access to our
      services. We will not collect any personally identifiable
      information via the use of cookies. Any information we collect
      using cookies will be used only for the purposes of web site
      administration and will not be shared with anyone. Should our
      policy change regarding the use of cookies, Return Path will post
      those changes to our privacy policy.</p>

   <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to
      store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that
      browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some
      specific information. An example is when a browser stores your
      passwords and user IDs. They are also used to store preferences of
      start pages. Both Microsoft and Netscape use cookies to create
      personal start pages.</p>

   <p>Cookies are used to make informed guesses about you. They can be
      used to access information about your web activities including
      things like sites you've visited, passwords and purchases you've
      made. Companies can only make guesses about who you are because
      cookies do not necessarily contain personal information about you.
      Cookies alone are not invasive of your privacy and actually
      provide benefits to you. Much of what you find on the web today is
      free because advertising, similar to television and radio,
      supports it. Advertising, in part, is driven by the information
      contained in cookies. Cookies provide an effective way for the web
      sites you visit to personalize your experience when you visit
      them. In fact, many sites actually require that a cookie be
      "dropped" on your computer in order for these sites to recognize
      you and work properly when you visit them.</p>

   <p><b>Our Use of Clear GIF's:</b></p>

   <p>Return Path uses a common technology called a clear gif or action
      tags. A clear gif (graphic interface format) is a small graphic
      image that is a 1x1 pixel placed on our web site, in banner ads,
      and/or in e-mail communications. A clear gif provides us with
      important information about how members use our web site and
      respond to our e-mail communications, such as whether someone is
      using an e-mail reader that understands HTML e-mail messages. This
      information helps us understand the effectiveness of our web-based
      communications and improve it's effectiveness.</p>

<!-- Collection Limitation -->

   <a name="coll_limit"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Collection Limitation</u></b></p>

   <p>Return Path collects personal data about you only in ways that are
      fair and lawful. Return Path collects only the personal data it
      has said it collects, and only in the ways it has said it collects
      it.</p>

   <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<!-- Purpose Specification -->

   <a name="prp_spec"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Purpose Specification</u></b></p>

   <p>Return Path always specifies the purposes for which it uses
      personal data, before collecting it. Return Path will not use it
      for other purposes without first obtaining the member's
      consent.</p>

   <p><b>Who Collects Your Information:</b></p>

   <p>Return Path collects e-mail address change information at our web
      site,

      <a href="http://www.returnpath.net">www.returnpath.net</a>,

      and at network partner web sites with a pop-up window hosted by
      Return Path. Return Path's network partners may also collect
      information from you when you update your e-mail address at their
      web sites, and may then send the information to us if you have
      opted-in to the Return Path e-mail change of address service.</p>

   <p><b>Information We Collect:</b></p>

   <p>When you register your e-mail address change at a Return Path web
      site or at a Return Path network partner web site, we ask you to
      provide your new and old e-mail addresses. When you press
      "submit," Return Path also records the time and date, as well as
      other administrative information that helps Return Path prevent
      people from misusing our system.</p>

   <p>After you submit your e-mail address change, Return Path sends out
      a confirmation e-mail to both your new and old e-mail addresses.
      We do this to help prevent people from misusing our service. Our 
		confirmation e-mails provide instructions on how to activate or 
		cancel your registration.</p>

   <p>In order to protect your online information and prevent misuse of
      our system, Return Path regularly records the time and date you
      opened the confirmation e-mail messages, what links you clicked,
      as well as other information that may help people you choose to
      receive your new e-mail address send messages to you in a format
      that you can receive. </p>

   <p>If you choose to send a greeting card to notify your friends,
      family and business contacts of your e-mail address change, Return
      Path will collect the e-mail addresses of the recipients. Return
      Path will also collect the first names and last names of the
      recipients of the greeting card, as well as a brief, personal
      message if you choose to include such information in the greeting
      card. Return Path will not use the recipients' names or e-mail
      addresses other than to deliver a greeting card (although the
      recipients may be presented with an opportunity to register for
      Return Path's free e-mail change of address service). </p>

   <p>If you are using our service to look for one of our users, we may
      ask you for your first and last name. We use your first and last
      name to identify you to the individual whose e-mail address you
      are asking us to locate for you. When you press "submit," Return
      Path also records the time and date, as well as other
      administrative information that helps Return Path prevent people
      from misusing our system. </p>

   <p>Return Path, when appropriate, sends strictly administrative 
		e-mails regarding material changes in our privacy policy or relating
      to the Return Path service.</p>

   <p>An e-mail address is used as your unique name when you login. You
      are responsible for maintaining control of the e-mail address, as
      personal information may be sent to it.</p>

   <p>Return Path makes other uses of summary information obtained by
      combining data from many individuals (never fewer than 25, and
      typically thousands or more), where the name and other identifiers
      have been removed.</p>

   <p>Any personal information collected during the course of customer
      service (your home phone number, for example) will only be used
      for the purpose of customer service. This information will not be
      linked to your account, nor will it be shared with anyone
      else.</p>

   <p>In the future, Return Path may ask for additional information that
      will help us understand your use of e-mail, your interests and/or
      preferences, so that we may continue to enhance our services to
      best serve you. This information will not be shared with any third
      parties without your explicit permission, and the provision of
      this information is completely at your option.</p>

   <p>If you become a Return Path user, you give us permission to use
      the information we have told you we use here, for the purposes
      stated here, according to the options you indicate via the Return
      Path software and web site.</p>

   <p><b>Information We Share:</b></p>

   <p>Once your e-mail address change has been registered, you decide
      who has access to your updated e-mail address. Individual visitors
      may come to our web site,

      <a href="http://www.returnpath.net">www.returnpath.net</a> and


      or a Return Path network partner's web site, to request your
      updated e-mail address. Return Path's network partners may also
      send us a list of e-mail addresses in an attempt to re-contact
      people whose e-mail addresses may have changed. Return Path 
      provides your new e-mail address to requestors according to the 
		permission option you selected when you registered, and/or how 
		you respond to our notification e-mails. Once we have your permission, 
		your new e-mail address will be provided to the network partner and 
		the network partner's use of the new e-mail address will be covered by
      the network partner's privacy policies. Return Path contractually
      requires each of its network partners to include in its privacy
      policies a provision that provides you with the option to opt-out
      at any time from any e-mail communication subscriptions you have
      with the network partner. If you are unable to opt-out from one of
      our network partner's e-mail subscription lists, please contact us
      at

      <a href="mailto:privacy@returnpath.net">privacy@returnpath.net</a>.</p>

   <p>If you choose to send a greeting card to notify others of your 
		e-mail change of address, Return Path will share your e-mail address
      with the recipients of the greeting card. Return Path will also
      share your first name and/or last name with the recipients of the
      greeting card. Return Path will not use the recipients' names or 
		e-mail addresses other than to deliver a greeting card (although the
      recipients may be presented with an opportunity to register for
      Return Path's free e-mail change of address service).</p>

   <p>Return Path shares additional technical information (for instance:
      whether the e-mail program you use can receive html e-mail)
      collected during the e-mail address change registration process
      with our network partners, in order for our partners to send you 
		e-mail messages in a format (for instance: html or text) that you
      can receive. Return Path also shares aggregate information (for
      instance information gathered from log files like IP address,
      referring urls, and browser type) for research and development
      efforts. However, this information does not contain, nor is it
      tied, to personally identifiable information.</p>

<!-- Data Quality -->

   <a name="data_qual"></a>

   <p align="center"><b><u>Data Quality</u></b></p>

   <p>Return Path does not collect personal data from you that is not
      relevant to the purposes stated in its Privacy Policy. Return Path
      strives to keep all personal information accurate, complete, and
      up-to-date.</p>

   <p>As described in our Terms and Conditions, Return Path may
      terminate your account for various reasons, such as if you ask us
      to or if you stop using it for a long time.</p>

   <p>After a reasonable period of time (consistent with business
      requirements such as accounting), the personal information
      associated with terminated accounts will be destroyed or removed.
      From time to time, Return Path reduces the amount of data
      associated with active members by converting older data into
      summary statistics or destroying it.</p>

   <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <b><u>Policy Regarding Children's Use of Our Site</u></b>
   </p>

   <p>Return Path complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection

<!-- Business Transfers or Bankruptcy -->

   <p align="center"><b><u>Business Transfers or Bankruptcy</u></b></p>

   <p>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
      companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information
      generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the
      unlikely event that Return Path or substantially all of its assets
      are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the
      transferred assets. Return Path users will be notified of such
      business transfer or bankruptcy and be given the opportunity to
      opt-out of any such transfer.</p>

   <p>The foregoing policy is effective as of July 2002. Return Path
      reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check
      this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of Return
      Path's services following the posting of changes to these terms
      will mean you accept those changes. In the event that Return Path
      intends to change this policy, Return Path will post a message on
      the home page of its Web Site that states that the Privacy Policy
      has been changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy.
      These postings will occur on Return Path's Web Site for at least
      30 days prior to any material change.</p>

   <p>If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in
      a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we
      will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether
      or not we use your information in this different manner.  However,
      if you have opted out of all communication with the site, or
      deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted.
      Nor will your personal information be used in this new
