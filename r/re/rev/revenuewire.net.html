         your trust. We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required to do so by law.</p>
         
         <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web         site.</p>
         
         <p>By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to RevenueWire's collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes as outlined herein.</p>
