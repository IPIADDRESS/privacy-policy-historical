Web beacons, pixels or similar  technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including without  limitation, to obtain information such as the URL of the page on which the  beacon appears or the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, to  measure promotion effectiveness through the Services, or to optimize promotion  performance. Pixels and web beacons may also be placed by third parties on the  Services. This privacy policy does not govern the use of such third party pixels  and web beacons.</p>
