<p>Consumer privacy is a top priority. That's why we designed the RevTrax&reg; platform. RevTrax provides advertisers with anti-fraud and other security measures and analytics for promotions. The advertiser, not RevTrax, is responsible for the distribution, content and other terms of the promotions. 
We have answered a few of the most frequently asked questions concerning privacy in plain English. You can also read our full Public Site Privacy Policy below.
</p>

<p>Do I need to provide any personally identifiable information to RevTrax in order to receive a RevTrax enabled coupon?</p>
<p>We will not ask for your personally identifiable information in order for you to obtain or print any coupon unless required to do so by an advertiser or if you request a coupon to be sent to your email or mobile phone. You may also be asked for additional information, such as your friends’ email addresses or mobile numbers, if you opt to participate in a social sharing coupon promotion. </p>
<p>If I print a RevTrax coupon, does RevTrax know who I am?</p>
<p>No. RevTrax does not know who you are unless (i) you tell us, or (ii) a merchant shared your personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address) with RevTrax. </p>
<p>If I print a RevTrax coupon, does the advertiser know who I am?</p>
<p>The advertiser only knows who you are if you concurrently opt in by providing personally identifiable  information in order to receive a promotion or previously opted in to an email list, loyalty club, or other program run by an advertiser or one of its third party vendors and provided them with your personally identifiable information. </p>
<p>Does RevTrax sell personally identifiable data?</p>
<p>RevTrax does not sell personally identifiable data. We do publish trend information (e.g. consumers are more likely to print coupons for shoes than for socks) but this is based on aggregated, non-identifiable data.</p>
<p>Does RevTrax track my browsing history?</p>
<p>No, RevTrax only knows associated method (such as the specific search term, ad, website and URL) that sent traffic to the coupon and if you go to the coupon more than once.  For example, if you click on an ad on Google's website, we would know that Google drove someone to the coupon and any other information contained in that URL.</p>
