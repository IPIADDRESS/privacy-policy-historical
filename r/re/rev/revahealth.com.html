            <h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>

            <p>You should also be aware that where you link to another website from this website, that whatclinic.com has no control over that other website. Accordingly, whatclinic.com cannot guarantee that the controller of that website will respect your privacy in the same manner as whatclinic.com.</p>

            <h3>Access to your Personal Information</h3>

            <p>You have the right to request a copy of the information which we hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have inaccuracies in your information corrected.</p>

            <h3>Use of your Personal Information by Third Parties</h3>

            <p>Except as otherwise set out in this Privacy Statement this policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that whatclinic.com collects from you. We cannot guarantee and accept no liability in the event that a Provider (if you are a consumer) or any other third party gives your personal data to third parties or in any way impinges upon your data protection or privacy rights.</p>

            <h3>Technical and Statistical Data</h3>

            <p>Due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the protection of your personal data and therefore we are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting to you when the website is used. You should be aware that each time you visit a website, two general levels of information about your visit can be retained. The first level comprises statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate and non-individual specific basis of all browsers who visit the website and the second is information which is personal or particular to a specific visitor who knowingly chooses to provide that information.</p>

            <p>The statistical and analytical information provides us with a general and non-individual specific information about the number of people who visit this website; the number of people who return to the website; the pages that they visit; and where they were before they came to the website and the page in the website at which they exited. This information helps us monitor traffic on a website so that we can manage the website's capacity and efficiency. This type of non-personal information and data can be collected through the standard operation for internet servers and logs as well as "cookies" and other technical mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>IP Addresses and Cookies</h3>

            <p>Like almost all commercial websites, WhatClinic.com records statistical data and uses Cookies to improve site performance.</p>

            <h6>Statistical data:</h6>

            <p>The WhatClinic.com site logs certain statistical data, such as IP address, the type of operating systems used and browser types used. This statistical data is not connected to personal information, and so user information is anonymous. For example, if we know that a growing number of users have a new type of browser, we know that itâ€™s a good idea to test new pages and features in that browser.</p>

            <h6>What are cookies?</h6>

            <p>A Cookie allows websites to remember you, and it helps many of the features of the website to work better. We use Cookies to help our website load faster, and to make it easier and faster for users to log in. These small packets of information are stored on your computer by your browser. Cookies help us learn about how people interact with our site, and so we can make improvements based on the information.</p>

            <h6>What kind of Cookies do we use?</h6>

            <p>Our site uses two kinds of Cookies; our own, and Cookies from third parties. We use Cookies to operate and personalize the website. They help us to track page views and conversion and also return visits from users over a two year period.</p>

            <h6>What third-party services do we use?</h6>

            <p>â€˜Third partiesâ€™ are approved partner websites and those Cookies can be used for things like measurement and reporting, but may be also used to track your interests and to retarget you on other websites with advertising. We aim to be as transparent as possible around our use of Cookies, so we've listed all the third parties we work with below.</p>

            <p>Google Analytics is used to track general visitor interactions such as page views and conversion. We also use it for demographic and interest reporting and to understand our audience for remarketing purposes. We also use it to measure the success of marketing campaigns using Google Adwords and Bing Ads.</p>

            <p>To learn more about Google's data policy see here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. Google provides a tool to allow you to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics. Click here <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a> to download it.</p>

            <p>We use AdRoll to track how you use the site to target ads to you on other websites. Information about how to opt out of AdRoll services can be found here <a target="_blank" href="https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203845070-How-do-I-opt-out-">https://help.adroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/203845070-How-do-I-opt-out-</a>.</p>

            <p>We use a Facebook Cookie for audience building and conversion tracking. Facebook's Cookie policy can be found here <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/">https://www.facebook.com/help/cookies/</a></p>

            <h6>How long do they last?</h6>

            <p>Cookies generally have a â€˜lifespanâ€™ and after that period they expire. Some expire as soon as you log off, and some last for weeks or longer. Cookies on our site are renewed when you visit or log in, and usually expire after 7 to 30 days of inactivity. Cookies that we use to personalise the experience for returning visitors may have a lifespan of up to two years.</p>

            <h6>Switching off cookies:</h6>

            <p>Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies. Your browser should tell you how to turn off the automatic acceptance of Cookies if you look through settings. This will almost certainly create issues when using the whatclinic.com site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse all Cookies, our system will issue Cookies when you log on to our site. If you are concerned with 3rd party Cookies (other than our own) there is excellent advice available here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/</a> </p>
