If you do not read or if you disagree with any aspect of the Privacy  Statement, you should not use this website. Your use of this website signifies  your agreement to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Statement. </p>

RevaHealth.com  retains the right at all times to contact you in relation to the services  provided on this website. </p>

<p>Links to Third Party Sites<br>
  You should also be aware that where you link to another website  from this website, that RevaHealth.com has no control over that other website.&nbsp; Accordingly, RevaHealth.com cannot guarantee that the  controller of that website will respect your privacy in the same manner as  RevaHealth.com. </p>
<p>Access to your Personal Information <br>
  You have the right to request a copy of the information which we  hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have  inaccuracies in your information corrected. </p>
<p>Use of  your Personal Information by Third Parties<br>
  Except as otherwise set out in this Privacy Statement this  policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that RevaHealth.com collects  from you.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee and accept  no liability in the event that a healthcare provider (if you are a consumer) or  any other third party gives your personal data to third parties or in any way  impinges upon your data protection or privacy rights.</p>
<p>Technical and Statistical Data&nbsp; <em>[Note: Please confirm that this is  accurate.]</em><br>
  Due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the  protection of your personal data and therefore we are not responsible for any  loss or damage resulting to you when the website is used. You should be aware  that each time you visit a website, two general levels of information about  your visit can be retained. The first level comprises statistical and other analytical  information collected on an aggregate and non-individual specific basis of all  browsers who visit the website and the second is information which is personal  or particular to a specific visitor who knowingly chooses to provide that  information. </p>
<p>The statistical and analytical information provides us with a  general and non-individual specific information about the number of people who  visit this website; the number of people who return to the website; the pages  that they visit; and where they were before they came to the website and the  page in the website at which they exited. This information helps us monitor  traffic on a website so that we can manage the website's capacity and  efficiency. This type of non-personal information and data can be collected  through the standard operation for internet servers and logs as well as  "cookies" and other technical mechanisms. </p>
<p>Cookies are small data files that a website can use in order to  recognise visitors who revisit a website so as to facilitate their ongoing  access to and use of the website. Cookies are used by websites to store  visitor's user settings and therefore most browsers are initially configured to  accept cookies. Typically, cookies involve the assigning of a unique number to  the visitor. You should be aware that RevaHealth.com is unable to control the use of  cookies or the resulting information by other third parties such as advertisers  or parties hosting data for RevaHealth.com. One simple way to prevent the use of cookies  is to activate the facility which is available in most web browsers that  enables a user to deny or accept cookies. However, you should realise that  certain cookies may be necessary in order to provide you with certain features  such as the customised delivery of certain information. </p>
<p>Disclaimer <br>
  REVAHEALTH.COM ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SERVANTS AND AGENTS, AFFILIATES  OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES,  SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIMS, EMERGENCIES, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF  ACTION, DAMAGES, LOSSES, EXPENSES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE  LEGAL FEES AND COSTS OF PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE  USE AND/OR DISSEMINATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CONSENTS. </p>
<p>Amendments <br>
  Revahealth.com reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend this  privacy policy at any time, and you should regularly check this privacy policy  for any amendments. </p>
<p>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<br>
  This Privacy Statement is  governed by the laws of Ireland and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of  the Irish courts.</p>
