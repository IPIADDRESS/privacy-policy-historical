        <p>  <strong>Consumer</strong><br>
          If you are a consumer seeking to arrange a consultation with a  healthcare provider, then you will be asked to provide certain personal  information to us so that healthcare providers who are registered with us can  decide if they wish to offer medical services to you.&nbsp; Such information will include, without  limitation, details such as your name, address, contact details (including  email and telephone number) and relevant medical information.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>If you do not wish to provide your name to us, you may use an  alias.&nbsp; If you wish to arrange a  consultation with a healthcare provider, then you acknowledge that we may  provide all information that you have submitted to us via the website including  any personal information to that healthcare provider and you explicitly consent  to such disclosure<strong><em>.&nbsp; </em></strong>This  information may also include statistical information concerning your use of the  website.&nbsp; You also explicitly consent  to the transfer and disclosure of your personal information to Healthcare  Providers that are based in countries where protections for personal data are  not as strong as those in Ireland under the Acts or in the European Union  generally.</p>
        <p>We use any personal information you provide to identify you as a  prospective patient, to process your request for medical services, and to  deliver relevant information about you to healthcare providers and to  facilitate consultations with healthcare providers.&nbsp; We may also use your contact details, phone  number and email address, to contact you from time to time to update you as to  progress in relation to your consultation with a Healthcare Provider and other  matters concerning the service we provide.&nbsp;  You consent to us contacting you in this regard. &nbsp;We will not give or sell your personal  information to any third parties for marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
        <p>You also acknowledge and agree that in certain circumstances we  may be obliged to disclose personal information that you have provided to us to  third parties, for example, in order to conform to any requirements of law or  to comply with any legal process, as well as to protect and defend our rights.</p>

          If you are a healthcare provider (or a representative of a  healthcare provider) who wishes to use RevaHealth.com’s online marketplace, then you will  be asked to submit personal information as part of our registration process,  for example, name, email address, phone number etc.&nbsp; This personal information will be used to  facilitate medical consultations with prospective patients.&nbsp; You explicitly consent to the disclosure of all  necessary personal information to prospective patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than this authorised disclosure, RevaHealth.com  will not release any personal information to any third parties without your  prior consent except for the purposes of validating information or unless we  reasonably believe that we are required to do so by operation of law. RevaHealth.com  retains the right at all times to contact you in relation to the services  provided on this website. </p>

        <p>You also acknowledge and agree that in certain circumstances we  may be obliged to disclose personal information that you have provided to us to  third parties, for example, to our credit card payment service provider, in order  to conform to any requirements of law or to comply with any legal process, as  well as to protect and defend our rights and/or the rights of prospective  patients.</p>
        <p><strong>General</strong><br>
          If at any time after giving us this information you decide that  you no longer wish us to hold or use this information, or in the case that the  information becomes out of date, you are free to notify us, and we will  endeavour to remove or rectify the information promptly.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>We do not collect or keep your personal data unless it is necessary  for the purposes(s) set out above nor do we keep your personal data for longer  than is necessary.</p>
        <p>RevaHealth.com reserves the right to transfer information (including any  personal information you provide) to a third party in the event of a sale,  merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of  the assets of RevaHealth.com , a subsidiary or line of business associated with RevaHealth.com.</p>
        <p>Links to Third Party Sites<br>
          You should also be aware that where you link to another website  from this website, that RevaHealth.com has no control over that other website.&nbsp; Accordingly, RevaHealth.com cannot guarantee that the  controller of that website will respect your privacy in the same manner as  RevaHealth.com. </p>
        <p>Access to your Personal Information <br>
          You have the right to request a copy of the information which we  hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee) and to have  inaccuracies in your information corrected. </p>
        <p>Use of  your Personal Information by Third Parties<br>
          Except as otherwise set out in this Privacy Statement this  policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information that RevaHealth.com collects  from you.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee and accept  no liability in the event that a healthcare provider (if you are a consumer) or  any other third party gives your personal data to third parties or in any way  impinges upon your data protection or privacy rights.</p>
        <p>Technical and Statistical Data&nbsp; <em>[Note: Please confirm that this is  accurate.]</em><br>
          Due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the  protection of your personal data and therefore we are not responsible for any  loss or damage resulting to you when the website is used. You should be aware  that each time you visit a website, two general levels of information about  your visit can be retained. The first level comprises statistical and other analytical  information collected on an aggregate and non-individual specific basis of all  browsers who visit the website and the second is information which is personal  or particular to a specific visitor who knowingly chooses to provide that  information. </p>
        <p>The statistical and analytical information provides us with a  general and non-individual specific information about the number of people who  visit this website; the number of people who return to the website; the pages  that they visit; and where they were before they came to the website and the  page in the website at which they exited. This information helps us monitor  traffic on a website so that we can manage the website's capacity and  efficiency. This type of non-personal information and data can be collected  through the standard operation for internet servers and logs as well as  "cookies" and other technical mechanisms. </p>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that a website can use in order to  recognise visitors who revisit a website so as to facilitate their ongoing  access to and use of the website. Cookies are used by websites to store  visitor's user settings and therefore most browsers are initially configured to  accept cookies. Typically, cookies involve the assigning of a unique number to  the visitor. You should be aware that RevaHealth.com is unable to control the use of  cookies or the resulting information by other third parties such as advertisers  or parties hosting data for RevaHealth.com. One simple way to prevent the use of cookies  is to activate the facility which is available in most web browsers that  enables a user to deny or accept cookies. However, you should realise that  certain cookies may be necessary in order to provide you with certain features  such as the customised delivery of certain information. </p>
        <p>Disclaimer <br>
          REVAHEALTH.COM ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SERVANTS AND AGENTS, AFFILIATES  OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENT AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES,  SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIMS, EMERGENCIES, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF  ACTION, DAMAGES, LOSSES, EXPENSES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE  LEGAL FEES AND COSTS OF PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE  USE AND/OR DISSEMINATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CONSENTS. </p>
        <p>Amendments <br>
          Revahealth.com reserves the right in its sole discretion to amend this  privacy policy at any time, and you should regularly check this privacy policy  for any amendments. </p>
        <p>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<br>
          This Privacy Statement is  governed by the laws of Ireland and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of  the Irish courts.</p>
