<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Consumer privacy is very important to Revenue Science. That's why our technology and the way we use it exceeds all the industry standards for protecting your privacy online. Through our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information, install software on users' computers, or track keystrokes. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" class="external"><img src="images/logo-nai.gif" class="right" alt=""><em></em></a></p>

<p>Revenue Science belongs to and conforms to the standards of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which enables consumers to opt out of having their behavior tracked by our technology.</p>

<p>Please feel free to view our Privacy Policy in detail below. If you have questions or concerns regarding our stance on privacy, please e-mail <a href="mailto:privacy@revenuescience.com">privacy@revenuescience.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy Regarding Clients of Revenue Science's Services</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.revenuescience.com&amp;sealid=101" class="external"><img src="images/truste.gif" class="right" alt=""><em></em></a> This document is intended to inform you, the end user, about how Revenue Science handles information we process on behalf of our Web site owners, advertisers, and service providers who use our services (our "Clients") as part of our data analytics services and information we process for our network advertising services. This document also explains our own practices for our corporate Web site.</p>

<p>Revenue Science is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  <strong>This privacy statement covers the Web site http://www.revenuescience.com.</strong>  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@revenuescience.com">privacy@revenuescience.com</a>.  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as liaison with us to resolve your concerns. Revenue Science complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. <a href="https://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.revenuescience.com&amp;sealid=102" class="external"><img src="images/truste_seal.gif" class="right" alt=""><em></em></a></p>

<p>Revenue Science reserves the right to change how we handle information we process on behalf of our Clients as well as our own practices in regard to Revenue Science's services or corporate Web site.</p>

<h3>What does Revenue Science do?</h3>
<p>We provide data analysis and audience segmentation services based on information provided by our Clients regarding their customer interactions, including those on the Client's Web site or online advertisements. We create usage/behavior/interest-based categories called "segments". Segments are unique groups of users that are created using Client-defined criteria that enable the Client to selectively serve targeted advertisements and otherwise profile users of that Client's site(s) or advertisements. We are an outsource solution for what many companies traditionally have done internally, including traffic pattern and behavioral trend evaluations to enhance the usefulness and marketing power of their sites and services. Companies outsource these services to us to reduce cost, increase efficiencies, and decrease turnaround time.</p>

<p>We also provide targeting advertising services using non-personal information that is gathered across multiple, unaffiliated Web sites that use our network. Much like our data analytic services provided for specific Web sites, we create network segments that are used to serve targeted advertisements and profile users in our network.</p>

<h3>What information do we collect for our Clients and how do we use it for our data analytics services?</h3>

<p>Our Clients collect information about their customer interactions using cookies, action tags, and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. Web site owners use cookies to, among other things, monitor site usage, customize site features, identify a user's computer operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag (also known as a "clear gif" or "Web beacon") is a small, graphic image on a Web page that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site by collecting the IP address of the computer that the tag is sent to, the URL of the page the tag comes from, and the time it was viewed. Tags also may be associated with cookie information.</p>

<p>A Client may provide information that it collects, including personally identifiable information, to Revenue Science. We also may collect data on behalf of a Client using tags. Information that we collect and compile directly from users includes "clickstream" data such as behavioral data, IP addresses, log files, and other traffic data. We do not collect any personally identifiable information directly from any user, whether using cookies or action tags. As part of our analytics and segmentation services, we may place a cookie on your browser when you visit the Client's Web site or view an advertisement of the Client.</p>

<p>We use data provided by the Client, as well as data that we collect on behalf of the Client, only to create segments and reports for the Client. Additionally, we make information that we collect for or receive from a particular Client available only to that Client.</p>

<p>We may provide our analytic or segmentation services to Clients that are network advertisers or service providers. These Clients may use a process whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery (called "Online Preference Marketing" ["OPM"]). On behalf of and at the direction of an OPM Client, we may collect non-personal information that the Client may use for OPM purposes on behalf of its customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. OPM Clients are responsible for notifying you of these collection practices and making opt-out procedures available (if any).</p>

<p>A Client may correlate or merge information that we report to it with personal information already collected or accessible by that Client. On behalf of a Client, we may correlate or merge personal information provided by the Client with non-personal information that we collect for that Client. Our Clients are responsible for notifying you whether they correlate or merge personal information to non-personal information that they collect or that we or any other third party collects on their behalf.</p>

<p>Revenue Science firmly supports and encourages our Clients to adopt privacy policies that fully inform the Client's customers or users about the Client's information collection practices and use of Revenue Science's services. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices of any Web site you visit to understand what information the site collects, how the information is used, what choices you have, how to access the information, and how it is safeguarded.</p>

<h3>Do we disclose or permit access to our Client's information?</h3>

<p>We keep all data that we receive from and store for our Clients strictly confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such confidentiality and we hold our vendors and subcontractors to the same standards whenever they provide services related to the Client's information. We do not permit access to the information except as directed by our Client.</p>

<h3>What information do we collect and how do we use it for our network advertising services?</h3>

<p>Separate from our data analytics services, we provide OPM or network advertising services. For these services, we use a process, whereby data is collected over time and across the Internet to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences typically for use in ad delivery. Our Web tags, beacons, or cookies may collect non-personal information that may used for OPM purposes on behalf of our customers, including advertisers and Web site owners. Our systems are designed not to collect, process, or store personal information.</p>

<p>As part of Revenue Science's commitment to respect privacy concerns and implement industry-recognized standards, Revenue Science is a member of the NAI. RSI complies with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles which are designed to inform consumers about data collection and advertising practices across multiple Web sites and provide the ability to opt out. For more information about OPM and network advertising, please visit the NAI Web site at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" class="external">http://www.networkadvertising.org<em></em></a>.</p>

<h3>Do we disclose or permit access to information that we collect for our network services?</h3>

<p>No. The user information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our network service is not shared with any third party. To provide our network advertising services, we do enable our customers to customize the segments and other user characteristics that they will use to serve and deliver advertisements. Our network advertising customers are contractually prohibited from using any network segment information to correlate it to or merge it with information that they may collect, process, or store in connection with their site, including personal information except in compliance with the applicable Self-Regulatory NAI Principles, and such customer's privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Do I have the ability not to be identified for Revenue Science's network advertising services?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you do not want your browser to be identified and used for network advertising (OPM) purposes, you may visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" class="external">http://www.networkadvertising.org<em></em></a> for information on how to obtain an "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being associated with your browser. Please note that if you elect to opt out, the cookie associated with your browser will be associated with a "blank" or "generic" cookie. Therefore, advertisements that may be served to you on Web sites using our services may repeat and may not be targeted to your interests. <a href="pdfs/nai.pdf" class="external">Click here for instructions on how to opt out <em></em></a>of Revenue Science's network advertising services.</p>

<h3>Do we have a "P3P" policy?</h3>

<p>Yes, Revenue Science also subscribes to a P3P policy, which may be viewed in plain text by accessing the "Privacy Report" in your browser. To the extent that there is any inconsistency between the machine-readable P3P policy and this privacy statement, this privacy statement governs.</p>

<h3>How do we store information?</h3>

<p>All information that is provided by our Clients is stored in a database unique to each Client. We do not commingle or share data between or among our Clients. Revenue Science takes reasonable steps to assure that all Client information sent to us from our Clients is secured from unauthorized interception and to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in storage while under our control. While we have taken efforts to guard information, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>

<h3>Do we have a mechanism to address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?</h3>

<p>Revenue Science, Inc. participates in the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to dispute resolution by TRUSTe relating to compliance with our privacy statement. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@revenuescience.com">privacy@revenuescience.com</a>.</p>

The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English.</p>

<p>If you have questions regarding our compliance with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles, NAI and its members have engaged TRUSTe to create and manage an independent program for the purpose of ensuring that the NAI members like RSI comply with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles. Please refer to the NAI site for more information at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/enforcement.asp" class="external">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/enforcement.asp<em></em></a>.</p>
