<h3>About Our Online Behavioral Advertising Services</h3>
<p>AudienceScience works with advertisers, publishers and other  businesses, to deliver targeted or personalized ads, to consumers. In order to  target ads we create and use âaudience segmentsâ. These audience segments are  based on data that is anonymously collected over time and across the Internet  to determine or predict user characteristics, behavior, or preferences. Consumers  benefit from receiving more relevant ads. Advertisers and publishers benefit  from more effective advertising. </p>
For example, a consumer that is reading reviews  about hybrid cars might be placed into our In-Market Hybrid Car segment. As a  result, they might receive ads for Hybrid Cars, rather than ads for trucks or  minivans.
<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p>We only collect personal information  when we are contacted directly by an individual through our web site and they  provide that information to us. That information may include name, email  address or phone number.</p>
<p>  We use this information only to  respond to these requests or inquiries. We do not provide this information to  third parties.</p>
<p>  We do not use this personal  information for our online behavioral advertising services.</p>
<p>  Anyone who has provided personal  contact information through the AudienceScience corporate web site may e-mail  AudienceScience at <a href="mailto:info@audiencescience.com" class="blue_links">info@audiencescience.com</a> to update, delete, and/or correct  their personal contact information. AudienceScience will respond to such a  request within thirty (30) days of the date the request is submitted.</p>
<h3>Non-Personal Information We Collect</h3>
<p>For our online behavioral  advertising (OBA) services, we collect only non-personally identifiable  information. All data collected for those services is anonymous. We do not  collect any personally identifiable information (PII) for use with OBA.</p>
<p>  We collect information through  the use of common internet technologies, such as cookies and beacons, on the  web sites of those companies that participate in our online behavioral  advertising services. We do not install software on  users' computers or track keystrokes. We may also use third parties cookies or web beacons to collect  Non-Personal identifiable information on our or other websites.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
When you visit a participating  web site, AudienceScience places one or more cookies on your computer. Cookies  are small text files that can be used by a web site to store information on a  users' machine and later retrieve it. We use cookies to store information that can  be used to serve ads relevant to your interests. We do not store any personally  identifiable information in the cookies. We also use cookies when you opt-out  via the industry opt-out page. Should you choose to opt-out, we delete all  previously collected information from the cookies, and put new information in  the cookie which tells us to stop collecting information from that device.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br>
The use of cookies by our [partners,  affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] is/is not covered by  our privacy statement.&nbsp;We do/do not have  access or control over these cookies.&nbsp;  Our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers]  use session ID cookies [to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in  order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.]</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
Web sites and web pages contain  links to other web sites. These might be links to images, videos, other web  pages, ads or other types of content. We collect data from web sites that place  a link to our web servers on their web site. We call this link a beacon. (They  are also known as an action tag, clear gif or tracking pixel). A beacon is  designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor or collect  information about a site visitor. The type of information collected might  include the IP address of the computer, the web page being viewed, the  date/time it was viewed, and user activity on the page. We may use the IP  address to infer information, such as geolocation. We do not use the IP address  to identify users. We do not collect PII. </p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong><br>
We collect data only from web sites we have a business relationship  with. We anonymously collect data over time and across these sites to create usage/behavior/interest-based  audience segments. </p>
<p>We also collect data from third party data providers, which may collect  data from online and/or offline data sources, such as demographic, product  purchase or registration information. For example, when a consumer signs up for  a loyalty card at a retail store, the consumer may agree to allow the retailer  to use the purchase data for marketing purposes. The retailer, or a third party  they work with, will then repackage the purchasing data of many consumers in a  way that it can be used for online marketing. When that data is shared with  AudienceScience, any personally identifiable information has been removed. What  we receive is a group (audience segment) of anonymous users that are interested  in certain products or services, such as cars, electronics, or clothing. We  work closely with these data providers to ensure that we donât receive personally  identifiable information when this data is provided to us. </p>
<p>We contractually require the web sites and data providers we collect  data from to follow the OBA principles and practices we adhere to. This  includes provides users with a notice on their web site that they collect data  and a link to an opt-out.</p>
<p>We provide consumers with a means to opt-out of data collection. To  opt-out, please see the âChoicesâ section below. </p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Information</strong><br>
AudienceScience does not create nor use any sensitive data segments to tailor ads on behalf of our advertiser clients. However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data segments collected and used by AudienceScience, we will provide some examples of them here. For example, we may use health related segments such as Cholesterol and Dental, Oral Care or finance related segments such as Retirement Planners or Real Estate and Mortgage Shoppers.</p>
<p>While we don't consider any of the above data segments to be sensitive, we think its important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions. And we don't use any data segments to determine credit worthiness, for insurance underwriting or similar purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong><br>
We do not target children under the age of thirteen (13). Children  under the age of 13 may be placed into one of our general audience segments, based  on the web activity of the computer/browser they are using. We are unable to  prevent this as we do not collect personally identifiable information and we  don't collect information with the intent of identifying users as being under  the age of 13.</p>
<h3>Uses of Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>To make advertising more relevant  to you, the audience segments we create are used by us, our clients and  partners, including advertisers and publishers, to deliver targeted advertising  on the Internet.</p>
<p>  In the process of serving an  advertisement to a consumer, we, or our partners, may decide to serve an ad  based on the audience segment(s) that a particular customer is in, and/or other  information we have about the user or site the ad comes from.</p>
<p>  The data we collect is also used  for reporting purposes, to give our clients more information about the  performance of their advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over  time.</p>
<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>Our OBA services are used by  advertisers, publishers and other companies providing online advertising  services. We may share aggregated, non-personal information and audience segments  with these clients to enable them to deliver targeting advertising. We only  share this information with authorized third parties and we require them to  follow the same OBA principles and practices we adhere to. When you opt-out of  our services, we stop sharing OBA data with these third parties. </p>
<h3>Information Security and Retention</h3>
<p>AudienceScience is committed to protecting the security of  the information we collect. We use a variety of technologies and procedures to  protect information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We restrict  access to authorized individuals. We conduct regular security audits overseen  by independent third parties. While  we have taken commercially reasonable efforts to guard information, we cannot  guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances  or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p>
<p>  Non-PII data collected by AudienceScience for OBA purposes  is generally retained for up to 90 days. In some cases, we may retain data for  up to two (2) years. As part of these OBA services, we also collect aggregated ad  delivery and reporting data. This limited type of aggregated advertising  performance data is kept indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
AudienceScience  keeps all data that it receives from and stores for our clients strictly  confidential. We are contractually obligated to maintain such confidentiality  and we hold our vendors and subcontractors to the same standards whenever they  provide services related to the client's information. We do not permit access  to the information except as directed by our clients.</p>
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>Anyone who has provided personal contact  information through our web site may e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@audiencescience.com" class="blue_links">info@audiencescience.com</a> to  update, delete, and/or correct their personal contact information. We will  respond to such a request within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>Consumers can opt-out of our  online behavioral services through any one of the ways described below (you  don't need to go to each opt-out site, one is sufficient). Once you opt-out,  you will continue to receive ads. They will no longer be as relevant to you, as  data collection for OBA purposes will have stopped.</p>
