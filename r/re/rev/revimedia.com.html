As you  know, Provider currently offers to users access to a collection of on-line  information related to our offers through login (referred to herein as  “Services”). This privacy policy was created to let you know what information  we collect from you, what we do with it and to ensure you that your information  will be respected. The Provider attempts to protect your privacy to the maximum  extent possible. By using the Site and the Services, you consent to the  following terms. <br>
<br>
This policy covers the following topics: <br>
