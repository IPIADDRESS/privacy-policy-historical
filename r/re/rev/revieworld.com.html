			</p>
			<h4>Sale of business</h4>
			<p>
				If our business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business so that the new owners can continue to offer the services currently offered by us.
