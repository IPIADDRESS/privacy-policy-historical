You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below:</li>
</ul><h5>Opt-Outs AND WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</h5>
<p>If you are located in the EU and we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To withdraw your consent, or to learn more about your rights as a data subject, please see send an email to support@revoffers.com with your request. Regardless of whether you are located in the EU or elsewhere, you may exercise the applicable opt-out options below.</p>
<h5><em>Web Browser/Cookie-Based Opt-Out</em></h5>
<p>You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. There are also many programs that allow you to manually delete your cookies.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads/interest-based advertising from us, our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You may use the NAI opt-out tool at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and other members. The DAA’s opt-out tool can be found at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. EU users who have provided their consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies to process their personal information (see the paragraph titled RIGHTS FOR EU USERS below) can use the EDAA’s opt-out tool which can be found at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, the opt-out from targeted ads must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. However, once you have opted out on one device (“Opted-Out Device”), we will not use any new data from the Opted-Out Device to identify you on another device for interest-based advertising purposes, and will not use data from another device for interest-based advertising purposes on the Opted-Out Device.</p>
<p>If you erase or otherwise alter your cookie/device settings (including upgrading certain browsers or devices) you may need to perform each opt-out process again, unless we can match the device as outlined above.</p>
<p>Even if you opt out of targeted ads based on cookies, you may still see ads based on other general factors such as webpage context or browser type.</p>
<h5><em>Mobile Application-Based Opt-Outs</em></h5>
<p>Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. Users may opt out of certain advertisements on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings. To learn how to limit ad tracking or to reset the advertising identifier on your iOS and Android device, click on the following links:</p>

<p>Specifically, we use your information as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Sharing it with third parties such as Business Customers, advertising partners, Ad Networks, Data Providers and corporate affiliates. This is in order to allow our Business Customers to operate online advertising campaigns, conduct internal analysis to perform and to improve the effectiveness of the advertising services we provide to our Business Customers, associated technologies, and the services of our corporate affiliates.</li>
    <li>Combining information we collect about you with information we obtain from Business Customers and other partners, Ad Networks and/or other companies such as Data Providers including our corporate affiliates (pursuant to their own privacy policies). This is in order to provide Services to our Business Customers such as tools to see how their website or mobile applications are used and tools to enable the display of targeted advertisements across multiple devices.

    <li>Determining whether a web user profile fits a relevant segment (e.g., a web user that visits a sporting good website might fit within the segment of users interested in sporting goods).</li>
    <li>Presenting advertisements tailored to interests you have shown. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, we or our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites or applications you view with information on that product. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. We may use Ad Networks to deliver advertisements and related services to you on behalf of our advertisers.</li>
    <li>Determining whether multiple devices (e.g., a desktop computer and a mobile phone) are connected by applying probabilistic techniques (e.g., algorithmic and other mathematical techniques) to data that we collect. For example, determining the probability that a desktop web cookie and a mobile device belonging to the same user. We may supplement such probabilistic data with deterministic data (e.g., unique identifiers). We may also share this device matching information with our Business Customers to enable them to provide advertising, analytics or other services.</li>
    <li>Determining whether you have seen a particular advertisement before to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.</li>
    <li>Understanding the patterns of people who see advertisements.</li>
    <li>Providing insights and reporting back to Business Customers and other partners. This includes statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a website or mobile application, optimization of the location of ad placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics, billing, and logging ads served on a particular day to a particular website or application.</li>
    <li>Determining the probability and nature of connections between devices.</li>
    <li>Creating online advertising models through lookalike modeling or similar research methodologies.</li>
</ul><p>As noted in the paragraph above, we may share information we collect about you with third parties such as our Business Customers, advertiser partners, Ad Networks and Data Providers. Third parties are not bound by this Privacy Policy. As such, except as provided herein or under applicable law, their use of any information or other data we share with them, third-party cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies may be governed by their own privacy policy or permissions you granted them.</p>
<p>To be clear, we may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, collect or create information that is not personal information such as sets of aggregate data and other generalized information, including information about browsing, usage and interactions and de-identified personal information that does not reveal your identity. We retain the right to use and disclose information that is not personal information in any manner permitted by law.</p>
<h5>DO NOT TRACK</h5>
<p>There is currently no universally recognized standard for Do Not Track signals. Accordingly, at this time, cookies used on our website and used in providing our services do not respond to any Do Not Track signals or browser settings. You may opt-out of receiving cookies by adjusting your web browser settings to reject cookies.</p>

<h5>RIGHTS OF EU USERS</h5>
<p>If you are located in the EU and EU data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove and restrict the processing of your information. You also have the right to object to the processing of your information or export your information to another service.</p>
<p>When you first visit a website or application, we read cookies and similar technologies on the internet browser of your device or in connection with applications you use that allows us to identify browsers and devices that have previously interacted with our Services or Business Customers. This initial reading of cookies and similar technologies allows us to determine whether you or the user(s) of your device, have previously given consent to the use of “personal data” as defined under applicable EU law.</p>
<p>Apart from this initial browser or device reading, if you are located in the EU then the references in this privacy policy to the collection and use of your personal data will occur only after we determine the appropriate legal basis to process such information: (i) consent, (ii) legitimate interest (as described below), or (iii) our compliance with a legal obligation. References to the opt-out possibilities set forth above will apply to you if you have first given consent to the use of your personal data as outlined below. Then you may choose to limit how we may use your personal data. EU users also have specific rights which are enumerated below.</p>
<h5><em>Legal Basis For Using EU User Personal Data</em>:</h5>
<p>In the EU, the processing of your personal data must rely on a legal basis. For these regions, there are different legal bases that we rely on to use your personal data, namely:</p>
<ul><li>Legitimate interest: We may process your personal data for consumers, Business Customers, and our legitimate interests. For example, to provide or improve our Services, perform affiliate matching (e.g., for determining referral fees or commissions owed to Business Customers), manage relationships with Business Customers, or for security purposes and fraud prevention. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place safeguards to ensure that your privacy is protected and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms</li>
    <li>Consent: Our Business Customer and us will rely on your consent to use your personal data (including, without limitation, technical data, cookie data, usage information, and geo-location data), for personalized or interest-based advertising purposes. This allows our Business Customer and us to find other consumers with similar online behaviors to create lookalike modeling or to share your personal data with third parties for their marketing purposes. You may opt-out of your data usage at any time by using this Subject Access Request page or by using the tools outlined above.</li>
</ul><p>In addition to the other rights outlined above, individuals based in the EU also have the right to be informed of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Data Sharing: The direct recipients of your personal data include our corporate affiliates, as well as Business Customers such as advertisers and publishers in the RevOffers Ad Network. There may also be indirect recipients of a limited amount of personal data based on your internet activity because of how advertising technology and digital marketing function. Among the types of entities who may access data are: agencies, agency trading desks, retargeting entities, ad servers, privacy verification entities, measurement and analytics entities, data suppliers, data aggregators, demand-side platforms and supply side platforms, ad networks, and others on ours or our Business Customers’ behalf.</li>
    <li>Duration of the Processing: RevOffers may actively process your personal data for one year from the time of your last interaction with our Services or the websites or applications of our Business Customers (“Interaction Date”). We may, however, store your data in a pseudonymized or anonymized form for up to seven (7) years after the Interaction Date in order to comply with other legal requirements. After such time we delete your personal data from our system(s).</li>
    <li>Transfers of Personal Data: RevOffers and our Business Customers may be located in various countries throughout the world. As a result, personal data may also be transferred from the EU to the United States and other jurisdictions whose laws may differ from those in the EU. For data transfers to entities outside of RevOffers in countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, we may use specific contracts promulgated by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.</li>
</ul><h5><em>EU Data Subject Rights</em></h5>
<p>Under certain circumstances, EU users have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including as follows.</p>
<ul><li>Access, Correction, Restriction, Erasure and Portability: You have the right to (i) access your personal data which we may have in our system(s); (ii) request correction of your personal data we have in or system(s); (iii) object to or request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances; (iv) request erasure of your personal data from our system(s) under certain circumstances; and (v) request transfer of your personal data out of our system(s) in a commonly used format. To exercise the access, correction, restriction, erasure and portability rights, please send an email request to support@revoffers.com</li>
</ul><ul><li>Withdrawal of Consent: Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. In order to withdraw your consent, please submit a request to admin@revoffes.com</li>
</ul><ul><li>Right to Lodge a Complaint: EU users also have the right to lodge a complaint about RevOffers processing your personal data with your local data supervisory authority. We would, however, appreciate an opportunity to address your complaint before you approach the supervisory authority so please contact us in the first instance with any complaints you may have by sending an email to support@revoffers.com. </li>
</ul><p>RevOffers will use all reasonable efforts to facilitate your exercise of the above rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please note that in order for you to assert these rights, we need to verify your identity to confirm your rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In order to verify your identity, we may need to gather more personal data from you than we currently have.</p>
<h5>SECURITY</h5>
<p>We take appropriate reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information. This includes the necessary physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to protect data integrity, access and use. Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. As a result, we strive to protect your personal information but cannot ensure or warrant the security of your information against any possible loss or unauthorized access.</p>
<h5>CHANGE IN CONTROL</h5>
<p>Without limiting our other rights to transfer data and information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, RevOffers reserves the right in any of the following circumstances to transfer or assign the information we have collected. This includes RevOffers selling or transferring ownership, operation or control; is acquired by or merged with a third party entity; has an unlikely event of claiming bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally. The information transferred or assigned to these aforementioned events includes any personal information, if any, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, reorganization or other change of control. Any entity acquiring assets comprising or consisting of your information shall agree to handle such information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h5>COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS</h5>
