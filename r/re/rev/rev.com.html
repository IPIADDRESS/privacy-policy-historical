    <h1 class="home-title">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="muted">This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 8, 2012.</p>

    <h2>Our Policy:</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the web sites (collectively, the <strong>"Site"</strong>) of Rev.com, Inc. (
        <strong>"Rev"</strong>, "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is 
        operated by Rev and has been created to provide information about our company and translation and 
        document related services (the "Services") to our users ("you", "your"). This 
        Privacy Policy sets forth Rev's policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable 
        data (<strong>"Personal Data"</strong>), and other information that is collected from Site visitors 
        and users of the Services.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect:</h2>
    <p>When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information 
        from you, as further described below:</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you 
        voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, your 
        name and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. 
        Wherever Rev collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with 
        this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be 
        transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Rev and the authorized third 
        parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Non-IdentifiablAggregated Data:</strong> When you interact with Rev through the Site or 
        Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is 
        collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. 
        Rev may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and 
        maintained by Rev affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool 
        it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of 
        visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our 
        users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of
        the Services, Rev often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on
        the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an 
        aggregate basis. Rev may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and
        business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally.
        Rev may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and 
        prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
    <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of 
        information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies 
        help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, 
        our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and 
        then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will 
        not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" 
        section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you 
        are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because 
        they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.</p> 

    <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
    <p>Rev uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you 
        provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which
        it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer 
        your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the 
        Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of 
        such services. Rev and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use
        your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us 
        improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. 
        Rev and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services 
        or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing 
        communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future 
        marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative 
        communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. In 
        addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your 
        name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
    <p>If Rev intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy,
        you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is 
        collected.</p>

    <h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
    <p>Rev is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part 
        of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data
        with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. 
            In the event of a corporate sale, merger, 
            reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for 
            purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Rev, like many businesses, 
            sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions 
            include mailing information, maintaining databases, shipping and fulfillment and processing payments.
            When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the 
            information that they need to perform their 
            specific function.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Rev may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by 
            law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) 
            protect and defend the rights or property of Rev, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the 
            personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Your Choices:</h2>
    <p>You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may
        not be able to use certain Services.</p>

    <h2>Exclusions:</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Rev other than Personal Data 
        collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you 
        provide to Rev through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, 
        information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively, 
        "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other 
        unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall 
        be deemed to be non-confidential and Rev shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and 
        exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>

    <h2>Children:</h2>
    <p>Rev does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the 
        age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to 
        monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children 
        never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a 
        child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Rev through this Site, please contact us, and 
        we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Web Sites:</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or 
        controlled by Rev (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and procedures we described here 
        do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Rev endorses or has 
        reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy 
        policies.</p>

    <h2>Security:</h2>
    <p>Rev takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and 
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email or other electronic 
        transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information 
        you send to us in this way.</p> 

    <h2>Other Terms and Conditions:</h2>
    <p>Your access to and use of this Site is subject to our Terms of Service located at: 
        <a href="/about/terms">/about/terms</a></p>

    <h2>Changes to Rev's Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for 
        Rev to make changes to this Privacy Policy. 
        Rev reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time 
        without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal 
        Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of 
        the Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of 
        such revised Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Access to Information; Contacting Rev:</h2>
    <p>To keep your Personal Data accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take 
        reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via 
        this Site or Services. Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about Rev's 
        Privacy Policy or the information practices of this Site.</p>
