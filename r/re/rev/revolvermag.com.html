      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <p>Last Updated on October 1, 2007</p>
      <p>
	At Future US, Inc., a magazine, disc media and website publisher, we are interested in protecting 
	your privacy. But sometimes we do need information to understand how to make our properties more 
	interesting, more specialized and more successful, and this statement of privacy explains data collection 
	and use in those situations. Please read the complete privacy statement.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Non US Visitors:</strong></p>

      <p>
	Our privacy policy is intended to meet the laws and requirements of the United States. If you are 
	visiting from outside the United States any information you provide will be treated in accordance 
	with the laws of the United States or, if the law in jurisdiction does not permit you to access our 
	website, then you must not maintain access to it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Collecting your Personal Information:</strong></p>

      <p>
	We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (that is, your first and 
	last name; your home or business address; your e-mail address; your telephone number; your gender) 
	or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register 
	before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, or if you subscribe to one of our magazines or 
	properties, or elect to participate in a forum and/or a survey. Personal information collected by any 
	of our websites often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other 
	information when needed to provide a service to you.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example: If you choose to subscribe to a magazine or e-mail newsletter, we may request personal 
	information such as: name, address, telephone number, and shipping information.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Use of your Personal Information:</strong></p>

      <p>We may use your personal information for the following primary purposes:</p>
      <p>
      </p><ul>
	<li>
	    	To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. 
	</li>
	<li>	
	    To alert you to special offers, updated information and other services. 
	</li>
	<li>
	    To help us determine if any modifications need to be made to our publications or with respect to our subscriptions. 
	</li>
	<li>	
	    To contact you regarding participation in a reader survey. 
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <p>
	We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, 
	mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal 
	mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need 
	to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
	We also will occasionally share this information with third parties so that you may be informed of matters, 
	services or products of interest to readers of our magazines.
      </p>

      <p>
	We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the 
	good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with 
	legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) act in urgent circumstances 
	to protect the personal safety of users of any of our websites, or the public; and (d) comply with negotiated 
	agreements in the event of a merger or sale of any of our products.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Control of your Personal Information:</strong></p>
      <p>
	When you register on one of our websites, or otherwise give us personal information, we will not share 
	that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already 
	listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.
      </p>

      <p>
	We will occasionally allow other companies to offer our customers information about their products and 
	services. If you do not wish to receive any such mailings, you may send an e-mail to 
	<a href="mailto:webmaster@futureus.com">webmaster@futureus.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Security of your Personal Information:</strong>

      </p><p>
	Future US, Inc., will use its best efforts to protect the security of your personal information and honor 
	your choices for its intended use.
      </p>

      <p>
	Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Email Correspondence:</strong></p>

      <p>
	We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. This information and 
	emails would only be shared with a third party in connection with a court order, sale of the website(s) 
	to a third party or to defend a legal claim. These emails would only rarely be used for one time 
	correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy <br>(Users under the age of 13):</strong></p>
      <p> 
	In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online 
	Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which 
	Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In 
	accordance with our policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
      </p>

      <p>
      </p><ul>
      	    <li>
		Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; 
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; 
	    </li>
	    <li>	
		Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information; 
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more 
		information than is needed to participate in the activity. 
	    </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>

      <p><strong>Parental Rights:</strong></p>
      <p>
	Except upon our receipt from a parent or guardian, we DO NOT collect information from children under 
	13. We are required by COPPA to post parental rights concerning removal of this information.
      </p>
      <p>
	A parent or guardian may confirm, correct or have deleted the child's personal information; 
	discontinue further use of the child's information and/or communication with the child; and/or 
	revoke his or her earlier consent to collect and use the child's information. To do so, please 
	contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@futureus.com">webmaster@futureus.com</a> and we will review 
	or update your child's information as appropriate. Please be sure to include in your email message 
	the information you want changed or deleted.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Message Receipt &amp; COPPA:</strong></p>
      <p>
	Our receipt of messages is set up to only accept registrations from ages 13 and up. Any users 
	under 13 who try to register are screened via a online age check that uses cookies. Users under 13 
	who wish to register must submit a signed parental consent form to do so. The parent will 
	then decide what information to release on the parental form which may include address, phone 
	number &amp; email address. We maintain this information on file for COPPA compliance and do not share 
	this information with third parties. 
      </p>	
      <p>
	With proper identification parents can remove their under 13 child from participation in our 
	message board (See Parental Rights above).
      </p>

      <p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong></p>
      <p>
	To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, we may elect to collect aggregated 
	site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individual's use of the site.
      </p>

      <p> 
	We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit certain of our websites. 
	These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone 
	number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on 
	this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would

	recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we 
	have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set 
	cookies for advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
	Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser 
	to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some areas will not function properly if you do 
	so. There are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone 
	concerned about the use of cookies to do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision 
	about accepting them from any site. As technology advances and cookies provide more functionality, 
	we expect to utilize them in different ways.
      </p>

	<u>IP Address</u>. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to 
	your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its 
	IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our 
	site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information. The IP address is not 
	tied to any personally identifiable information
