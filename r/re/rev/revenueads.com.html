PRIVACY POLICY FOR
REVENUEADS, and each of its related web sites
(“RevenueAds”) Privacy Policy
Last updated January 1, 2009.
This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use and
disclosure of information collected via this Website. RevenueAds
provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed decision as to
whether to use or continue using the Website.
</strong><p><strong>
PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE
EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS
YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. REVENUEADS DOES NOT
PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES
AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY
POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO REVENUEADS OR USE
ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB
SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </strong>
</p><p>
This Privacy Policy applies to RevenueAds’s collection, use, storage
and disclosure of information by RevenueAds on its (a) websites,
including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies
(collectively, the "Website"), (b) on various third party websites, and
(c) to RevenueAds’s other information collection, including the
purchase of customer lists from third parties. RevenueAds is not
responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third
web sites or applications.
</p><p>
By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to
the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal
information you provide via the Website or through other official RevenueAds contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the
Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.
1. Collection of Information.
</p><p>
1.1 Survey Information.
</p><p>
RevenueAds collects information from individuals by various methods,
including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an
RevenueAds survey, order form, or a registration page either online
or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey").
(As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website,
and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than
online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell
phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, RevenueAds or a
third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various
information to RevenueAds, which may include his or her name, email
address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone
numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and
marital status, occupation, social security number, employment
information, personal and online interests, and such other information as
may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").
RevenueAds may also collect information concerning an individual
from another source and use that information in combination with
information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is
completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide
Survey Information to RevenueAds or Third Party, but an individual
may receive incentives from RevenueAds or a Third Party in exchange
for providing Survey Information to RevenueAds.
</p><p>
1.2 Third Party List Information.
RevenueAds collects information from individuals when an individual
provides information to a Third Party and RevenueAds subsequently
purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third
Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not
limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code,
telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date,

gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry
of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information
as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party
List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information,
RevenueAds seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a
right to transfer the Third Party List Information to RevenueAds and
that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the
individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.
</p><p>
1.3 Other Information.
Other occasions when RevenueAds obtains information from individuals
include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to
redeem an incentive offered by RevenueAds or by a third party, (2)
when an individual requests assistance through RevenueAds customer
service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a
RevenueAds service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").
</p><p>
1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
RevenueAds currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to
associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with
information about the individual in our database. Additionally,
RevenueAds may use other new and evolving sources of information in
the future (together, "Technology Information").
(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive
of the individual's computer that allows RevenueAds to identify the
individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in
RevenueAds’s database. You may read more about cookies at
http://cookiecentral. Individuals who use the Website need to accept
cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the
Website.
(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to
display an image on a web page (by using a  programming
function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be
used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the
form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with
previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This
allows RevenueAds to track certain web sites an individual visits
online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an
individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for
marketing purposes. For example, RevenueAds might place, with the
consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's
website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed
in RevenueAds’s database, visits the fishing website,
RevenueAds receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe
visited the baseball site, and RevenueAds would then update Joe's
profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball.
RevenueAds may thereafter present offers of baseball related
products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web
pages, RevenueAds also uses web beacons in email messages sent to
individuals listed in RevenueAds’s database.
(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including
cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is RevenueAds’s use
of new and evolving technology. As a result, RevenueAds strongly
encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding
its use of technology.
</p><p>
1.5 Outside Information.
RevenueAds may receive information about individuals from third
parties or from other sources of information outside of RevenueAds
including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").
</p><p>
1.6 Individual Information.
As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third
Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and
Outside Information, and any other information RevenueAds gathers or
receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing
data.
</p><p>
1.7 No Information Collected from Children.
RevenueAds will never knowingly collect any personal information
about children under the age of 13. If RevenueAds obtains actual
knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under
the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our
database. Because it does not collect such information, RevenueAds
has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.
RevenueAds has designed this policy in order to comply with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
</p><p>
1.8 Credit Card Information.
RevenueAds may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and
related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card
Information") when an individual places an order from RevenueAds.
When the Credit Card Information is submitted to RevenueAds, such
information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
RevenueAds will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of
processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card
Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to
complete the purchase transaction.
Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers will
automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers
send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include
information vital to validating the user’s authorization to access the
account. Information, such as a Web request, Internet Protocol (the “IP”)
address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and
visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order,
time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is
necessary to validate and authorize a user’s entry and activity on the
Website.
</p><p>
2. Use of Individual Information.</p><p>
2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</p><p>
<strong>THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE
PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.</strong></p><p>
The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how RevenueAds
currently uses Individual Information, but RevenueAds may change or
broaden its use at any time. As noted, RevenueAds may update this
policy from time to time. RevenueAds may use Individual Information
to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email
advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner
advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.
</p><p>

2.2 Email.</p><p>
RevenueAds uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers
by email to individuals. RevenueAds may maintain separate email
lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email
subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions
at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.
To unsubscribe from all RevenueAds’s email lists, a person must send
an email to support@revenueads.com.
</p><p>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.
In certain commercial email messages sent by RevenueAds, an
advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply"
button will cause a reply email to be sent to RevenueAds. The
"Subject:" line of RevenueAds email messages will usually contain a
line provided from the advertiser to RevenueAds.
</p><p>2.2(b) Solicited Email.
RevenueAds only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the
Website to receive email from RevenueAds or to individuals who have
agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as
RevenueAds. RevenueAds does not send unsolicited email
messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for
unsolicited email are not applicable to RevenueAds email messages.
</p><p>2.3 Targeted Advertising.
RevenueAds uses Individual Information to target advertising to an
individual. When an individual is using the Internet, RevenueAds
uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an
individual with that person's Individual Information, and RevenueAds
attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person
has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means
of Technology Information, and otherwise. RevenueAds may, at its
discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones,
cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional
offers.
</p><p>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.
RevenueAds uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or
indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing
using telephones and cell phones.
</p><p>2.5 Use of Technology Information.
RevenueAds uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's
Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of
Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to
track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine
which areas of RevenueAds’s web sites are most frequently visited.
This information helps RevenueAds to better understand the online
habits of individuals so that RevenueAds can target advertising and
promotions to them.
</p><p>2.6 Profiles of Individuals.
RevenueAds uses Individual Information to make a profile of an
individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and
Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information
such as information obtained from public databases.
</p><p>2.7 Storage of Individual Information.
RevenueAds stores the Individual Information in a database on
RevenueAds computers. Our computers have security measures (such as
a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration
of the information under RevenueAds’s control. Not withstanding such
measures, RevenueAds cannot guarantee that its security measures
will prevent RevenueAds computers from being illegally accessed, and
the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.
</p><p>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.
</p><p>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.
<strong>REVENUEADS MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD
PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN REVENUEADS SOLE DISCRETION.</strong>
</p><p>3.2 Order Fulfillment.
RevenueAds will transfer Individual Information to third parties
when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from
such third party while using RevenueAds web sites or when responding
to offers provided by RevenueAds.
</p><p>3.3 Legal Process.
RevenueAds may disclose Individual Information to respond to
subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.
</p><p>3.4 Summary Data.
RevenueAds may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such
as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or
sub-groups of persons.
</p><p>3.5 Access.
Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to
provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such
information. Access can be obtained by contacting
support@revenueads.com. RevenueAds may also grant advertising
clients and email services providers’ access to an individual's email
address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.
</p><p>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.
</p><p>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.
Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together,
"Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Website and on the Internet
generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to
collect information about individuals. RevenueAds does not control
Advertisers' use of such technology and RevenueAds has no
responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about
individuals.
</p><p>4.2 Links.
The Website and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the
web sites of third parties. RevenueAds is not responsible for the
privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Linked web sites
