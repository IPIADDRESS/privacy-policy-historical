  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>(Current version published: November 1, 2012)</p>


  <p>Reverb is built as a community and
  online listing/auction site for musicians, collectors,
  enthusiasts, dealers and the just-plain-curious to gather in a
  marketplace fully dedicated to buying and selling instruments.
  &nbsp;Therefore, the privacy of all of our members and
  stakeholders - your privacy - is something we take extremely
  seriously. &nbsp;This policy details how we treat the personal
  information that we collect, what settings we provide for you to
  control how your information is used on Reverb, and how you can
  contact us with any questions or concerns. &nbsp;This policy
  explains our privacy practices for Reverb.com and services
  provided by Reverb.com LLC
  (â€œReverbâ€).</p>

  <b>Information Collected or Received</b><br>
  <br>
  Reverb will not sell or disclose your name, email address or
  other personal information to third parties without your explicit
  consent, except as specified in this policy.<br>
  <br>
  In order to create an account with Reverb, you are required to
  provide a valid email address at registration and choose a
  username or alias that may represent your identity on Reverb.<br>
  <br>
  Depending on which services you choose to use, Reverb may require
  additional information, such as a shop name, billing information
  (including billing address, phone number, credit card
  information), a mobile telephone number, a physical mailing
  address, and/or payment information. As a shop owner if you
  choose to enable direct checkout, Reverb may require information
  such as your social security number or tax ID, date of birth,
  bank account information and/or credit card information in order
  to verify your identity and provide this service to you.<br>
  <br>
  You may optionally choose to provide your full name and other
  personal information (such as birthday, gender, location) to be
  publicly displayed in connection to your account and
  activity.<br>
  <br>
  Your username, Reverb ID or alias is publicly displayed and
  connected to your Reverb activity. Other people may see your date
  joined, feedback, ratings, profile information, items listed for
  sale, shop pages, sold item listings, and comments in community
  spaces.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb automatically receives and records some information from
  your browser when you visit the site, such as your IP address,
  cookies and data about which pages you visit on the site through
  the use of log files provided by our third-party tracking-utility
  partners. This information helps us analyze and understand how
  the site works for members and visitors.<br>
  <br>
  Some members or visitors may connect to or register an Reverb
  account using an external third-party application, such as
  Facebook. Reverb may receive some data from those connected
  third-party applications. Connecting your Reverb account to
  third-party applications or services is optional, and when you
  connect your account to an external app, you will be given the
  opportunity to grant permission. You can revoke your permission
  under your Reverb account settings.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb uses the information described in this policy to provide
  and improve our services and products, for billing, for
  identification and authentication purposes, to contact members or
  interested parties, and for general research and aggregate
  reporting. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Reverbâ€™s Terms of Use require all account
  owners to be at least 18 years of age (or have the permission and
  supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian),
  therefore, this policy does not discuss use of our site or
  services by minors.<br>
  <b><br></b><b>Choice &amp; Control</b><b><br></b><br>
  We know members of our community value having control over their
  own information, and therefore Reverb gives you the choice of
  providing, editing or removing certain information, as well as
  choice over how we contact you.<br>
  <br>
  You may change or correct your Reverb account information (except
  your username) at any time. You may remove certain optional
  information you no longer wish to be publicly visible, such as
  your full name.<br>
  <br>
  For various reasons, Reverb may contact you about our services or
  your activity. Some of these messages are required,
  service-related messages for members. Other messages are not
  required, and you can control which optional messages you choose
  to receive by changing your settings in your account. Learn more
  in the Messages from Reverb section of this policy.<br>
  <br>
  If you have optionally connected your account to an external,
  third-party application, such as Facebook, you can remove
  permission for the app by changing your account settings.<br>
  <br>
  If you no longer wish to use Reverbâ€™s
  services or receive service-related messages, then you may close
  your account.<br>
  <b><br>
  Messages from Reverb<br>
  <br></b>On occasion, Reverb will send you messages. The default,
  required form of communication is email. However, we may choose
  to offer additional ways to reach you, such as through text
  messaging (SMS) or physical mail.<br>
  <br>
  Some messages from Reverb are service-related and required for
  members. Examples of service-related messages include, but are
  not limited to: a welcome/confirmation email when you register
  your account, notification of an order, or correspondence with
  Reverbâ€™s support team. These messages are not
  promotional in nature. You may not opt-out of receiving
  service-related messages from Reverb, unless you close your
  account.<br>
  <br>
  As a member, Reverb may also send you messages related to certain
  features on the site or your activity. Reverb may also send you
  news or updates about changes to our site or services. By
  default, members will receive these messages via email, but you
  may choose to opt-out of getting certain emails under your
  account settings.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb offers optional email newsletters. You must opt-in or
  subscribe to begin receiving newsletters, and subscription is
  available to both members and non-members. Members may subscribe
  or unsubscribe from optional newsletters under your account
  settings or by following the instructions contained in the
  newsletter emails. Non-members may subscribe by providing an
  email address, which will only be used by Reverb for these
  newsletters. Non-members may unsubscribe from newsletters by
  following the instructions contained in the newsletter
  emails.<br>
  <b><br>
  Community<br>
  <br></b>Reverb is both a marketplace and a community. We are
  continuing to build features such as Forums, Messaging, Feedback,
  etc. in order to allow our members to communicate with one
  another. &nbsp;Please use common sense and good judgement when
  posting in these community spaces or sharing your personal
  information with others on Reverb. Be aware that any personal
  information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by
  others, or could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Reverb
  generally does not remove content from community spaces, and your
  posts may remain public after your account is closed. You are
  responsible for the personal information you choose to post in
  community spaces on Reverb.<br>
  <b><br>
  Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure<br>
  <br></b>We want to respect your privacy. Reverb will not sell or
  disclose your name, email address or other personal information
  to third parties without your explicit consent, except as
  specified in this policy.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb limits access to your personal information to employees
  who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that
  information to provide products or services to you or in order to
  do their jobs.<br>
  <br>
  As part of the buying and selling process, Reverb will share
  information between the two members involved in the transaction.
  You may obtain another Reverb member's email address, shipping
  address, payment information, and/or other information. As
  described in Reverb's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to
  use this information only for Reverb-related communications or
  for Reverb-facilitated transactions. Reverb has not granted you a
  license to use the information for unsolicited commercial
  messages. Without express consent from that person, you must not
  add any Reverb member to your email or physical mailing list.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb may release your personal information to a third-party in
  order comply with a subpoena or other similar legal procedure, or
  when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary
  to comply with the law; prevent imminent physical harm or
  financial loss; or investigate or take action regarding illegal
  activities, suspected fraud, or violations of Reverb's Terms of
  Use. We may disclose personally identifiable information to
  parties in compliance with our Copyright and Intellectual
  Property Policy, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary
  or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud,
  intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful
  activity. In such events, Reverb may disclose name, address,
  country, phone number, email address and company name.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb is or may be affiliated with a variety of businesses and
  works closely with them. These businesses may offer promotions or
  sell items or services to you through
  Reverbâ€™s services. Reverb may also provide
  services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due
  to the nature of our business model, when an affiliated business
  is associated with your transaction, we may share information
  that is related to such transaction with that affiliated
  business. Reverb may share aggregated demographic information
  with business partners.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our
  behalf, and we need to share your information with them to
  provide products and services to you. Examples include but are
  not limited to fulfilling orders, processing payments, handling
  billing disputes and collections, analyzing data, providing
  marketing assistance and providing customer service. Reverb may
  partner with third-party services for fraud prevention and/or
  identity verification.<br>
  <br>
  In some cases, Reverb may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
  types of transactions, member information is typically one of the
  business assets that is transferred. Reverb will transfer
  information about you if Reverb is acquired by or merged with
  another company. In this event, Reverb will notify you by email
  or by putting a prominent notice on the site before information
  about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
  privacy policy.<br>
  <br>
  When you a load a page on Reverb that has a social plug-in from a
  third-party site or service, such as a Like or Send button, you
  are also loading content from that third-party site. That site
  may request cookies directly from your browser. These
  interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party
  site.<br>
  <br>
  We can only speak for ourselves; this policy does not apply to
  the practices of third parties that Reverb does not own or
  control, or individuals that Reverb does not employ or manage. If
  you provide your information to others on Reverb or throughout
  the Internet, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure
  of the information you provide to them. Reverb does not control
  the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the
  privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Reverb
  is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other
  websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Reverb
  site. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your
  personal information to others.<br>
  <b><br>
  Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies<br>
  <br></b>Reverb uses a variety of technologies to help us better
  understand how people use our site and services.<br>
  <br>
  A cookie is a small data file sent from a web site to your
  browser that is stored on your computer's hard drive. Reverb uses
  our own cookies for a number of purposes, including to access
  your information when you sign in; keep track of preferences you
  specify; display the most appropriate content based on your
  interests and activity on Reverb; estimate and report Reverb's
  total audience size and traffic; conduct research to improve our
  content and services. You can configure your browser's settings
  to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies. If you
  reject all cookies, you will not be able to take full advantage
  of Reverb's services.<br>
  <br>
  Reverb may partner with third-party services who may use various
  tracking technologies, such as browser cookies or Flash cookies,
  to provide certain services or features. These technologies allow
  a partner to recognize your computer each time you visit Reverb,
  but do not allow access to personally identifiable information
  from Reverb. Reverb does not have access or control over these
  third-party technologies, and they are not covered by our privacy
  statement.<br>
  <b><br>
  Security<br>
  <br></b>The security of your personal information is important to
  us. Your Reverb account information is protected by a password.
  It is important that you protect against unauthorized access of
  your account and information by choosing your password carefully,
  and keeping your password and computer secure by signing out
  after using our services. Reverb encrypts sensitive information
  (such as credit card number) using secure socket layer technology
  (SSL). Reverb follows generally accepted industry standards to
  protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
  transmission and once Reverb receives it. No method of
  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
  is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
  acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
  guarantee its absolute security.<br>
  <b><br>
  Data Retention<br>
  <br></b>Reverb will retain your information for as long as your
  account is active or as needed to provide you services. &nbsp;If
  you no longer want Reverb to use your information to provide you
  services, you may close your account. Reverb will retain and use
  your information as necessary to comply with our legal
  obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<br>
  <b><br>
  Privacy Policy Changes<br>
  <br></b>Reverb reserves the right to modify this privacy
  statement at any time, so please review it periodically.
  Weâ€™ll communicate changes by posting a notice
  on the site. If we make material changes to this policy you will
  be notified here, by email, or other places Reverb deems
  appropriate.<br>
