<p><strong><font color="#993333">RealEstateInvestor.com Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very  important to us. We want to make your experience on RealEstateInvestor.com as  enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use  RealEstateInvestor.com’s abundance of information, tools, and opportunities  with complete confidence. <br>
  <br>
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to  privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects  information from all end users of our services (the "Services") - those  who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors")  - those who access our services by way of a non-fee based membership (“Members”)  as well as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to  subscribe to the Service ("Paid Members") - what we do with the  information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning  the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this  Privacy Policy carefully. <br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</strong><br>
<br>
Introduction: Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors  and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web  sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to  provide a customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and  generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may  disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission  beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such  disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. <br>
<br>
Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when  they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone  number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal  computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected  from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's  account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with  third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special  circumstances. <br>
However, in instances where  our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the  partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username  of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion  for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of  the promotion. <br>
In this instance, personal  information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also  generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information  Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the  names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this  aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear  on the Services. <br>
<br>
Our Company Partners and Sponsors: Some products and services may be offered to  Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor  seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these  products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal  information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is  collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or  feature. <br>
Additionally, our partners  may have advertisements or co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an  affiliate, independent contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our  company may share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as  described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to  administer the co-branded products or services offered. <br>
<br>
Online Shopping: At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or  register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and  service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact  information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and  credit/debit card information. <br>
If you complete an order for  someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you  may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the  recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over  the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing  such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. <br>
<br>
If you order services or products directly from our company we will use the  personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not share  this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to  complete that order. <br>
<br>
Online Advertisements: Our company may display our online advertisements. In  those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors  and Members collected through the registration process as well as through  online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. <br>
Additionally, in some  instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver  tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint  venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an  advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and  non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display or send the  advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does not share personal  information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or joint  venture companies.<br>
<br>
Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to  our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we  receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any other  purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. <br>
<br>
Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and  individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these  surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to  improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to  you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential,  even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer  surveys is voluntary. <br>
<br>
We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our  Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other  customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey  questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment,  industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated  information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new  services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information  may be shared with third parties.<br>
<br>
Special Cases: It is our company's policy not to use or share the personal  information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described  above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit  such unrelated uses. <br>
However, we may disclose  personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your  use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any  reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so,  including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies,  law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal  requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to  identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating  our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to  operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members. <br>
<br>

<br>
Public Forums: Please remember that any information you may disclose in any  Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet,  becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to  disclose personal information in these public areas. <br>
<br>
Our Company's Commitment to Data Security: Services and Web sites we sponsor  have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of  the information under our control.
