    <br>

    <strong>React2Media &amp; LeadReact Privacy policy, updated  April 2008.</strong> <br>

  React2Media LLC (f/k/a Leadreact) ("us", "we" or  "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy  Statement ("Privacy Statement") describes all of the information handling  practices for the web site located at www.LeadReact.com (the "Web Site"),  including how we handle personal information we may obtain when you use the Web  Site, and how we may share it. This Privacy Statement does not apply to  information we may obtain through other means, including offline or online in  another forum, such as elsewhere at other React2Media-owned web sites. This  Privacy Statement is effective upon acceptance in registration for new  registering users. This Privacy Statement is effective upon acceptance in  registration for new registering users.

  <br><br>

      If you have additional questions, you may send email to  <a href="mailto:info@react2media.com" class="more">info@react2media.com</a>.<br><br>

      <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p> <br>

      The Web Site delivers promotional incentives (such as coupons, rebates,  savings notices, samples and trial offers) using sophisticated database  technology on behalf of online and offline companies (our "Clients")  to registered consumers ("you", "your" or "Members")  of our Web Site. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to ensure your  confidence in us during your use of our Web Site, and demonstrate our firm  commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy.<br><br>

      <strong>Collection of Your Information</strong> <br><br>

      <strong>Information Collected to Enroll in the LeadReact  Program.</strong><br> To set  up your LeadReact membership, you will need to provide certain contact  information. The requested information may include any combination of data such  as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, username, and/or  password, amongst other contact information requirements. This basic  information is required if you wish to enroll on the Web Site. The registration  form information requests may change from time to time. We may append  additional data we obtain from our other owned web sites or third parties to  your enrollment information for analysis and marketing purposes. This information  will also allow us to provide better, more relevant offers to you.<br><br>

      <strong>Information Collected During Use of the Web Site.</strong> <br>When you  select an advertising offer on the Web Site or purchase a subscription or  merchandise through the LeadReact service from one of our Clients, we will  collect certain personal information as well as possibly financial information  (such as your credit card number) to permit you to complete your action. This  Client-requested information will only be provided to the specific sponsor of  that offer, and only if you choose to share your information for that offer. If  you have consented to receive e-mails from us, we also collect information  relating to your e-mail response data to enable us to provide more timely,  relevant offers and products.<br><br>

      <strong>Information Use and Sharing</strong> <br><br>

      <strong>Generally.</strong> When you become a LeadReact  Member, we use your enrollment information and activity data to manage your  account. We will not rent, sell or share any personal information we gather  from you to third parties except as indicated below or to provide information  regarding the products or services you have requested (for example, with your  consent we may disclose your personally identifiable information, such as your  name and address, to specified third parties that may then send you incentive  offers and other promotional materials through the mail or via e-mail). The  following describes the ways that your information may be used by us, or may be  disclosed in the normal course of business to provide our services.<br><br>

      <strong>Use of Information When You Select an Offer or  Purchase a Product/Service.</strong> <br>If you are interested in an offer from a Client,  we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your contact information  with them. The information you submit to Clients is subject to their own  privacy policies. For example, you may wish to receive more information  directly from a Client via e-mail or postal service, and you can use reply  forms at various points on the Web Site to communicate that information to a  Client. <br><br><strong>It is strictly your decision to pass such information to any Client.</strong> <br>In addition,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>some offers or services will require us, by their  terms, to forward your personal information (such as mailing address for  delivery of orders) to a Client so that they can provide the service directly  to you. Otherwise, your information is shared with Clients only on an aggregate  (non-personally identifiable) basis.<br><br>

      <strong>Use of Information to Notify You About Our Products  and Services.</strong> <br>We may use your information to inform you of other products or services  available from React2Media by making opportunities available to you on our  various web sites, by postal mail and, unless you opt out of receiving them, by  e-mail. We may also send you offers tailored to your interests, as well as  information about us, about our products and services, and about special offers  such as sweepstakes or other promotions. Sometimes, we send offers via e-mail  to selected groups of members on behalf of our participating merchants. When we  do this, we do not give the participating merchants your name and address. If  you do not want to receive e-mails we send on behalf of our participating  merchants, you may opt out of receiving them as detailed in the Opting Out of  Marketing E-mail Messages section below.<br><br>

      <strong>Use of Information About You We Obtain from Third  Parties.</strong> <br>We may  obtain information about you from our partner companies and other third parties  in order to provide you with opportunities tailored to your interests. We may  also use information obtained from our partner companies and other third  parties in conjunction with member account and enrollment information for  analytical and audit purposes.<br><br>

      <strong>Sharing Information with Our Business Partners and  Service Providers.</strong> <br>We may need to share some personal information  with our business partners, such as service providers and third party  processors who work with us to provide you the LeadReact program. These  companies use your personal information to provide us with the services we have  hired them to perform, such as to organize, administer, process, append and/or  analyze our data on our behalf, deliver offline materials to you or notify you  of savings when you are visiting other web sites. These companies will help us  provide more relevant offers to you and to eliminate the delivery of duplicate  offers from a Client(s) and all such business partners are prohibited from  using your personal information except to provide these services to the  LeadReact program, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of  your information. We may also share certain data with our Clients or service  providers in aggregate form for audit, marketing and other purposes. We may  transmit your search queries, if any, to business partners who use this  information to provide us with search results and other information, which we  then display to you. Because aggregated data is not associated with any  particular person, the third parties with whom we share this information will  not have access to your personally identifiable information.<br><br>

      <strong>Sharing Information with Our Direct Marketing  Partners.</strong> <br>From  time to time, we may provide your postal information and other relevant data to  trusted direct marketing partners who may mail direct marketing material on  behalf of us and also use this postal information and other data to market to  you on their own behalf. In our contact with these direct marketing partners,  we have restricted them from sharing or selling this information with any other  third party. We do not provide your e-mail address to these direct marketing  partners.<br><br>

      <strong>Legal Requests/Questionable Activities.</strong> <br>We will  release or disclose your personal information, including to local, state, or  federal law enforcement officials, when we believe in good faith that the law  requires it, or when required to do so by order of a court or authorized  administrative agency.<br><br>

      <strong>Sale/Merger.</strong> <br>We will transfer information  about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. We will notify  you in accordance with the procedures contained in the Privacy Statement  Updates and Web Site Maintenance section of this Privacy Statement if your  information will become subject to a different privacy policy.<br><br>

       <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>ACCESS AND OPTIONS</strong></p><br>

      <strong>Opting Out Of Marketing E-mail Messages.</strong> <br>With  your consent, we will send you e-mail offers available to Members. You may  opt-out of receiving marketing e-mail messages from the Web Site either when  you register with the Web Site or at a later date. To opt-out of receiving  e-mail after registration, you may either: <br>1) click on the unsubscribe link at  the bottom of any commercial e-mail you receive and follow the instructions on-screen  (you may do so anytime after receipt of the e-mail),<br>2)<a href="#" title="click here" class="more">click here</a>&nbsp;and choose to stop  receiving e-mail.<br>

      If you are not a registered member of LeadReact, please <a href="#" title="click here" class="more">click here</a> to unsubscribe. Please note that  it may take up to 72 hours for us to process an opt-out request and that any  e-mail communications within the queue prior to your decision to opt-out will  still be sent to you. You will still continue to receive e-mail messages from  other of our company-owned services that you have requested to receive e-mails  from if you opt-out of receiving marketing messages from the LeadReact program.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving e-mail from our other company-owned  services, you need to contact customer support through the applicable service  from which you are requesting to opt-out. On occasion, we may contact you with  specific administrative notices that are required by law, regulation, or as  needed to service your account (i.e. if we update our Privacy Statement). While  you can elect to stop receiving commercial e-mail that we may send from our  participating merchants through the LeadReact program, you cannot unsubscribe  from these administrative messages.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Delete/Deactivate from LeadReact.</strong> <br>You may  stop participating in the LeadReact program at any time and/or delete your  personal information from our database so as not to receive future  communications from the Web Site. In order to deactivate and/or delete your  information from the Web Site’s database, please send an e-mail to info@LeadReact.com  with the words "Cancel My Membership" as the subject line. It may take up to 72  hours for us to process your request and any e-mail communications within the  queue prior to your decision to deactivate will still be sent to you. We also  reserve the right to deactivate a Member at our sole discretion if we believe  that a Member has used the Web Site or e-mail in a way that is fraudulent or  damaging to us, our Clients, or any other third party.<br><br>

      <strong>Delete/Deactivate from Direct Marketing Partners  Mailing Databases.</strong> <br>In order to be deleted from our Direct Marketing  Partner’s databases and to stop receiving direct mail marketing from them, you  must delete your www.LeadReact.com account and cease participation in the  LeadReact program. It generally takes less than 30 days to remove your  information from a Direct Marketing Partner’s list, but in certain instances it  may take up to 60 days.<br>

       <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><br><strong>SECURITY</strong></p> <br>

      We use a secure, encrypted connection (called an SSL connection) on all  pages where you transmit sensitive data such as a credit card number, social  security number or driver’s license number. Additionally, we have implemented  procedural measures to safeguard your information. For example, only a very  limited number of our employees have access to your personal information.<br>

      Despite these security measures, we cannot guarantee that a third party  might not unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private  communications, or that users might not abuse or misuse your personal  information that they may illegally collect from the Web Site. Therefore,  although we believe that our practices exceed industry standard practices to  protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your  personal information or private communications will always remain private.<br><br>

       <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEB SITES</strong></p> <br>

      Through the Web Site, we may provide links to third-party web sites,  such as those of our Clients. Each of these web sites have separate privacy and  data-collection practices, which may differ from this Web Site, and we are not  responsible for the actions or practices of these third parties, nor for the  content on these web sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of  these web sites before providing your personally identifiable information.<br><br>

       <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>DIGITAL IDENTIFIERS</strong></p> <br>

      <strong>Cookies.</strong> We use "cookies" to  personalize the LeadReact program to your interests, to ensure that only you  can access your account, to facilitate the automatic log-in process and for web  beacons (as described below in the "Web Beacons" section). The  primary purpose of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you  time. For example, we use them to store your Automatic Log-in ID so you do not  have to re-enter it each time you visit www.LeadReact.com. A cookie is a text  file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be  used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely  assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued  the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web  browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you  may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of  www.LeadReact.com or the other web sites you visit.<br><br>

      We also review "log-file" data to monitor site performance and  analyze traffic patterns and usage of our Web Site. Each time you visit the Web  Site, our server automatically recognizes the following:

    <ul type="disc">

      <li>Host origin of the request (your IP address or that of your ISP if using proxy servers) </li>

      <li>Referrer URL (the page you came from) </li>

      <li>Requested document (the page you're looking at) </li>

      <li>Your cookie </li>

      <li>Date and time of your visit </li>

    </ul>

    This information, sometimes called log-file, is used to monitor Web Site  performance and ensure that the LeadReact services function properly. It may  also be appended to your personal profile so that we may further tailor the  LeadReact program to your interests. If this data is appended to your personal  file and you choose to share your personal information with a Client, the Client  may also have access to this data.<br><br>

      Web Beacons. The Web Site’s pages and/or HTML e-mails may contain  electronic images (called "web beacons", "single-pixel GIFs", or "action tags")  that allow us to count users who have visited a certain web page or opened an  e-mail, conduct research on partner and Client web sites for auditing purposes,  or to access your www.LeadReact.com "cookie" to identify you when on third  party web sites. Using web beacons allows us to personalize your experience by  tailoring advertisements, updates, and other offers to your particular  interests, and measuring the marketing effectiveness of our e-mail  communications.<br><br>

      Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie  number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which  the web beacon resides. Information recorded through these web beacons may be  used to report aggregate demographic or usage information about Members to our  Clients, or user-level usage information to our Third Party Processors. The Web  Site’s web pages may also contain web beacons placed there by third parties to  help determine the effectiveness of our joint promotional or advertising  campaigns. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with a  Client or Third Party Processors except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy  Statement.<br><br>

  <strong>Third Party Ad Servers.</strong><br> We may serve advertisements  within our Web Site either ourselves or by allowing other companies, called  third-party ad servers or ad networks, to do so. In addition, some of our  advertisers may use the services of third-party ad networks. Some of these  third-party ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing  this allows the third-party ad network to recognize your computer each time  they send you an online advertisement. In this way, third-party ad networks may  compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw  their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information  allows a third-party ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they  believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of  the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or third-party ad  networks. Those third-party ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer  you a way to opt-out of ad targeting. To receive more information on  React2media’s ad server please visit www.adjuggler.com . <br>

  <br>

  <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>CHILDREN/MINORS</strong></p><br>

      The Web Site will automatically block enrollment of any person once they  indicate they are under the age of 13. If we later learn that a user is under  the age of 13, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information.  Inherent in the LeadReact program is the responsibility of parents and/or  guardians to ensure that their children's privacy is protected.<br><br>

  <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</strong></p><br>

      We disclaim and you agree that we will not be liable to you for any  damages caused by acts or events beyond our reasonable control including,  without limitation, acts of God, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, wars, civil  disturbances, sabotage, accidents, labor disputes, governmental actions, and  failures or delays of transportation that result in our disclosure of your  personally identifiable information.<br><br>

  <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>PRIVACY STATEMENT UPDATES AND SITE MAINTENANCE</strong></p><br>

      We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update,  change, modify or revise this Privacy Statement, the Site or our services  simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Site. Any such  addition, update, change, modification or revision will be effective  immediately upon posting. If we materially change how we use your personal  information, we will notify you via e-mail.<br><br>

  <p align="center" style="margin:0px;"><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></p><br>
