<br>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes.  Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.  A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our websites.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  </p>

<h3>WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our websites or while using our services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Personal information.</b> We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share all types of personal information with:</p>
<ul>
<li class="disc_list"><b>Authorized service providers.</b> We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf in connection with your request for real estate brokerage services. These service providers may include marketing and customer services firms, credit card payment processors, as well as companies that support contests, sweepstakes, surveys, or other features offered through our websites, or that provide business analysis or website support. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.</li>
<li class="disc_list"><b>Real estate agents / brokers and home builders.</b> If you submit a Find-a-REALTOR or iNest form, we may share your personal information with real estate agents / brokers or home builders on our network with which you have expressed interest. We will not share information with other real estate agents / brokers or home builders not disclosed to you. Because these parties may retain or use your personal information whether or not you obtain services from them, you should contact these parties directly concerning their privacy and information sharing practices.</li>
<li class="disc_list"><b>Business partners.</b> When you express interest in promotions or services offered through our websites, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes, and, as applicable, their affiliates. When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to the business providing that offer or program.</li>
<li class="disc_list"><b>Other Tree.com,Inc. businesses.</b> We may share information we collect, including personal information, with the other Tree.com, Inc. companies (some of which are nonfinancial companies). Sharing information with the other Tree.com, Inc. companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you. All Tree.com, Inc. companies comply with the Tree.com, Inc. Privacy Policy. The other Tree.com, Inc. companies also will comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages from that company in the future. However, in no circumstance will RealEstate.com / iNest / Domania share with other Tree.com, Inc. companies any personally identifiable information that you provide to us if that information bears on your creditworthiness.</li>
<li class="disc_list"><i><b>Special notice to California residents: RealEstate.com / iNest / Domania will not share any personal information about you with other Tree.com,Inc. companies to the extent prohibited by applicable California law or to the extent your prior consent to share is required by applicable California law.</b></i></li>
<li class="disc_list"><i><b>Special notice to Vermont residents: RealEstate.com / iNest / Domania will not share any personal information about you with other Tree.com,Inc. companies to the extent prohibited by applicable Vermont law or to the extent your prior consent to share is required by applicable Vermont law.</b></i></li>
<li class="disc_list"><b>Other Situations.</b> We also may disclose your information:
<ul>
<li class="circle_list">In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</li>
<li class="circle_list">When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our websites' terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
<li class="circle_list">In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Aggregated and non-personal information.</b> We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and Tree.com,Inc. companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our websites and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Third-party websites.</b> There are a number of places on our websites where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our websites, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li class="disc_list">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our websites because such information may be required in order for you to obtain services from us.</li>
<li class="disc_list">Federal and state regulations require that we store certain customer information for various periods of time. In order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information from our database, until the expiration of the applicable period.</li>
<li class="disc_list">When you initially use our websites, you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive e-mail messages or newsletters from us. You may later modify your choice by contacting our Customer Care Department at 704-944-2110. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as loan offers, requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of promotional e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using our websites to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
