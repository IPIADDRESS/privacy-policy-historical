<strong>More Details</strong>

<ol><li> <strong> Who We Are.</strong> When you visit a LendingTree Web site to request a loan, you will complete one simple loan or realty request. Based on the information you supply, LendingTree will transmit your data to participating lenders who are best suited to meet your financial needs. When you request the services of a real estate professional through a LendingTree Web site, we will transmit your data, including your credit history, to participating real estate brokers to complete your transaction. LendingTree is a computerized loan originator and is licensed or exempt as a mortgage and/or loan broker and real estate broker in most states. See our State Licenses section for additional information. <br><br>

</li><li>  <strong>Information We Collect.</strong><br><br>

Information we receive from you on loan or realty requests. Some of the information you supply to us on the loan or realty request may be optional. If you supply this information, it will not be sold or shared to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you, to participating Lenders, real estate professionals or other parties involved in your transaction, or as may be required by law or court order. <br><br>

<ul><li> <strong>Supplementary information for your loan or realty request. </strong>In order for us to match you with participating Lenders and real estate professionals, we may need to obtain additional data. For example, we may use your name and Social Security Number to request a credit report to help us determine which lenders are best suited to compete for your business.  <br><br>
</li><li> <strong>Information we collect when you use the LendingTree Home Value Estimation Plus.</strong> When you use our Home Value Estimation Plus, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, credit card number, etc. The LendingTree Home Value Estimation Plus is produced with authorized partners who will only use the information specifically to provide you with the detailed information you have requested. Your information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization for marketing purposes.  <br><br>

When you complete a loan or realty request, we store your cookie identification in our system. If you request that we remember you during a loan or realty request, we use this cookie to allow our site to recognize you when you return.<br><br>

Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your request.  <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>Information gathered from Real Estate brokers.</strong> If you are a Real Estate broker and you submit the form requesting more information, your name and other identifying information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization. Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your request.  <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>Information gathered from the "Affiliates" section of a LendingTree Web site.</strong> Information submitted through the "Affiliate" section of our Web sites will be shared with BeFree, our affiliate software provider. BeFree provides the software that enables LendingTree to develop and manage our LendingTree Affiliate Program. LendingTree and BeFree do not sell or share your information with any other person or organization. You can review BeFree's privacy policy at their website<br> [http://www.befree.com/privacy.htm]  <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>You will receive an e-mail from LendingTree indicating whether or not you have been approved to participate in the Affiliate Program.</strong> If approved, we will use your e-mail address to inform you of Affiliate Program news and updates. You may withdraw your membership from the Affiliate Program at any time by sending an e-mail to affiliates@lendingtree.com. If you choose to withdraw, you will not receive any further e-mails regarding the LendingTree Affiliate Program. <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>LendingTree also enrolls affiliates through Commission Junction.</strong> Your affiliate information will only be shared with Commission Junction if you enroll in the LendingTree Affiliate Program through Commission Junction. LendingTree and Commission Junction do not sell or share your information with any other person or organization. You can review Commission Junction's privacy policy at their website <br> [http://www.cj.com/privacy.jsp] <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>If you come to a LendingTree site through an affiliate site, LendingTree will never sell or share your information with that, or any other, affiliate.</strong> All transactions take place on LendingTree's servers. Please see our security page for more information on how we protect the integrity of your data.  <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>Information we collect when you apply for a job at LendingTree.</strong> When you apply for a job through a LendingTree Web site, we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address, etc. This information will not be sold or shared with any person or organization. All data collected will be used for the purposes of evaluating your application for employment. Your e-mail address or telephone number may be used by authorized LendingTree employees to contact you concerning your application.  <br><br></li></ul>

</li><li> <strong>How your information is used.</strong> <br><br>

<ul><li> <strong>Sharing information with our participating Lenders and real estate professionals.</strong> After up to four participating Lenders and/or real estate professionals receive your information, they may contact you directly via phone, e-mail or other communications. All of our Lenders and real estate agents operate under federal and/or state laws and regulations and believe, as we do, that the Internet is an exciting and secure place to do business. If you are matched with any participating Lenders, the Lender with which you choose to close your loan and/or obtain your credit card will report certain information about your loan and/or credit card to LendingTree, and LendingTree will treat that information in the manner it treats the information you provided on your loan or realty request. As our Lenders and real estate professionals may keep and use your information whether or not you qualify for a transaction with them, we recommend that you contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies.  <br><br>

</li><li> <strong>Sharing information with third parties.</strong> Following is an example of how LendingTree may act as an agent for our participating Lenders and real estate professionals. A Lender may instruct us to share information with an appraiser to prepare an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged, with a flood certification provider to determine whether the property lies in a flood plain, or with a prospective secondary market purchaser of the mortgage loan the lender may make. In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Lender, under the authority of the Lender's privacy policy, a copy of which you will receive from the Lender. All of the information-sharing we do as agent for the Lender would be permissible under applicable federal law for the Lender to do directly.<br><br>

From time to time, LendingTree may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. At your request, LendingTree will not send you any information or offers unrelated to your request for financing. If you do not wish to receive any of these offers, please visit our subscription area where you can remove yourself from our mailing list.  <br><br></li></ul>
</li><li> <strong>Altering Information You Submit Through a LendingTree Web Site. </strong><br><br>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Changing your information.</strong> If you want to change the type of loan or make other significant changes to your loan or realty request, you might need to make another request through our Web site. If you wish to change your subscriptions to LendingTree emails, you can visit our subscription page.  <br><br>
</li><li> <strong>Deleting your information.</strong> Even if your loan or realty request was withdrawn, by law, we cannot delete that information. We store all of the information you might provide securely. You can visit our Security section to learn more about how we do this.  <br><br></li></ul>

</li><li> <strong>How Our Policy is Monitored.</strong><br><br>

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Customer Care Department. If we make a change to our Privacy Policy in the future that will affect how we treat your information, we will notify you of the change. In that case, your ability to opt out of the new policy will be determined by applicable laws and we will include that information in our notification. If the change impacts how we use your information, we will notify you even if you have requested that we not contact you. <br><br>
