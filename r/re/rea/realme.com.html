            <p>
                (I)	Without your consent, we will not disclose your information to any third party for its independent marketing or commercial purpose, provided, however, that upon your consent, we can share your information with the following entities to provide you with services:<br>
                1.	Affiliates: your personal data information may be shared with our affiliates. We can only share necessary personal data information, and will be bound by the purpose stated herein. Where the affiliates plan to change the purpose of processing personal data information, we need to further seek for your authorization and consent.<br>
                2.	Sharing with authorized partners: only for the purpose stated herein, some of our services will be provided by the authorized partners. We may share some of your personal data information with the partners to provide better customer services and user experience. Our authorized partners include but are not limited to operators, agents of Realme in different regions, logistics companies, cloud service providers and technical service providers. For example, when you choose to mail the device, we can only arrange delivery or arrange our partners to provide the services after we share your personal data information with the logistics service providers.<br>

In case of transfer of personal information during merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, we will require the new company or organization which has received your personal information to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

            </p>
            <div class="new-main-title legal-main-title">8.	How We Protect Your Personal Information</div>
            <p>
                (I)	We have adopted reasonable practical measures and technical measures to protect the service-related information collected. It should, however, be noted that although we have adopted reasonable measures to protect your information, no website, Internet transfer, computer system or wireless connection is absolutely safe.<br>
                (II) We have used the safety protection measures that are in compliance with the industry standards to protect the personal information provided by you so as to prevent unauthorized access to and public disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss of the information. We will take all reasonable and feasible measures to protect your personal information. We have particularly adopted the following measures:<br>
                1.	We will de-identify your personal information collected to lower the risk of identifying you by other organizations or individuals through the de-identified information. We will use SSL to encrypt many services. We will review the practices in information collection, storage and processing (including physical safety measures) to avoid unauthorized access to various systems.<br>
                2.	Only the employees who need to know this information to process personal information for us, and the personnel who are authorized to process personal information on behalf of their service company can access the personal information. For this purpose, they are required to perform strict contract confidentiality obligations. If they have failed to fulfill their obligations, they may be held liable or fired.<br>
                3.	We attach great importance to your information security. Therefore, we will make great efforts to guarantee your personal information security, and adopt security measures such as security encryption during storage and transmission, so that your information would not be accessed, used or disclosed without authorization. At the same time, the specific content of certain encrypted information are not allowed to access by anyone else, except the user himself.<br>
                4.	We will adopt security measures such as encryption when transmitting and storing your special types of personal information; and before storing personal bioinformation we will take technical measures to process it, such as storing the summary of personal bioinformation only. Our retention period of personal information is the shortest time necessary to achieve the purpose. The personal information will be deleted or anonymized beyond the above storage period.<br>

            <p>
                1.  Our products, websites and services are designed mainly for adults. Children are not allowed to create their own user accounts without the consent of their parents or guardians. For personal information of the children collected with their parents' consent, we will only disclose this information as permissible by law, or with the expressed consent of the parents or guardians, or when it is necessary to do so in order to protect the child concerned. Although local laws and customs have different definitions of children, we regard any person under the age of 14 as a child. <br>
                2.	If we discover that we have collected the personal information of a child without having obtained an expressed and verifiable parental consent, we will attempt to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.                     
            </p>

            <p>
                1.	In principle, the personal information we collected and generated in your country will be stored in your country.<br>
                2.	However, we provide products or services through the resources and servers around the world, which means your personal information, after obtaining your authorization, might be transferred to the jurisdiction beyond the country where you use the product or service, or might be accessed from these jurisdictions.<br>
