        Dynamics Inc. Privacy Policy</strong></span>
   </p><p class="style1"> 1. General Privacy
        Policy Information
      </p><p class="style1"> At Real Social Dynamics,
        we are 100% committed to protecting your privacy. We take online privacy
        seriously. We use state of the art software to protect you ("the customer")
        from electronic fraud and other security issues. We never disclose the
        information to any agencies, nor do we sell the information that we may
        obtain from you. Please read on for more specific details of our privacy
        policy.
      </p><p class="style1">You linked to this
        Privacy Policy via a product website owned by Real Social Dynamics Corporation
        ("brand website"). This policy applies to all online communication with
        Real Social Dynamics owned brands. When you provide us with online information
        through this Website, we respect your privacy. It is important for you
        to understand what information we collect about you during your visit
        and what we do with that information. Please note that your visit to our
        Website is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions
        and that different policies may apply to information that we collect offline.

      </p><p class="style1">At all times, we
        reserve the right to disclose any information, including personally identifiable
        information, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process
        or governmental request; to protect Real Social Dynamics rights or property
        (including without limitation in the event of a transfer of control of
        a Real Social Dynamics company, affiliate, or brand, or substantially
        all of its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk, or for
        credit fraud protection and risk reduction purposes.
      </p><p class="style1"> 2. Information Collection
        and Use
      </p><p class="style1"> When you sign up
        for any programs on the Real Social Dynamics Website, we need to know
        your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. This information allows
        us to establish an individual account for you. When you wish to purchase
        products, we need to know your credit card number and expiration date
        in order to process your transactions. These critical pieces of information
        are only for you to use and will not be given out to anyone else under
        any circumstances. We only collect personally identifiable information
        about you via this Website when you provide it in connection with a request
        for a product, service, or information. For example, if you decide to
        place an order, we will ask you for your delivery and billing address,
        phone number(s), email address, credit card number and its expiration
        date. If you decide to complete a user registration form or survey, we
        may ask you for information such as your contact information (e.g., name,
        e-mail address and mailing address), age group or birth date. When you
        submit your personally identifiable information on this Website, you are
        giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
        information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Real Social Dynamics
        companies may use the information that you provide to fulfill your request
        for a product, information, or other service, or respond to an email or
        other request, as well as to create and deliver to you our newsletters
        or surveys, communications containing product information, usage tips
        or promotions, help improve our website(s) or services, or customize visitors'
        experience at our website(s). We do not share your credit card or other
        account information with unaffiliated third parties unless you authorize
        us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities including,
        but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order. If
        you prefer not to receive email marketing communications from us or from
        third parties, please see Section 8 below. You cannot opt-out of receiving
        communications from Real Social Dynamics (or third parties who may assist
        us) relating to a specific order or request for a product or service.
        If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information
        from you, please do not provide us with any such information.
      </p><p class="style1"> We may also collect,
        store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning
        your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages
        are most popular. Information gathered may be used in aggregate form for
        internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing
        marketing plans. We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally
        identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees and partners.

      </p><p class="style1">This Website is intended
        for adults. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
        under the age of 13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under
        13 believes that the child has provided us with personally identifiable
        information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us at
        <a href="emailto:admin@realsocialdynamics.com">admin@realsocialdynamics.com</a> if they want this information deleted from
        our files so that it is not in retrievable form. If we otherwise obtain
        knowledge that we have personally identifiable information about a child
        under 13 in retrievable form in our files, we will delete that information
        from our existing files so that it is not retrievable.
      </p><p class="style1">3. Ensuring Your
        Security
      </p><p class="style1"> We use the Secure
        Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced security protocol that protects your
        credit card information and ensures secure online ordering. SSL Internet
        connections are encrypted, and thus protect all credit card ordering information,
        including your name, address and credit card number, so no one can read
        it in transit. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls,
        and restrictions on employee access, to safeguard your personal information.

      </p><p class="style1">4. Safe Shopping
        Guarantee
      </p><p class="style1"> We guarantee that
        every online transaction you make will be "100% safe". This means you
        pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result
        of shopping at our online store. It is determined that under the Fair
        Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00
        of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this
        $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00.
        We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit
        card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using
        the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card,
        you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting
        rules and procedures.
      </p><p class="style1"> 5. Technology Utilized

      </p><p class="style1">There are two commonly
        used technologies used on this site, clear gifs and cookies. We use these
        to monitor the performance of the site and to measure it's effectiveness.
        "Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your
        computer's hard drive. We do not use cookies to obtain any personally
        identifying information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
        but you can usually change your browser to prevent this. Please be assured
        that accepting a cookie does not give us access to your computer or personal
        information under any circumstances. If you disable cookies, you may be
        unable to order or use other features of our sites. If you experience
        any problems, please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@realsocialdynamics.com">admin@realsocialdynamics.com</a>.
      </p><p class="style1"> Clear gifs are tiny
        graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and
        are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference
        between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much
        smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear
        gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information but just
        tell us if you may have seen one of our ads online.
      </p><p class="style1">6. Third Parties

      </p><p class="style1">We may rely on other
        companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
        include data analysis firms, customer support specialists, web-hosting
        companies, and fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product
        orders or coordinate mailings). We may share personally identifiable information
        with such third parties as appropriate for them to perform their functions,
        but they may not use such information for any other purpose. We may also
        share personally identifiable information with marketing partners or other
        direct marketers, so they can send you notices about their products or
        services. If you do not want to receive email-marketing communications,
        see section 8 below for opt-out information.
      </p><p class="style1">7. Notification of
        Changes
      </p><p class="style1"> We may revise this
        Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy,
        we will post the revised policy here. As we may make changes at any time
        without notifying you, we suggest that you periodically consult this Privacy
        Policy.
      </p><p class="style1">8. Real Social Dynamics
        Strict Email Policy
      </p><p class="style1"> Real Social Dynamics
        does not send any unsolicited e-mail and strives to adhere to the following
        guidelines as offered by Mail Abuse Prevention Systems (MAPS), LLC., an
        Internet e-mail watchdog association. If you'd like to be excluded from
        this our e-mail list, please <a href="mailto:admin@realsocialdynamics.com">admin@realsocialdynamics.com</a>.
      </p><p class="style1"> Real Social Dynamics
        provides a simple method for subscribers to terminate their subscriptions.
        We have multiple automated "opt-out" functions on our site, and always
        include unsubscribe information in our mailings. Mailings from our lists
        cease promptly once a subscription is terminated.
      </p><p class="style1">Real Social Dynamics
        provides numerous alternative methods for terminating a subscription.
        We provide numerous "out of band" procedures for those who wish to terminate
        their mailing list subscriptions but are either unable or unwilling to
        follow standard automated procedures.
      </p><p class="style1">Real Social Dynamics
        takes numerous steps to prevent use of our mailing list for abusive purposes.
        We take adequate steps to ensure that our lists cannot be used for these
        purposes. We maintain a permanent "exclusion list" of e-mail addresses
        from which all subscription requests are rejected. Addresses are added
        to the exclusion list upon request by the parties entitled to use the
        addresses at issue. The purpose of the exclusion list is to prevent a
        forged subscription of an address by unauthorized third parties.
      </p><p class="style1">Real Social Dynamics
        always uses acquired or rented lists for their original purpose. When
        acquiring or renting verified opt-in lists, we closely examine the terms
        and conditions under which the addresses were originally compiled. We
        independently determine that all recipients have in fact opted-in to the
        type individual mailing that we intend to deliver.
      </p><p class="style1">Real Social Dynamics
        discloses the nature and frequency of mailings that it intends to send.
        We make adequate disclosures about the nature of our mailings, including
        the subject matter and anticipated frequency of messages.
      </p><p class="style1">Real Social Dynamics
        adheres to a strict "One Subscription, One List" Policy. Addresses are
        not added to other lists without fully verified consent of the address
        owner. We never assume that subscribers to our list wants to be added
        to another list.
      </p><p class="style1">9. Your Thoughts
        Count
