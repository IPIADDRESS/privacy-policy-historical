				<h1>RealTravel Privacy Policy</h1>
				
				<p>We at RealTravel, Inc. (or "RealTravel") recognize that your
				  privacy is important to you. We have created this privacy policy to explain
				  our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personally identifiable
				  information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to
				  our web site located at <a href="http://realtravel.com/">RealTravel.com</a>.
				  Please read this policy before providing us with any personal information.
				  In you have any questions about this policy, email us at <a href="mailto:info@realtravel.com">info@realtravel.com</a>.</p>
				<p><strong>Information We Collect </strong></p>
				<p>We collect two basic types of information from our Site. Personally identifiable
				  information is information that is directly associated with a specific
				  person or entity such as a user's name, e-mail address, or information
				  about activities that are directly linked to that person.</p>
				<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information.
				  Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services
				  or user from which individual user identities have been removed. Aggregate
				  data may include anonymous demographic information such as country of origin,
				  citizenship, ZIP code, age, gender, preferences and survey information.
				  In other words, how you use our Site may be collected and combined with
				  information about how others use the Site, but no personal information
				  will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand
				  trends and our user's needs so that we can better consider new features
				  or otherwise tailor our Site.</p>
				<p><strong>Registered and Unregistered Users</strong></p>
				<p>The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose
				  to us is completely at your discretion. Some areas of our Site are accessible
				  without registration of any kind, such as reading reviews and travel journals,
				  and you can browse those areas of our Site. Other areas of our Site require
				  registration in order for you to participate in the services offered. It
				  is not mandatory for you to register and provide information to us, but
				  please realize that in order for us to serve you better or provide particular
				  features such as writing your own reviews and creating travel journals,
				  you will need to provide certain information to access those areas of our
				  Site.</p>
				<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
				<p>We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact
				  with us. For example, when you visit the Site, our systems automatically
				  collect standard user information for all users, including a user's IP
				  address, operating system, and page views. Information may be automatically
				  collected through the use of "cookies." Cookies are data snippets
				  that websites store on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to analyze
				  site use, target ads, store your preferences/passwords (if you've registered)
				  and personalize your experience. You can configure most web browsers to
				  reject cookies or notify you when cookies are placed. You must accept cookies
				  to access realtravel.com as a registered user. Your access provider assigns
				  an IP address to your computer when you use the Internet. We log each IP
				  address that accesses the site, along with referring/destination URLs.
				  We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site
				  and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address
				  complaints and prepare aggregated reports that we share with others. </p>
				<p><strong>Third Party Links and Ad Servers</strong></p>
				<p>We provide links to services provided by third party websites, which may,
				  or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. We also allow other companies,
				  called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements on RealTravel.
				  Ad servers may also use these tools to compile information about where
				  users saw particular advertisements, and to determine which ads were clicked
				  on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the privacy policies
				  of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to
				  read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking
				  directly from RealTravel. </p>
				<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Information </strong></p>
				<p>We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other
				  people or nonaffiliated companies, except when we have your consent to
				  do so, is as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, when
				  required by law, or when permitted to protect our rights or property.</p>
				<p>Business Transfers: Information about our users, including personal information,
				  will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate
				  business to provide the Site or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company
				  assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership
				  in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business
				  assets of the company.</p>
				<p><strong>Security </strong></p>
				<p>RealTravel uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss,
				  misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we
				  make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the realtravel.com
				  website in a secure operating environment that is not available to the
				  public, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we make every
				  effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems,
				  we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from
				  illegally obtaining this information.</p>
				<p>Your account information is accessible online only through the use of
				  a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you
				  must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.
				  You are responsible for all uses of our web site by any person using your
				  password.</p>
				<p><strong>Children's Policy</strong></p>
				<p>RealTravel is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older.
				  All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on RealTravel. </p>
				<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
				<p>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the
				  Web site. We will post our new privacy policy, along with the date of its
				  last revision, prominently so that you will always know what information
				  we gather, how we use that information, and whether we will disclose it
				  to anyone. Please check this Web page for information about revisions to
				  our privacy policy. </p>
