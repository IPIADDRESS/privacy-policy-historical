        <p>Readdle takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_1">Our Privacy Principles</h1>
        <p>We are at the business of making best productivity tools out there and selling them directly to you, our customer. While other companies might base their entire existence on selling their users data, we decided that we will never base our business on activities like this and we are committed to this decision.</p>
        <p>That's why we treat your data very seriously and always try to avoid having access to your data if it is possible by nature of the application or service we provide to you.</p>
        <p>Most of our mobile app products collect only anonymized or personally unidentifiable usage data that help us make our products better. Some products like Spark have access to more information and thus have their own or additional privacy policies. Below you can find more detailed description of information that we collect at Readdle and how we use it. By using any of our products, you accept the terms of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our website or our products.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_2">General Readdle Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Readdle takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy covers how Readdle treats personal information that Readdle collects and receives when you use the Readdle website (“Website”) or products, except Spark and Fluix. If you are using our Spark or Fluix products, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/privacy">Spark Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://fluix.io/privacy-policy">Fluix Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;respectively. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_3">Information Collection and Use</h1>
        <p>Readdle collects information when you use Readdle products or services, when you visit Website pages or the pages of certain Readdle partners. Readdle may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</p>
        <p>Readdle automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Readdle cookie information, and the page you request.</p>
        <p>We may collect additional information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. Also, we receive and store your email when you subscribe to Readdle newsletters and marketing communications.</p>
        <p>You also may provide information, such as reviews, feedback, comments, etc., which may be published or displayed ("<strong>posted</strong>") on public areas of the our Website or our blogs or forum, via our products, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, "<strong>Content</strong>"). Your Content is posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>
        <p>We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email, etc.</p>

        <h1 id="privacy_4">Information Disclosure</h1>
        <p>Readdle does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-affiliated third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates), except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</span></li>
            <li><span>We believe it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Readdle's terms of use, this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by law.</span></li>

    <p class="text">Readdle takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_1">Our Privacy Principles</h1>
    <p class="text">We are at the business of making best productivity tools out there and selling them directly to you, our customer. While other companies might base their entire existence on selling their users data, we decided that we will never base our business on activities like this and we are committed to this decision.</p>
    <p class="text">That's why we treat your data very seriously and always try to avoid having access to your data if it is possible by nature of the application or service we provide to you.</p>
    <p class="text">Most of our mobile app products collect only anonymized or personally unidentifiable usage data that help us make our products better. Some products like Spark have access to more information and thus have their own or additional privacy policies. Below you can find more detailed description of information that we collect at Readdle and how we use it. By using any of our products, you accept the terms of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our website or our products.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_2">General Readdle Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="text">Readdle takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy covers how Readdle treats personal information that Readdle collects and receives when you use the Readdle website (“Website”) or products, except Spark and Fluix. If you are using our Spark or Fluix products, please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/privacy">Spark Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://fluix.io/privacy-policy">Fluix Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;respectively. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_3">Information Collection and Use</h1>
    <p class="text">Readdle collects information when you use Readdle products or services, when you visit Website pages or the pages of certain Readdle partners. Readdle may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</p>
    <p class="text">Readdle automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Readdle cookie information, and the page you request.</p>
    <p class="text">We may collect additional information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. Also, we receive and store your email when you subscribe to Readdle newsletters and marketing communications.</p>
    <p class="text">You also may provide information, such as reviews, feedback, comments, etc., which may be published or displayed ("<strong>posted</strong>") on public areas of the our Website or our blogs or forum, via our products, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, "<strong>Content</strong>"). Your Content is posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p>
    <p class="text">We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the application-specific device identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, mobile network information, location, installed email, etc.</p>

    <h1 id="ip_privacy_4">Information Disclosure</h1>
    <p class="text">Readdle does not rent, sell, or share personally identifiable information about you with non-affiliated third parties (other than our subsidiaries and affiliates), except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</span></li>
        <li><span>We believe it is necessary to share personally identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Readdle's terms of use, this privacy policy, or as otherwise required by law.</span></li>
        <li><span>We believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></li>
        <li><span>We transfer your information in the event a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding and you agree to and do hereby consent to our assignment or transfer of rights to your personal information.</span></li>
