<h2>Where do we store your data?</h2>

<p>We may store and transfer personal information either within or outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). We transfer data in such a way where it is necessary to fulfil:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your requests and requirements in respect of our software and services; and</li>
<li>Certain business functions that we use a third party business partner to provide, which may include the provision of sales and marketing assistance, data analysis and data cleansing services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>

<ul>
<li>By transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;</li>
<li>By using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has within the EEA; or</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>

<p>To keep this privacy policy as short and easy to understand as possible, we have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at <a data-original-title="" href="mailto:privacy@realvnc.com" title="">privacy@realvnc.com</a> for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.</p>

<h2>How long do we retain your data for?</h2>

<p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any accounting or legal requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for the personal information we hold, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the reasons why we handle your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If you require further information about our specific retention periods, please contact us at <a data-original-title="" href="mailto:privacy@realvnc.com" title="">privacy@realvnc.com</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are handling your personal information based on our legitimate interests (as described in the “How do we use your data” section above). If you ask us to stop handling your personal information in this way, we will stop unless we can show you that we have compelling grounds as to why our use of your personal information should continue; or</li>
<li>For marketing purposes. If you ask us to stop handling your personal information on this basis, we will stop.</li>
</ul>
