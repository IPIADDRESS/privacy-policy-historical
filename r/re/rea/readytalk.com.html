		ReadyTalk Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Ecovate Inc. d/b/a ReadyTalk (“ReadyTalk”, "we" or "us") recognize and respect the importance of protecting your privacy. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. The following Policy describes how ReadyTalk collects and uses your personal information and describes your data protection rights, including a right to object to some of the processing which we carry out. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in the “Your rights” section. We recommend that you carefully review this Policy before providing us with your personal information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
			<b>Scope</b><p></p>
<ol>
<li>
					This Policy sets out how we at ReadyTalk process personal information collected or received from you on ReadyTalk’s website www.readytalk.com (the “Website”), personal information we use for marketing purposes, or personal information processed in the course of managing our relationship with our customers. It does not apply to: (a) information our customers collect or receive from you, or (b) personal information processed by ReadyTalk in the course of facilitating the delivery of our products and services to our customers. For this reason, we encourage you to consult the privacy policies on our customers’ websites before disclosing any personal information to them and through those customers´ websites.</li>
<li>
					'You' or 'your', in this Policy, means you as an individual, rather than any legal entity which is our customer (such as your employer) which you may represent when you order a product or service from us via the Website.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
			<b>Information we collect from you</b><p></p>
<p>We may collect the following personal information from you on our Website: your name, company name, title, telephone number and email address that you enter.

We collect information on whether you opened our emails or clicked a link on our email by using web beacons.</p>
</li>
<li>
			<b>How we use personal information</b><p></p>
<p>The purposes for which we collect personal information include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) to provide you information you request, and to give you a customized interactive experience; (b) to measure interest in various ReadyTalk solutions and services; (c) to inform you about new ReadyTalk solutions and services or features and functionalities; and (d) to help us develop new services, solutions or features that meet your needs.

However, should you choose not to provide the information, we may be unable to process a request or display certain content on the Website. We also may occasionally send you push notifications, which you may opt-out of by turning them off at the device level through your settings, and when you download and use our mobile applications, we may automatically collect certain information such as the type of device you use, operating system version and app version.</p>
</li>
<li>
			<b>Information we receive from our customers</b><p></p>
<p>ReadyTalk collects personal information of employees of its customers, which it uses to communicate with and manage its customer relationships.</p>
<p>This personal information is processed under the direction of any of its customers and without a direct contractual relationship with the individuals’ users whose personal data it processes. Therefore, if users have any concerns about how their personal information is processed by ReadyTalk in the course of their use of ReadyTalk services, they should contact their employer.</p>
<p>We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.</p>
<p>ReadyTalk acknowledges that individuals have the right to access their personal information. ReadyTalk has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes as a data processor. If an individual would seek access, or seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, such individual should direct his/her query to their employer (the data controller). If requested to remove data ReadyTalk will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customer for as long as needed to provide services to our customer. ReadyTalk will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
			<b>Use made of personal information and legal basis for this use</b><p></p>
<p>ReadyTalk processes personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>
					As required by us to conduct our business and pursue our, or third parties´ legitimate interests. In particular, we collect, use and store your personal data: (i) to communicate and manage our relationship with our customers; (ii) to maintain contact data about you or a third party (such as, your employer); and (iii) to inform you of products, services, marketing plan and other business related items from ReadyTalk or third parties which may be of interest to you;</li>

<li>
					For purposes which are required by law: in response to requests by government or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have carried out balancing tests for all the data processing we carry out on the basis of our legitimate interests, which we have described under 5(a) above. You can obtain information on any of our balancing tests by contacting us using the details set out later in this Privacy Policy.</p>
