    <ul>
      <li>Partner publishers and authors: Any personal information in your public

      messages. If you read content from a partner publisher or author, the fact
      that you have read that content and how your read it (including the device,
      time, progress, location, and sharing activity) may be shared, on a purely
      anonymous basis, with that publisher or author so that they can track the
      engagement of their content. Similarly, if you publicly comment on any
      readings on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the

      <li>With your consent: We will disclose your personal information if you have
      explicitly agreed that we may do so.</li>

      <li>Users of our API: Readmill has an open API which enables application

      including our public profile information and any public readings, may be
      accessible to these developers. Please bear this in mind when deciding what
      information to publish on your profile.</li>

      <li>Other networks and connected apps: If you choose to connect your Readmill
      account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr,
      Wordpress or Pinterest, you will be sharing certain information with these
      apps or networks. Readmill is not responsible for these other apps or
      networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or
      services that you trust. For information on how to control the information
      that your share, and how to disconnect your account from other networks or
      apps, please see the Connection tab in your profile.</li>

      relating to other users of the Platform in order to create statistical
      information regarding the Platform and its use, which we may then share with
      third parties or make publicly available. However, none of this information
      would include any email address or other contact information, or anything
      that could be used to identify you individually, either online or in real
      life.</li>

      <li>If required by law: We will disclose your personal information if we
      believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to do so by law,
      including in response to a court order, subpoena or other legal demand or
      request.</li>

      <li>To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal information if we
      feel this is necessary in order to protect or defend our legitimate rights
      and interests, or those of our users, employees, directors or shareholders,
      and/or to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and/or the Readmill
      community.</li>

      <li>In the context of a business transfer: We may transfer your personal
      information to any person or company that acquires all or substantially all
      of the assets or business of Readmill, or on a merger of our business, or in
      the event of our insolvency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choice and Control</h2>

    <p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount
    of personal information you provide to us, and the control you have over that
    information.</p>

    <p>It is not necessary for you to provide us with any information in order to
    visit the Website, although certain information will be collected automatically
    by virtue of your visit (as described above). However, if you do decide to
    register a Readmill account, you can control your personal information in the
    following ways.</p>

    <h3>Email preferences</h3>

    <p>Check out the Basics tab within your Settings page on the Website. When you

    down menu.</p>

    <p>From the Basics tab you can tell us:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The email address that you may wish us to use to communicate with
      you.</li>
    </ul>

    account and your use of the Platform.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to unsubscribe from email newsletters and notifications
    (other than essential account notifications) at any time by clicking on the
    link at the end of each email.</p>

    <h3>Sharing with other apps and networks</h3>

    <p>The Connections tab within your Settings on the Website enables you to
    control the information you share with other networks and applications. As well
    as selecting those of your social networks you wish to share to, you can also
    control access to other services and applications to which you have connected
    your Readmill account.</p>

    <p>If you sign up for Readmill using your Facebook account, your Readmill
    account and your Facebook account respectively will be connected automatically.
    Information regarding the public readings, comments and likes that you post on

    want this information shared with Facebook please change your Settings.</p>

    applications before sharing your information with, or connecting your Readmill
    account to, any of these third party sites or applications.</p>

    <h3>Sharing with other users</h3>

    <p>Readmill is a very social place, but if you would prefer to read anonymously

    see your readings, but we will still have access to this information.</p>

    <h3>Sharing with app developers</h3>

    <h3>Deleting your account</h3>

    <p>You can delete your account from the Basics page within your Settings on the
    Website at any time. Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all
    data associated with your account, including the content shared and the usage
    data associated with that content, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.
    You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your
    account before you delete your account.</p>

    <p>Even if you delete your Readmill account, it is possible that your
    information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while
    afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.
    Search engines' caching processes are outside of Readmill’s control and
    therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by
    search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>

    <p>Please note that deleting any Readmill Apps, or any third party apps to
    which your Readmill account is connected, will not delete your Readmill
    account. If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the
    Basics tab in your Settings on the Website. Similarly, if you delete a third
    party app that is connected to your Readmill account over our API, this will
    not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need
    to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how
    to delete your data from that third party app.</p>

    <h2>Access to your data</h2>

    <p>As described above, most of the personal information you provide to us can
    be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your Readmill account. If you
    wish to access, amend or delete any other personal information we hold about
    you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any information that we
    hold about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@readmill.com">support@readmill.com</a></p>

    <p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by
    email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to
    retain some of your personal information in order to satisfy our legal
    obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>

    <p>Readmill is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected,
    stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws. However, from time to
    time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United
    States to (1) maintain a high level of service through companies like New
    Relic, (2) provide useful information to you relating to the app and website
    through services like Campaign Monitor and (3) to consistently improve the
    services and product we offer and you expressly consent to such transfers. You
    should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to
    the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the
    transfer, storage and processing of your personal information in the United
    States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In relation
    to such personal data, we shall take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure
    that it is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Declaration of Consent</h2>

    <p>I hereby give permission for my personal data to be transferred to third
    parties as set forth under this Section for the purpose of conducting the
    services provided by Readmill. I reserve the right to withdraw this consent by
    notifying Readmill in writing or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:support@readmill.com">support@readmill.com</a>), in which
    case Readmill will be obligated to delete my personal data from their and the
    third party’s server within a reasonable period of time.</p>

    <h2>Social Plugins</h2>

    <p>Our website uses the following social plugins (“Plugins”):</p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>Plugin provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook
      Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The
      Plugin is identifiable by a Facebook logo.</li>

      <li>Plugin by the Twitter service, operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St.,
      Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Twitter”). The button can be
      recognized via the “Twitter” or “Follow” sign.</li>

      <li>The content of the Plugin button is sent directly from the relevant
      company (e.g. Facebook) to your browser and integrated via the browser into the
      webpage. This may have the effect of establishing a direct connection between
      your browser and the servers of the respective companies (e.g. Facebook) as
      soon as you visit a page of our website that contains the Plugin. Further or
      more intensive interaction usually occurs when you press the relevant buttons
      (e.g. by clicking “Like” in case of Facebook), especially if you are
      simultaneously logged onto the services of the respective companies. Our own
      website can therefore not influence which data is collected through the
      operation of the Plugins.</li>

      <li>For further information on the collection and processing and use of
      Personal Data by the respective companies, please visit their websites and view
      their privacy policies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Children</h2>

    <p>Readmill is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is
    not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account
    or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any
    personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them
    to register an account. If it comes to our attention that we have collected
    personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this
    information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may
    have collected any such data, please notify us immediately at
    <a href="mailto:support@readmill.com">support@readmill.com</a></p>

    <h2>Access to Information</h2>

    <p>Under EU data protection legislation, you have the right to access
    information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance
    with the legislation. Any access request may be subject to a fee of 10 EUR
    to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold
    about you.</p>

    <h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will
    also revise the Effective Date set out below. Any changes to our Privacy Policy
    will always be available here so that Readmill users are always aware of what
    information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please
    be sure to check back here from time to time to ensure that you are aware of
    any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy
    will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account
    and/or by posting a notice of the change on the Website.</p>

    <p>If you have any more questions regarding privacy and data, please contact
    our team at <a href="mailto:support@readmill.com">support@readmill.com</a> or send us
    a tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/readmill">@readmill</a>.</p>
