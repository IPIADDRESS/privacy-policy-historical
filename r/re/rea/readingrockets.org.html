<font class="articletitle">Reading Rockets Privacy Policy</font>

<p>Protecting the privacy of our web site visitors is very important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want to make sure you understand the ways in which we may and may not use the information you transmit to us when you visit Reading Rockets. This statement discloses the privacy practices for all WETA Web sites.</p> 
<p>The information gathered by Reading Rockets falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to Reading Rockets and (2) tracking information routinely gathered as visitors navigate through our site.</p>

<h2>Voluntarily-Supplied Information:</h2>

<p>To make use of certain features on Reading Rockets you need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you. Reading Rockets does not collect any personally-identifying information unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>

<p>The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. For example, we can't offer you subscription to electronic newsletters. And we can't send you email alerting you to any new service we're offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you don't tell us your preferences and give us your email address. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without registration.</p>

<p>The areas of the site in which we collect information, the information collected and the purpose for collecting that information are described below:</p>

<p><b>Subscription to electronic newsletters and online events</b><br>
Reading Rockets offers free electronic newsletters to users. The newsletters include highlights of 
Reading Rockets web site content and other news of interest. Reading Rockets also offers 
occasional online discussion events. To sign up, you must provide your email address, first and 
last name, and you must choose a password. Other information is optional. To remove yourself from 
any of the mailing lists, you can sign in using your email address and password and unsubscribe.
</p>

<p><b>Posting to bulletin boards or using online surveys</b><br>
To use Reading Rockets' message boards you must register with a unique username. This username and posts made under that username are not correlated to any personally-identifying information collected elsewhere in the site.</p>

<p><b>Sending email to "Ask Reading Rockets"</b><br>
As a public service, the Reading Rockets staff responds personally to e-mails we receive through 
"Ask Reading Rockets." Questions are answered by experts who are up-to-date on the latest reading 
research and knowledgeable about the practical challenges facing parents and teachers. You'll 
receive a response in a few days and correspondence will remain confidential and will not be 
posted or used in any other way. To send email to Reading Rockets through the "Ask Reading 
Rockets" page, you must enter a name and email address, and of course, your question. 
This information is used to respond to your question, and in aggregate form for 
statistical purposes.</p> 

<p><b>Sending feedback to Reading Rockets through the "Contact Us" page</b><br>
To send email to Reading Rockets through the "Contact Us" page, you must enter a name 
and email address, and of course, your comments. This information is used to respond to your comments, and in aggregate form 
for statistical purposes.</p> 

<p>Visitors under the age of 18 must obtain permission from their parents or guardians before sending any personally-identifying information to Reading Rockets.</p>

<h2>Tracking Information:</h2>

<p>Reading Rockets' Web server automatically collects and logs limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet when you visit our site. The information collected in these log files allows us to make our site more useful to our visitors. The access logs do NOT record your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they contain some or all of the following information:</p> 

<ul type="square">
<li><span class="normal">"The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the machine you used to access our Web site*</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">The date and time you visited</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">The pages you visited on our site</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">The brand and version of browser you used, and the type of computer you used.</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">A list of files you downloaded or viewed</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">The amount of time you spent viewing or listening to streaming media files</span> 
</li><li><span class="normal">Any errors you encountered</span> 
</li></ul>

<p>*Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data. Your IP address does not identify you personally. Most Internet Service Providers use a "dynamic" form of assigning IP Addresses. This means that you may have a different IP Address each time you visit Reading Rockets. Also, many Internet Service Providers, including America Online, use "Proxy servers" which provide even more anonymity for visitors. For example, all visitors accessing Reading Rockets through America Online will be recorded in our access logs as having the same IP Address.</p>

<h2>About Cookies:</h2>

<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive, and our cookie can't read the cookie files created by other sites. Our sponsors may also assign their own cookies to your browser to track which ads you have viewed, a process that we don't control.</p>

<p>We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows you to post messages in the Bulletin Boards area without having to login and give your password every time you come back, even if you've been away for awhile. We may also use cookies to track the pages on our site visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often.</p>

<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies enabled to use Reading Rockets. However, some features of our site will not work properly if you refuse cookies.</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Sites Beyond Reading Rockets:</h2>

<p>To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Features such as our Store, for example, are made available through an affiliate arrangement with Amazon.com. And, of course, our site includes links to plenty of other web sites whose privacy policies we don't control. Once you leave our server (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.</p>

<h2>Acceptance of the Reading Rockets Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>By using this site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Reading Rockets Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of Reading Rockets following the posting of any changes to these terms shall mean that you have accepted those changes. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.</p>
