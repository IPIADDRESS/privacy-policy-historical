Origin is still very much a work in progress, as you'd expect for a piece of software or platform that launched only a few months ago. Despite the short time it's been around, an impressive number of people are already using it on a daily basis according to Electronic Arts.

In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, EA's new COO, Peter Moore, talked about the position Origin currently is in. He recently delivered a keynote at the EB Games Expo, during which a heckler in the crowd shouted about how Origin &quot;sucks.&quot;">Origin Used by 5 Million People Daily, Claims  ...</a></li>

So good news, casual fans: EA is working on a new NFL Blitz to keep the pick-up-and-play spirit alive. It's currently scheduled to release on January 3, 2012.EGM reports that the new NFL Blitz is much more arcade than its simulation cousin, switching to 30-yard first downs and 2-minute quarters. Players make leaps and lunges to tackle and cross the goal line, and the game does away with penalties and injuries. Each team is also getting its own special play, like the New York Giants' &quot;Big Apple&quot; play.The game adds a Blitz Gauntlet mode, in which you take on several teams in a row. This unlocks special character teams like Zombies, Spartans, Hot Dogs, and Big Foot. We even see 50s-era sci-fi robots in the trailer. You can also customize your roster by purchasing packs of football cards using Blitz Bucks, a currency earned from playing in different modes like Gauntlet. These packs include new players, so if you get a great player you can slip him in your team regardless of his actual affiliation. Finally, power-ups help add special abilities for your players.The game looks vaguely reminiscent of Madden NFL Arcade, though a bit more fleshed out.

Constant worries over zoning minutiae and travel distances can turn the fun of building a city into a micro-management nightmare.  While there are gamers for whom poring over every detail is the fun part, they are a niche market - a somewhat under served niche market in this age of first-person shooter epics and real-time strategy extravaganzas.  It is a good thing the Tropico franchise is here to inject some life (and humor and color) into the genre.&quot;">Gaming Nexus: Tropico 4 Review</a></li>

3DS owners are getting not only Monster Hunter 3G, but Monster Hunter 4 as well. The latter is further off which will make 3G (or Tri-G) a more attractive purchase in the meantime, particularly in Japan where the series is incredibly popular. Unfortunately, while the game will support the new Frakenstick attachment for 3DS, it won't make use of the system's networking capabilities for online multiplayer.

The lack of online play was confirmed on a Japanese Capcom support page, as reported by Andriasang. It states multiplayer can only be played with those close enough for a local connection to be made, though online support is included that allows for content to be downloaded such as new event quests.">Monster Hunter 3G Ditches Online Multiplayer o ...</a></li>

They pledge that the information you enter will not be shared with any outside party without your expressed consent (does not include fraud cases) and that any emails you receive from them will be related to your order. However, either CLICKBANK or PAYPAL are not the owner for this services, it's just a partner and billing processor. The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on REALPOOR.COM.

        </h3>
        <p>
        We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
        </p><h3>

        </h3>
        <p>
        This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages. We do not, as a rule, monitor members' private message exchanges, but we reserve the right to do so if user is using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Act.

        WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE?
        </h3>
        <p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
        </p><p>
REALPOOR.COM follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
