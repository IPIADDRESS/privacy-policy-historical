Capcom has revealed that they'll release a new downloadable double-pack in April titled Final Fight: Double Impact, which will feature the return of their classic arcade beat-em-up Final Fight as well as their side-scrolling fantasy-tinged beat-em-up Magic Sword (via IGN).
Although details are scarce, it sounds like both games will be receiving an HD graphics boost similar to Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, as IGN's tipster said the release will feature both classic visuals and a new visual mode that'll &quot;make the games shine in crisp and clear HD glory.&quot; Both games will also support leaderboards, and best of all, drop-in online co-op.

With the first game appearing in 1995, the Command &amp; Conquer series is one of the longest running RTS franchises in the business. And with Might &amp; Magic creator Jon Van Caneghem recently brought in to take control of the series, it looks like Command &amp; Conquer is taking a radical new direction -- with a strong online focus.
&quot;Direct-to-consumer is where I think most games are going, and I've always been a fan of the [C&amp;C] series,&quot; Caneghem said to Gamasutra. &quot;[EA] has the same vision I do on the future of games and the future of this franchise, so I think it's going be great.&quot;
That future, specifically, is to make the next Command &amp; Conquer more about online connectivity with stronger social network aspects, which is a strategy that &quot;no one's ever done before&quot; with an RTS, Caneghem said.">EALA Plans More Social Connectivity for Comman ...</a></li>

        </h3>
        <p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
