Curious what Telltale has in store for Marty McFly and friends? USA Today's Game Hunters blog snagged some early details on the upcoming Back to the Future games from the Sam &amp; Max developer.

The USA Today article confirms that 71-year-old Christopher Lloyd is set to reprise his role as Doc Brown in Telltale's episodic series. Original Back to the Future trilogy screenwriter Bob Gale is also on board to work on the plot for all five of the planned episodes.

Expect plenty of references to the films, including the DeLorean, Hill Valley, and even characters modeled after the original actors. But don't hold your breath for a Michael J. Fox voiceover; the man who was McFly has yet to be confirmed for Telltale's games.">Christopher Lloyd Confirmed for Back to the Fu ...</a></li>

        We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
        </p><h3>
        CAN I CHANGE THE INFORMATION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU?
        </h3>
        <p>
        You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "Profile" from the main menu on the site.

        DO YOU MONITOR ONLINE BEHAVIOR?
        </h3>
        <p>
        This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages. We do not, as a rule, monitor members' private message exchanges, but we reserve the right to do so if user is using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Act. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.

        WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE?
        </h3>
        <p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
        </p><p>
REALPOOR.COM follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
