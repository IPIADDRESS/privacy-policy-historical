Halo 2, the game that launched the studio into triple-A status and made headlines worldwide, will no longer be playable online.    Bungie reacted as you might expected: they were bummed out but thankful for the fans.    Fans were much more vocal about their disappointment, however, taking to the official Halo 2 forums on Bungie's website to swap memories about their time spent battling each other online.    &amp;quot;Damn, I wanna cry, Halo 2 is the reason I'm aiming to design game sin the future,&amp;quot; said Sonic343.">Bungie "Saddened" By Xbox Live Disconnection N ...</a></li>

With Xbox Live support for original Xbox titles set to be discontinued on April 15, the online multiplayer of Bungie's beloved Halo 2 doesn't have much time left. On April 15, all original Xbox games will no longer be able to access Live (whether played on an original Xbox or an Xbox 360). The reasoning behind the decision is to allow Xbox Live to continue to evolve in ways that are currently restricted by the ongoing support of original Xbox games. But as a result, unless you pick up a copy of Halo 2 on PC, the last opportunity to play the game online will be on April 14 -- and Bungie is planning on having the game go out with a bang.

Details will be revealed in the upcoming weeks, but a post on Bungie.net tells fans to &quot;mark your calendars now - on April 14th let's all rally to go online for one last hoorah.&quot; It'll be &quot;[o]ne final farewell and one final opportunity for all of you to kick our asses at Halo 2.&quot;

Beyond Bungie staff joining in on the fun online, your guess is as good as any as to what else they have in store for Halo 2's last day online. Whatever it is, the game will have had a hell of a six-and-a-half year run.

If your passion for Danish building toys and space operas hasn't been satisfied by the other Lego Star Wars titles, Traveller's Tales is ready and more than willing to give you another. Today the company announced Lego Star Wars 3: The Clone Wars, based on the popular Cartoon Network animated TV series. The game is set for Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, DS, and PC this fall. The company promises characters from both seasons of the series, along with cameos from the movie characters. TT is working to make this game an improvement over previous installments with an enhanced level builder, Jedi and Separatist factions, and new attacks and abilities.



&quot;LucasArts is an amazing partner, and working with them on the next iteration of the Lego Star Wars continues to be a great experience,&quot; said TT Games director Tom Stone in the press release. &quot;The team at TT is working hard at making this simply the best Lego game ever with all new gameplay and features never before seen in a Lego game.&quot;



While TT Games has made two Lego Star Wars games (and one compilation) in the past, we may see a shift in the art assets for this installment. The games have always been based on the actual Lego sets, and sets produced for the Clone Wars television series have had a stylized look to more closely resemble the cartoon (above). All the same, we can't help but wonder if this installment is destined to eventually be bundled with the other two existing games. They could call it, &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, For Reals This Time.&quot; 	">TT Games Announces Lego Star Wars 3: The Clone ...</a></li>

        <p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
