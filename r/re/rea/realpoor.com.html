1UP COVER STORY


	
	
    
	
    1UP COVER STORY | WEEK OF JUNE 25 | VIDEO GAME MUSIC FESTIVAL
    
	Aerosmith Can't Catch a Break
	Cover Story: The surprisingly long chronology of the famous band's roles in video games.
	
	
	
	
	
	
Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, Joe Perry, Brad Whitford, and Steven Tyler -- Aerosmith, one of the most prolific American rock bands that's still around today. Believe it or not, Aerosmith has been around video games in one way or another for almost 20 years. For a group of rapidly aging rockers who didn't really project a love of video games, they were oddly willing to be in them. Sure, tons of popular music acts have their songs licensed for use in games, but as an in-the-flesh band, Aerosmith has had more game appearances than you'd think. It's just that none of them were very dignified.

In the event that you decide to buy one of our products or services, you will be asked for your financial information (like credit card number) which cannot be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". We are using CLICKBANK &amp; PAYPAL for billing purposes. They pledge that the information you enter will not be shared with any outside party without your expressed consent (does not include fraud cases) and that any emails you receive from them will be related to your order. However, either CLICKBANK or PAYPAL are not the owner for this services, it's just a partner and billing processor. The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never release your personally identifiable information to an external organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on REALPOOR.COM.

        HOW LONG DO YOU KEEP THE INFORMATION I'VE GIVEN YOU?
        </h3>
        <p>
        We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is longer.
        </p><h3>
        CAN I CHANGE THE INFORMATION I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU?
        </h3>
        <p>
        You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected and change your registration information by selecting "Profile" from the main menu on the site.
        </p><h3>
        DO YOU MONITOR ONLINE BEHAVIOR?
        </h3>
        <p>
        This is a community site where the members communicate to share the information using our forums. Also our members communicate with each other through instant private messages. We do not, as a rule, monitor members' private message exchanges, but we reserve the right to do so if user is using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Act. Member submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.

        </p><h3>
        WHAT SECURITY FEATURES DO YOU HAVE?
        </h3>
        <p>
The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, our payment processors encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). SSL is the leading security protocol on the Internet. It ensures that information being transferred over the network is private through a process called encryption. Once encrypted the information is an unintelligible code until it is decoded upon arrival at the authorized destination.
        </p><p>
REALPOOR.COM follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
