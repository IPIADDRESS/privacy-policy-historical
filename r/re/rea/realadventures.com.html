			<hr color="#800000"><br>

      <h3><b><a name="share">With whom is the information shared?</a></b> </h3>

      <h3><b><a name="choice">What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?</a></b> </h3>

			Cedora, Inc. uses cookies to help us better understand how our site is accessed and utilized. The cookies do not contain any personal information about you. We place the date, time and a unique identifier in the cookie that we create and place on your hard drive. If you prefer not to have these cookies installed on your hard drive, you may be able to change the cookie settings of your browser. Most browsers provide users with options to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you will still be able to use the Cedora, Inc. site. But, by doing so, we will not be able to present you with a personalized version of our site that reflects your style, preferences and tastes.<br><br>

			<b>Visitors:</b> If you sign up to receive our Travel Newsletter, you will be providing us with some personal information to help us tailor the newsletter and promotional e-mail messages to your interests and needs. Your information is <b>never</b> sold, rented or distributed to others.<br><br>

			<b>Listing Partners:</b> If you add your listing to the Cedora, Inc. website, you are doing so with the understanding that the information will be available through our search engines to all visitors.

			<hr color="#800000"><br>

      <h3><b><a name="security">What security precautions are used to prevent unauthorized access or updates to my information?</a></b></h3>

			All information collected for our Travel Newsletter, promotional e-mails or listing information is assigned a unique number along with a user specified password. Only you and the Cedora, Inc. staff have access to this information. We recommend using a 'complex' password that is difficult to guess. Complex password include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and/ or punctuation (Examples: Apple.Sauce, Telephone.Antenna, USA34John). If the correct password is not entered within three attempts, the information will be locked until Cedora, Inc. is contacted with identifying information.<br><br>

			Do not reveal your account number, listing number or password to anyone. This will ensure that others will not be able to access or update your information.<br><br>

			While most companies and individuals access the Internet for legitimate personal and business reasons, there are some who seek to gain access to or corrupt private information. They may attempt to do this by intercepting data transmissions or hacking at your password. We cannot prevent security breaches of this nature. But we will make every effort to ensure data privacy, security and integrity once we receive it.<br><br>

      <hr color="#800000"><br>

      <h3><b><a name="else">What else should I know about my privacy?</a></b></h3>

      Any personal information that you reveal while surfing the Internet (through on-line forms, message boards, chat rooms, e-mail messages, etc) can potentially be collected and used by others. As a result, you may receive unsolicited e-mail messages or phone calls.<br><br>

			Protection of personal or professional information, e-mail addresses and passwords is ultimately your  responsibility.</span><br><br>
