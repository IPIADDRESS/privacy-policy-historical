			<hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="how">How is the information used?</a></b> </h3>

      <hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="who">Who is collecting information?</a></b></h3>
			
      <p>While visiting the Real Adventures web site, the information we collect is used strictly by Real Adventures, unless specifically stated otherwise. For some services, we may share your information with an affiliate or partner to enhance the service we offer to you. Any information we share with others is done under strict confidentiality and privacy agreements.</p>
			
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> Advertisers and listors on the Real Adventures site may have links to their or other sites. The information that they collect and how it is used is not covered by this privacy policy. Please refer to the privacy policies on their web sites.</p>

			<hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="share">With whom is the information shared?</a></b> </h3>
			
			<p>Real Adventures does not share any information collected about you, unless you specifically agreed to or as required to by law. If information is shared with others, it is done under strict confidentiality and privacy agreements.</p>
			
			<p><b>NOTE:</b> Real Adventures may also disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Real Adventures' rights or property, other Real Adventures' visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Real Adventures may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. </p>
			
      <hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="choice">What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</a></b> </h3>
			
			<p>Real Adventures uses cookies to help us better understand how our site is accessed and utilized. The cookies do not contain any personal information about you. We place the date, time and a unique identifier in the cookie that we create and place on your hard drive. If you prefer not to have these cookies installed on your hard drive, you may be able to change the cookie settings of your browser. Most browsers provide you with options to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies you will still be able to use the Real Adventures site. But by doing so, we will not be able to present you with a personalized version of our site that reflects your style, preferences and tastes.</p>
			
			<p><b>Visitors:</b> If you sign up to receive promotional e-mails, you will be providing us with some personal information to help us tailor the e-mail's to your interests and needs. Only if you authorize us to do so, will your information be shared with affiliates and advertisers, but then under strict confidentiality and privacy agreements. Typically, only your e-mail address will be shared. You can change your personal information at any time.</p>
			
			<p><b>Listing Owners/Managers:</b> If you add your listing to the Real Adventures web site, you are doing so with the understanding that the information will be available through our search engines to all visitors. In addition, if you authorize us to, we may share some of your listing information with other advertisers. You can change this authorization at any time.</p>
			
      <hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="update">How can I update, correct, or delete my personal information?</a></b> </h3>
			
      <p><b>Visitors:</b> If you have signed up to receive promotional e-mails, you may update your personal information at any time. At this time you can not delete your record.</p>
			
      <p><b>Listing Owners/Managers:</b> You can update your information at any time. Changes made to the listing information will be reflected immediately when a visitor displays or searches for your listing. At this time you cannot delete a listing, but you can make it inactive. Making a listing inactive means that visitors will not be able to search for or display it. You will still have the ability to update and reactive the listing at any time.</p>

			<hr color="#800000"><br>

      <h3><b><a name="security">What security precautions are used to prevent unauthorized access or updates to my information?</a></b></h3>
			
			<p>All information collected for promotional e-mails or listings information are assigned a unique number along with a user specified password. Only you and Real Adventures staff have access to this information. We recommend using a 'complex' password that is difficult to guess. Complex password include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and/or punctuation. Examples: Apple.Sauce, Telephone.Antenna, USA34John. If the correct password is not entered within three attempts that record will be locked until Real Adventures is connected with identifing information.</p>
			
			<p>Do not reveal your account number, listing number or password to anyone. This will ensure that others will not be able to access or update your information. Real Adventures does not update listing or personal information.</p>
			
			<p>While most companies and individuals access the Internet for legitimate personal and business reasons, there are some who seek to gain access to or corrupt private information. They may attempt to do this by intercepting data transmissions or hacking at your password. We cannot prevent security breaches of this nature. But we will make every effort to ensure data privacy, security and integrity once we receive it.</p>
			
      <hr color="#800000"><br>
			
      <h3><b><a name="else">What else should I know about my privacy?</a></b></h3>
			
      <p>Any personal information that you reveal while surfing the internet (through on-line forms, message boards, chat rooms, e-mail messages, etc) can potentially be collected and used by others. As a result, you may receive unsolicited e-mail messages or phone calls.</p>
			
			<p>Protection of personal or professional information, e-mail addresses and passwords is ultimately your  responsibility.</p>
			
      <hr color="#800000"><br>
