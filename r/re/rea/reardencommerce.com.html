			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Rearden Commerce ("Rearden Commerce") knows that you care about
			  how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy
			  seriously. This policy describes the types of information collected, how
			  it may and may not be used, and how it is protected. By visiting Rearden
			  Comerce's website ("Website"), or using any of our services on
			  the website ("Website Services"), you acknowledge that you accept
			  the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and our use of
			  your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h2>Information Collected From Users</h2>
			<p>In the course of your browsing the Website, Rearden Commerce may collect
			  the IP/URL address of the computer through which your visit is enabled (for
			  example your Internet Service Provider's server); cookie information; information
			  regarding the pages, links, banners, icons and other parts of the Website
			  that are accessed or clicked on during a visit to the Website; information
			  regarding the date, time, and duration of your visit; and information you

			  Upon any registration for, and in subsequent interaction with, Website Services,
			  Rearden Commerce may collect mandatory information such as your User Name,
			  Password, primary email address, and password hint question and answer.
			  A "cookie" is a small line of text that is sent to your browser
			  and stored on your computer when you visit a website. Rearden Commerce uses
			  a cookie for record-keeping and verification purposes and a cookie helps
			  us provide better service to you. For example, we use a cookie to verify
			  your session and user identification and to track the pages within the Website
			  that you visited. Your browser should have options to accept, reject or
			  provide you with a notice when a cookie is sent. However, if you disable
			  cookies, you may not be able to use the Website Services. Please note that
			  Rearden Commerce does not and cannot read cookies set by other websites.</p>
			<h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>
			<p>Rearden Commerce collects user information to create a personalized experience
			  for you and to fulfill any service requests. Once this information is collected,
			  you are not anonymous to us; however, this information will not be shared
			  with any third parties except as explained below. Rearden Commerce will
			  not place your name, email address, physical address or any other personally
			  identifiable information into any marketing, promotional database, or mailing
			  list.</p>
			<h2>Sharing of Information Collected:</h2>
			<ul>
              <li>Sharing Aggregated Information and Personal Information of
                Users<br>
                As part of our business, we may pass to our service partners
                and resellers aggregated information (data gathered up across
                multiple or all user accounts) regarding visitors, users, and
                historical transactions in a manner that will not personally
                identify any individual user. We may aggregate personal information
                and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable
                manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing
                and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do
                not disclose to these entities any information that could be
                used to identify you personally.</li>
			  <li>Other Restrictions and Disclosures<br>
			    We will not sell, rent or transfer your Personally Identifiable
			      Information to any third party, unless we are required by law, court
			      order or regulation, or we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply
			      with law or legal process, or to cooperate with local or federal authorities,
			      or to protect or defend against fraud, misuse of the Rearden Commerce
			      Website, breach of any of your obligations hereunder, or to protect
			      our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may disclose your
			      Personally Identifiable Information in connection with a merger, acquisition,
			      or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Rearden Commerce
			      to another company (an "Acquirer Company"), provided that
			      such Personally Identifiable Information shall only be used by the Acquirer
			      Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy
			      Policy. Rearden Commerce will not send email to user's accounts with
			      non service-related emails. Rearden Commerce will not track your Internet
			      usage outside of the confines of the Rearden Commerce Website. Once
			      a user exits the Website, Rearden Commerce will not track your web browsing
			      behavior.</li>
		  </ul>
			<h2>Security of Information</h2>
			<p>Rearden Commerce uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality
			  of your Personally Identifiable Information, including the use of encryption,
			  firewalls, and Secure Socket Layers. In an effort to protect all data against
			  loss and unauthorized access, we employ many different security techniques
			  to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside
			  the company including regulating the physical and virtual access to any
			  root access, database(s), servers, back-ups, encryption keys or other network
			  and security-related infrastructure components. In addition, sensitive information
			  such as passwords are encrypted before being stored in our systems such
			  that even if a breach were to occur and access to the data achieved, the
			  data would still be encrypted. Please be aware that while we take efforts
			  to safeguard your user information, "perfect security" does not
			  exist on the Internet.</p>
			<h2>Third Party Sites</h2>
			<p>Rearden Commerce does not control the privacy policies of third party sites
			  or service providers to which we provide links, if any. Please be aware
			  that if you click on an advertisement or third party link, you will be subject
			  to the third party's privacy policy.</p>

			  the policy has been modified since you last reviewed it. Your continued
			  use of any portion of the Website or Rearden Commerce service following
