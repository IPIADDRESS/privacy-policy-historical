Information Technology“Generals always fight the last war” said General George Patton. That’s why new methods like chemical, tanks, blitzkrieg, and A-bombs had such devastating effects when first used. The world knows the U.S. military cannot be defeated in combat. So a new series of methods have already been developed that are much more dangerous than a dirty bomb or nuking a few cities. Future warfare will target entire nation’s Electrical Grid via Physical, Cyber, and EMP attacks. Even previously small threats like N.

Construction of the Country Living Grain Mill is strong cast metal alloy with super tough powder coat finish that won't chip or peel from anything short of severe abuse. It's a very nice mill to use and a handsome piece of equipment with clean, functional lines and beautiful raised wheat heads on the side panels.&nbsp;
Engineered for Quality Grinding: The grinding burrs for the Country Living Mill are precision-engineered, made of high carbon steel (not lower-grade iron) and are a massive 5&quot; in diameter.&nbsp; Flour remains cool in the Country Living Mill, so nutrient quality is preserved. The precision fit of the burr faces also means turning effort is unusually easy for a hand operated mill, particularly with the optional handle-length extension. The Country Living Mill produces 1 cup of wheat flour in about 1-1/4 minutes (grinding rate is a little slower if you use the optional Power Bar handle extension.) The grind is infinitely adjustable, so you can crack grain at a loose setting or crank it down and get extremely fine whole grain flour in a single pass. The Country Living Grain Mill is unexcelled in its ability to combine moderate turning effort, yet produce very fine flour — or a coarser meal texture, depending on your needs.

Herbal medicines are only as effective as the quality of the herbs from  which they are made. When Ed Smith and Sara Katz founded Herb Pharm in  1979 they understood as herbalists this basic principle and have never  compromised in their efforts to provide the highest quality, most  effective whole-herb healthcare products possible. They know that  producing effective herbal extracts that enable people to affect  positive changes in the quality of their health is based on diligent  study and understanding of traditional herbal medicine, as well as  modern herbal sciences.Certified Organic Herbs
At Herb Pharm we grow most of our herbs on our own certified organic  farm which is only two miles from our modern manufacturing facility.  This enables us to control every aspect of production: from the soil and  seed, to the herb extraction, to the finished product shipped to our  customers. We hand-harvest our herbs at their peak of potency and within  minutes deliver them, fresh and succulent, to our manufacturing  facility for prompt extraction. For those herbs that we can't grow  ourselves, we purchase directly from other certified organic herb farms  whose owners we know personally and trust.Custom Wildcrafted™ Herbs
Some of the herbs we use are harvested in their natural wild habitat. We  either harvest these herbs ourselves or purchase directly from  wildcrafters who meet our demanding standards of quality. This allows us  to specify exact harvesting methods that assure the sustainability of  these valuable plants. This is what we mean when we say our wild herbs  are Custom Wildcrafted™.Optimal Extraction of the Whole Herb
We extract each herb according to its own unique physical and  biochemical characteristics. This attention to detail produces a  finished extract that optimally represents the herb from which it is  made. Our extracts are very rich in the aroma, taste and bioactive  compounds of the original herbs themselves.Broad-Spectrum Liquid Herbal Extracts
After 30-plus years of working with herbs, we remain convinced that  broad-spectrum liquid herbal extracts are the most potent and effective  way to take herbal medicine. They are easily and optimally absorbed and  assimilated by the body, and therefore their health-promoting effects  are promptly felt. We also offer several herbal capsule products that we  produce from our liquid herbal extracts in order to assure this same  efficiency of absorption and assimilation.">HERBAL EXTRACTS <span class="count">(169)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-806"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/med-supplies-kits/homeopathic-supplies/">HOMEOPATHIC SUPPLIES <span class="count">(20)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-890"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/med-supplies-kits/medical-sterilizers/" title="The All                  American Non Electric SterilizerS provides dry sterile dressings                  and instruments, with all bacteria and micro-organisms destroyed,                  in a matter of minutes.

THE ADAMS ARMS DIFFERENCE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revolutionary Retro-Fit Piston System is designed to convert your standard direct impingement rifle to a clean, cool, reliable system without extensive modifications. Our patented piston system is a drop-in system that works on any mil-spec AR-15 and is compatible with most standard AR-15 parts. Our kits have been treated by various coating applications to increase Durability, Lubricity, and Longevity, and come with a Lifetime Warranty.The Adams Arms Retro-Fit Piston Drive System uses the same gas port on the barrel to work the action of our inverted piston. Instead of directing the gases into the receiver, they go into a gas plug and drive rod sleeve invented by Adams Arms. The gases are contained inside the drive rod sleeve and push the bolt carrier rearward using the gas pressure to cycle the action.Adams Arms proprietary operating systems mechanically actuate the bolt carrier external of the receiver. This keeps the internal receiver and all the critical moving parts clean and free from heat and carbon build up.Here are some of the main differences when using the Adams Arms Operating System:Short Stroke Free Floating Piston System
Self Cleaning
Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from the operator
Bolt Carrier Group and other critical components remain cool and clean
Corrosive resistant coating processes
Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel
Adjustable gas settings for various applications
Doesn't vent direct to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and supersonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppressed firehttps://youtu.be/GvUjVYg8JBk">ADAMS AR-15 PISTON CONVERSION KITS <span class="count">(9)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-765"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/security-products/personal-safety/">Personal Safety <span class="count">(21)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-838"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/security-products/stealth-cameras/">Stealth Cameras <span class="count">(5)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-912"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/security-products/weapons-scopes/">WEAPONS SCOPES <span class="count">(5)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-995"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/security-products/firearms/" title="NOTE: Firearms cannot be ordered online.

The  tradition of using the kettle as a method of boiling water at  lunchtime, goes back to the 1890's in the West Coast of Ireland and the  design has changed little since it was first introduced.
Lough  Conn is famous for its free rising brown trout and fresh run Salmon from  the River Moy system. The lake provided (and still provides) ample fuel  for use in the kettle, where washed up twigs, sticks and dried grass  were easily available. On wet &amp; stormy days, the local angling  guides would keep watch for the small pillar of smoke on the lake shore  which indicated that a colleague already had a 'brew' on! A hot cup of  tea or soup awaited anyone who landed and the Kettle would be repeatedly  boiled as additional boats laden with anglers arrived. Tradition  dictates that both the angling guide (Ghillie) and his guests (usually 2  anglers to his boat) together would gather dry tinder for the kettle  from the lake shore. Then, the Ghillie will set about boiling up the  kettle which always amazed guests as it works even in the height of a  storm! The Anglers will then be offered their fresh tea from the Kelly  Kettle and in return for his hospitality, the Ghillie received lunch and  perhaps a drop of whiskey from the anglers.
The Kelly family  still provide a Boat Hire &amp; Ghillie service on Lough Conn. Visiting  anglers are as intrigued today as they were some hundred years ago with  the speed at which the water can be boiled and through word of mouth,  these anglers have spread word about the kettles worldwide. To this day,  the Kelly-Kettle / Volcano-Kettle is still the centerpiece in any  campsite. If you have seen one in action, you will understand why!Increasingly gaining in popularity, our company now sells our Kettles all over the world from the USA, Canada, UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Germany and as far away as Zambia &amp; Australia.  Once exclusively used by anglers, Kelly kettles are now been used by  all types of outdoor enthusiasts such as explorers, Kayakers, hill  walkers, Car Campers, Scouts, Gardeners or as a vital item in wilderness  survival kits.
Proud of our history, we are  always on the look out for interesting stories from the past and present  regarding our Kettles and look forward to receiving them from you, our  valued customers.">Kelly Kettles Rocket Stoves <span class="count">(11)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-773"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/lanterns/">LANTERNS <span class="count">(18)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-609"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/navigation-tools/">Navigation Tools <span class="count">(26)</span></a> <em id="parent"></em><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-2291"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/navigation-tools/compasses/">COMPASSES <span class="count">(6)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-763"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/navigation-tools/gps-units/">GPS UNITS <span class="count">(9)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-799"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/navigation-tools/multi-function-watches-compass/">Multi Function Watches/Compass <span class="count">(3)</span></a></li></ul></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-612"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/on-the-road/">On The Road <span class="count">(30)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-613"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/on-the-water/">On The Water <span class="count">(32)</span></a> <em id="parent"></em><ul class="children"><li class="cat-item cat-item-679"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/on-the-water/bilge-pumps-also-listed-under-pumping-water-category/">Bilge Pumps (also listed under "PUMPING WATER" Category) <span class="count">(0)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-681"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/on-the-water/inflatable-craft/" title="What would you do if you had to cross a wide river getting home?">Inflatable Craft <span class="count">(0)</span></a></li></ul></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-894"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/outdoor-camp-cooking/">OUTDOOR CAMP COOKING <span class="count">(9)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-871"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/outdoor-equipment/pest-and-mosquito-repellants/" title="&nbsp;Nearly everyone has been there – the perfect picnic on a summer's day that suddenly became invaded by mosquitoes. These obnoxious little pests bite, leaving itchy, painful welts behind that can last for days. But what do you do? No one wants to forgo the pleasures of summer – fishing, the pool, barbecues, and more. But did you know that mosquitoes pose more serious health risks than an itchy bite mark?The DiseasesAbout 10 percent of the 2000 species of mosquitoes live in North America. Thriving in humid and damp areas, mosquitoes reproduce quickly. Laying eggs in shallow pools of water, the eggs hatch and grow, becoming adult, biting mosquitoes. And these biting pests can carry a myriad of diseases:West Nile Virus – now considered a seasonal epidemic in North America, West Nile virus makes the news nearly every summer. It causes inflammation of the brain, and can be fatal in some patients.
Malaria – this mosquito-borne disease can be found around the world, primarily in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the South Pacific. Symptoms can vary from one patient to another, and include fever, body aches, coma, and death.
Dengue fever – this disease can be found in the tropics, and comes from a certain type of mosquito that is active during the day time.
Yellow fever – found in South America and Africa, this disease does have a vaccine. However, in areas where the vaccine is unavailable, the mosquitoes transmit the disease from one person to another.
Heartworm – a parasite affecting household pets, the larvae are transmitted by mosquitoes. Untreated, heartworms can clog up the heart, causing cardiovascular problems and death.

Our freeze dried fruit  products provide this vital nutrition and are designed to have a shelf  life of 30 years. Our dehydrated fruit will stay on your shelf for 25  years, giving you years of nutritious security.
Fruit is vitamin rich and our freeze-drying process retains these  important vitamins. Strawberries contain more vitamin C than any other  fruit; just one cup of strawberries provides 30% of your recommended  daily dose. Strawberries are also high in antioxidants that will protect  against volatile free radicals. Apples are rich in antioxidants as  well, in particular flavonoids that give youthful vitality and  appearance. Apples are known to have anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic  and anti-carcinogenic properties.
We are proud to provide a complete selection of freeze dried fruit  and special attention must be drawn to our blueberries. Blueberries are  the highest-ranking fruit in terms of antioxidants. Just one cup of  blueberries provides 11% of your daily allowance of fiber and 4% of your  vitamin C. This fruit also has many health benefits.

New Chapter supplements are whole food. Easily recognized and absorbed.
New  Chapter vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements are a whole-food  complex – something your body easily recognizes and absorbs. Sourced  from nature’s bounty of organic fruits, vegetables, herbs and superfoods  and cultured in probiotics to deliver the full spectrum of Nature’s  benefits.
This is a very big deal.
Because the whole truth  about most of the conventional vitamins, minerals and supplements on the  shelves is that they are synthetic chemical isolates. Our bodies  understand and seek nourishment from whole food. Synthetic chemical  isolated forms of nutrients lack the full spectrum of Nature’s benefits  and, frankly, we prefer the real thing to a synthetic version of the  real thing. Who wouldn’t?
Gentle on your stomach because they’re food
Because  New Chapter’s vitamins, minerals and herbs are a whole-food complex,  they’re gentle on your stomach. So gentle that you can even take them on  an empty stomach. In fact, we don’t even consider them food  supplements, They’re supplemental food.
Organic Products, Organic Mission; Committed to organic ingredients.
Many  of our vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements are certified organic  and most New Chapter products are made with organic ingredients. From  the fruits, vegetables, herbs and superfoods we source around the world  to our very own biodynamic farm in Costa Rica, we are committed to organic ingredients.
We believe organic makes a difference
New  Chapter was the first company in the world to produce a full line of  whole food complexed vitamins and supplements certified to be made with  organic ingredients. We believe the natural purity of organic  ingredients is better for people and better for the environment.
Organic  crops are, on average, more nutrient dense than conventionally grown  crops -- sometimes more than 20 percent for certain minerals and, on  average, about 30 percent for antioxidants.
We live the organic lifestyle
We’ve  been living an organic lifestyle and working toward an organic,  sustainable world since New Chapter began in 1982. It has long been the  heart and soul of our people, especially Vice Chairman Tom Newmark, the man who leads our organic mission.
Discover Luna Nueva – Our very own organic farm
We  don’t just source organic ingredients. We also grow them, including  organic turmeric and ginger at Luna Nueva, our own biodynamic farm  nestled in the rainforests of Costa Rica. Luna Nueva is at the core of  who we are. See for yourself -- check out our Luna Nueva video.

This edition explores a variety of fascinating topics such as slow food  cooking in Costa Rica, the importance of bees, and the experiences of  one of our interns at the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

“Katadyn Survivor Watermakers must be tested and inspected annually or after each deployment, according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures.&nbsp; Katadyn Survivor Watermakers must be flushed with biocide annually per the storage instructions.&nbsp; The recommended factory service schedule for Katadyn Survivor manual watermakers is 2 year intervals for aviation and 3 year intervals for marine/nautical use.&nbsp; Watermakers stored and used on aircraft require more frequent service than those stored on boats.&nbsp; Longer intervals between service may result in more expensive service since some units may not meet specifications for water output or salinity reduction.
&nbsp;
IMPORTANT: For your safety, we require that the above procedure be completed once a year (storage temperature < 25°C/77°F). Please be aware to use only biocides supplied by Katadyn for your product. Other products like chlorine-based products will damage your reverse osmosis membrane.”
&nbsp;
For your information- We service many units here in our Katadyn Marine Tech Service department.&nbsp; Many units returned for service are over 3 – 8 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most have never been serviced.&nbsp; Most still meet specifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for those that do not meet spec, most are within 10 – 15% of the claimed product specifications.&nbsp; That said, regular service is REQUIRED to ensure Katadyn desalinators meet salinity reduction and performance claims.">DESALINATORS SALT WATER FILTER <span class="count">(7)</span></a></li><li class="cat-item cat-item-844"><a href="https://www.readymaderesources.com/product-category/water-filters-storage/life-saver-water-filters-removes-viruses/" title="Lifesaver Water Filter• LIFESAVER® removes a minimum &nbsp;&nbsp;99.99% of viruses, 99.9999% of bacteria &nbsp;&nbsp;and 99.9% of cysts
