<dd class="txt">
This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "Device") and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner, the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, "Affiliates") or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered through the Site.

<dt class="tit">2. U.S. Governing Law; Safe Harbor.</dt>
<dd class="txt">The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by  and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no  representation that this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or  regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By participating in our  Site activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility  requirements for this Site as set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement.  If you do not meet such age and other eligibility requirements, please  discontinue using the Site immediately as your continued use of the Site  indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure,  management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy  Policy.</dd>
<dd class="txt">If you are located outside of the U.S., the European Economic Area and  Switzerland, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and you,  not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and  national laws. If this Site is part of the Flux platform, by using this  Site, participating in any Site activities, and/or providing us with  your Personal Information and Other Information, you </dd>
<dd class="ss_txt">(i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information you provide to the Site and to Flux, </dd>

<dd class="ss_txt">(iii) understand that this Site and Flux will collect, transfer, store,  process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this  Privacy Policy and the Flux Privacy Policy and U.S. law. Consequently,  to the full extent permitted by law, you hereby waive any claims  relating to the processing of your Personal Information or Other  Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy that may arise under  the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or  jurisdiction.</dd>
<dt class="tit">3. Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information  (Other than Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional  Opportunities).</dt>
<dd class="txt">When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information that  would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full  name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number.

<dt class="s_tit">a. Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</dt>
<dd class="ss_txt">i. User Registration. To the extent we offer user registration on the  Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a  user name and password (together, your "User ID") and may be required to  also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of  birth. Additional Information may be requested during the registration  process (but not required).</dd>

To sign up for or  participate in these features or functions, you may be required to  provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to  personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For  example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to  provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from  any user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such  services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the  Terms of Use Agreement), in addition to your name and contact  information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address,  shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment  instrument information, your order number and information about your  computer's internet address and website which may have referred or  directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL). Your credit card or  debit card number is collected via a secure transmission.</dd>
<dd class="ss_txt">iii. In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.

You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive  special Promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors  or promotional partners ("Advertisers") as a result of your use of the  Site in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</dd>
<dt class="s_tit">b. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</dt>
<dd class="ss_txt">"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies", "web beacons" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</dd>
<dd class="ss_txt">We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", "Other Information Collected by Us" section below. These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site, such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("Identifier"). An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site. Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.</dd>
<dd class="ss_txt">By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.
This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("Targeting Services"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</dd>
<dd class="ss_txt">These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.</dd>

    <br><br>
    Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising tailored to your interests.

The opt-out tools discussed above are "cookie based."

    <dd class="s_txt">Realtytoday may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Realtytoday, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Realtytoday. The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.<br>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.<br>
Users that register for Realtytoday's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Realtytoday. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, Realtytoday, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</dd>

<dd class="s_tit">a. Registration. </dd>
<dd class="s_txt">To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Realtytoday's wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Realtytoday depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</dd>
    <dd class="ss_txt"><em>i. Single Opt-in Method:</em> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Realtytoday will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Realtytoday to send text messages to him or her. Realtytoday will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Realtytoday or by sending a text message to Realtytoday that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</dd>
    <dd class="ss_txt"><em>ii. Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</em>In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Realtytoday's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Realtytoday) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Realtytoday will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Realtytoday to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Realtytoday's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Realtytoday may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Realtytoday continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</dd>
    <dd class="ss_txt"><em>iii. Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</em>In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Realtytoday will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Realtytoday to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Realtytoday's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Realtytoday may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Realtytoday continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</dd>
    <dd class="s_tit">b. Termination of Wireless Services by User.  </dd>
<dd class="s_txt">A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Realtytoday at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". Realtytoday will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Realtytoday. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Realtytoday service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</dd>
<dd class="s_tit">c. Termination of Wireless Services by Realtytoday.   </dd>
<dd class="s_txt">A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Realtytoday may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.

<dd class="s_tit">d. Use of Information.</dd>

<dd class="s_txt">Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site by clicking "Account" on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID to change, update or deactivate your Personal Information. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.<br>
You may also exercise certain privacy settings options by, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, clicking "Profile" or your display name at the top of the Site, selecting "Edit Profile" or "Manage Account" and selecting the "Privacy" tab.<br>
Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<br>
If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.<br>
Children or Ineligible Teenagers.. If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "Parent") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).<br>
In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; <br>alternatively, Parents may send an email to the Site's Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Realtytoday will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. Realtytoday will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. </dd>
