<p>Effective Date: December 9, 2009</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting the HBO.com site (the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at the Site. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site, and covers information collected on or through or in connection with your use of the Site.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy or to change, modify or otherwise alter any feature of the Site in our sole discretion at any time. Changes may be communicated to you via one of the following methods: (1) by sending an e-mail alerting you to the revised Privacy Policy; or (2) by otherwise making the revised Privacy Policy available for your review. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will supersede the prior provisions for all activity occurring after the revised version has been made available in the manner described above. Your continued use of the Site after the revised version is made available constitutes your agreement to the revision.</p>

<h4>The Information We Collect </h4>

<p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Site or access the Site, such as: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Mozilla Firefox, Netscape, Internet Explorer); the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Mac or PC); the IP address of any of your Computer(s) which may be used to access the Site; certain information necessary for us to uniquely identify your Computer(s); the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., RoadRunner); referring/exit pages; date/time stamp; clickstream data; and pixel tags.

In such event, you recognize that such successor, person or entity may make changes or modifications to this Privacy Policy, and your continued use of the Site constitutes consent to any such changes or modifications.</p>

By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the Site activity. We have no control over these parties' use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these parties will obtain such information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>To enhance your experience with the Site, many of our web pages on the Site use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.

However, once you choose to furnish the Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>

We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>We take information security seriously and use reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
