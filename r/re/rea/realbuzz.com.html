	<p>
		As the protection of your privacy is of the greatest importance to us, we have created this Privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of ‘personal information’ that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, gender, phone number, email address, or any other information provided to us by users who have registered with us (Members) and email subscribers. You do not have to share personal information to use the Website. The Website does not collect personal information about people without their permission.
	</p>
	<p><strong>How we collate and use personal information</strong></p>
	<p>
		The Website gathers personal information by means of the following methods: signing up to the Website; through events and exhibitions; and through the provision of information to the realbuzz.com shop. Newsletters are sent out only to those subscribers who have given their consent. In order to provide you with improved, relevant content, we compile information about email response and website usage. This information helps us to better understand our Members' and email subscribers’ site usage patterns and also what types of content and information may help improve your user experience on the Website. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To improve our online services the Website periodically performs statistical analyses of aggregate user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas of the website and to use such information to improve on the ability to serve you better. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The personal information we gather from subscribers to our email newsletters (including email addresses) is not shared with other organisations or third parties without permission. The Website is extremely protective of the information gathered through its online membership and email subscriptions. From time to time we may send out emails on behalf of like-minded organisations to those subscribers who have given their consent, but we do not provide them with access to any other personal information. We will not sell your name or email address to any third party advertisers without your permission. From time to time we may wish to share your data with other carefully selected organizations for the purposes of contacting you about products and services that we think we may be of interest to you

You will be asked if you want to cancel this reminder for future occasions.

	</p>
	<p><strong>Collection of personal information by third-party sites and sponsors</strong></p>
	<p>
		Where we provide links to third party websites (whether or not they are affiliated with the Website and even if the Website branding appears on these sites), such websites are not controlled by us and are not covered by this Privacy policy. These links are provided for your convenience only. If you access these sites by using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy.

	</p>
	<p><strong>The use of cookies</strong></p>
	<p>
		To enhance your experience of the Website, all of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalise your experience of the Website (e.g. to recognise you by name when you return to the Website), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts. We also may use cookies to offer you products of potential interest in emails. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. However, this will inhibit the functionality of the Website on your browser.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p><strong>Email and email newsletter communications</strong></p>
	<p>
		We will not contact you via email for any purpose except in connection with sending you the newsletters and/or emails you have requested, if you are in breach of the Website’s Terms of use, maintaining our subscription and unsubscription lists, communicating with you in the event of a change in the ownership of the Website or its business, or notifying you of our special offers or changes to the Website, business practices, Terms of use or Privacy policy, unless (i) we are required to do so by applicable law or pursuant to a court or similar order; (ii) as deemed necessary, in the Website’s discretion, to protect the legal rights or the property of the website, a member or third party, or to prevent personal injury; or (iii) you have provided your consent for us to do so.

	<p><strong>How we track HTML newsletters</strong></p>
	<p>
		The Website makes use of both "open-tracking" and "click-tracking" in our HTML newsletters (i.e. emails that contain text and images). Open-tracking allows us to find out how many people have viewed our email newsletters and click-tracking allows us to find out which links in the newsletter were clicked on. This helps us to refine and improve the editorial content of the Website’s newsletters, and to provide you with relevant information.

	<p>
		All Website communication, whether via email newsletter subscription, and subscriptions to blog and/or forum posts, provides information on how to unsubscribe quickly and easily.

	<p><strong>Third-party advertisers</strong></p>
	<p>
		The Website allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Website.

They may also use other technologies (such as cookies) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalise the advertising content you see.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Website does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific programme or feature for which you will have the ability to opt in or opt out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks the Website to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men aged 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men aged 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
	</p>
