                                  <h4 class="servicetext1 style3">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY Reachoo </h4>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">reachoo collects User submitted personal information such as name, mailing   address, email address, telephone number and age to authenticate Users, and to   send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the reachoo   service, special events, contests and special offers. </p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">As is standard practice on many corporate websites, reachoo also logs   non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile   information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Users and other   visitors to the site. This data is used to improve the website services, to   analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the   site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. reachoo   will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This   non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to   provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User IP addresses   are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">In addition reachoo uses pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what   parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of   searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email   messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have   been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to   our customers. reachoo stores all of this information in a secure database.</p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">User Profile information including Users' pictures and first names is   displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the reachoo social   networking community. Users' full names are never directly revealed to other   Users.</p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">Reachoo may also use a Users’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or   news regarding the service. Reachoo may send email messages which use a   “click-through URL” linked to content on the reachoo website. When a customer   clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at   the destination web page. Reachoo tracks this click-through data to help determine   interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer   communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or   graphic links in the email.</p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">From time to time, reachoo or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or   contest on reachoo. Users may be asked to provide personal information including   name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to   participate. Reachoo may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that   you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at   the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose   privacy statement will apply. </p>
                                  <p class="servicetext1">Reachoo may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a   better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.   Reachoo also collects information regarding customer activities on our website, and   on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful   information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and   Internet services are of most interest to them.</p>                                  <p class="servicetext1">&nbsp;</p></td>
