<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate
our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy
describes how ReadyHosting.com collects information from all end
users of ReadyHosting.com's Internet and web hosting services
(the "Services")-those who access some of our Services
but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those
who pay a service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what
we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors
and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information.
ReadyHosting.com requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Information ReadyHosting.com
Collects and How It Is Used</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduction.</font></b>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
ReadyHosting.com collects information in different ways from Visitors
and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the
network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this
information primarily to provide a customized experience as you
use our Services and, generally, do not share this information
with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information
collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in
very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such
disclosure is required by law or other special cases described
below. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1">
Members are asked to provide certain personal information when
they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone
number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and
the type of personal computer being used to access the Services.
The personal information collected from Members during the registration
process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing
purposes). This information is not shared with third parties,
unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
However, in instances where ReadyHosting.com and a partner jointly
promote the Services, ReadyHosting.com may provide the partner
certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username
of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint
promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner
to assess the results of the promotion.  In this instance, personal
information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose.
ReadyHosting.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate
profiles from personal information Members provide during registration
(such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As
explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and
non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear
on the Services. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">ReadyHosting.com Partners and Sponsors.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Some ReadyHosting.com products and services are
offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated
partner.  To provide Visitors and Members some of these products
and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal
information. ReadyHosting.com will share nonidentifying and aggregate
information (except as described above), but not personal information,
with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products
or services offered. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="-1">Online Advertisements.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> From time to time, ReadyHosting.com may display
online advertisements. We share aggregated and non-identifying
information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions
with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use
this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience
they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years
of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience.
Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have
collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended
audience. ReadyHosting.com does not share personal information
about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Responses to Email Inquiries.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1">  When Visitors or Members send email inquiries
to ReadyHosting.com, the return email address is used to answer
the email inquiry we receive. ReadyHosting.com does not use the
return email address for any other purpose and does not share
the return email address with any third party. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Voluntary Customer Surveys.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1">  We may periodically conduct both business and
individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate
in these surveys because they provide us with important information
that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how
we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses
will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted
by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We take the information we receive from
individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or
aggregate) it with the responses of other ReadyHosting.com customers
to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such
as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry
sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated
information to improve the quality of our services to you, and
to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally
identifying information may be shared with third parties.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Special Cases.</font></b>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
 It is ReadyHosting.com's policy not to use or share the personal
information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the
ones described above without also providing you an opportunity
to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However,
ReadyHosting.com may disclose personal information about Visitors
or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services
or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if,
in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do
so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for
such information; to disclose information that is necessary to
identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may
be violating our Terms of Service or other user policies; to operate
the Services properly; or to protect ReadyHosting.com and our
Members. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">"Cookies" and How ReadyHosting.com
Uses Them.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1">  A "cookie"
is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when
you visit certain Web sites. ReadyHosting.com may use cookies
to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical
purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to
manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we
will use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable
and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties
to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be aware
that if you visit non-ReadyHosting.com Web sites where you are
prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required
to accept cookies. <br>
Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do
not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility
for information collected through them. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">ReadyHosting.com recommends that children
ask a parent for permission before sending personal information
to ReadyHosting.com, or to anyone else online.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Public Forums.</font></b>
<font face="Arial" size="-1">
Please remember that any information you may disclose in public
areas of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public information.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal
information in these public areas. </font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">ReadyHosting.com's Commitment to Data
Security.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1">  Services and Web sites
we sponsor or host have security measures in place to protect
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our
control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and
security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that
our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers"
from illegally obtaining this information. </font></p>
