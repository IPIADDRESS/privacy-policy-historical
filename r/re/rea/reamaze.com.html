	<h1>Reamaze Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>We understand that the security, privacy, and safety of your business data is one of the most important concerns. We've put together this privacy policy to communicate how serious we are about privacy and how we treat the information collected and received by your use of our website, <a href="http://www.reamaze.com">http://www.reamaze.com</a> ("Website", "us", "we", "our") and the customer lifecycle management services we provide. By visiting Reamaze’s website, or using any of our services or products, you acknowledge that you accept the policies and practices outlined here.</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to how we treat gathered personal information of you when you are accessing our website and services as well as the data (“user data”) gathered about your end users relevant to the services we provide. Some of Reamaze’s features and services require personal information to be gathered.</p>

	<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

	<p>The Personal Information we collect from our users comes in three forms:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors to the website. We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information*, time logs, the pages you request, and other relevant statistics whenever you access our website. This Non Personally Identifiable Information will only be used to analyze how our website is being used.</li>

		<li>Second, we also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you create a Reamaze account and when you utilize our product and services (Personal Information you provide us). During account creation, we will collect your full name, email address, phone number, and company information. When billing is applicable, you may need to provide your credit card information as well. Certain Personally Identifiable Information such as your email address will be required if you allow us to communicate with you.</li>

		<li>Thirdly, in order to provide certain customer lifecycle management features, we also receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us about your customers’ Personal Information (“End User Customers”). The quantity and types of End User Customer information we receive may be determined solely by you the user.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cookie Information</h3>

	<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Reamaze’s core features.</p>

	<h2>What Do We Do With The Collected Information?</h2>

	<p>The primary goals for collecting information (your Personally Identifiable and Non Identifiable Information as well as End User Customer information) is to provide you with an effective, valuable, and customized experience while using our website and product. Reamaze will never give, rent, or sell your information (and your End User Customer Information)  to any third party not affiliated with or owned by Reamaze, except as permitted by law. Reamaze will only send Personally Identifiable Information about you and your customers to other companies or people if:

	</p><ul>
		<li>We have your permission to share the information;</li>
		<li>We need to share your information to provide the products or services you have requested;</li>
		<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Reamaze to provide a product or service to you.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We respond to subpoenas, court order, or legal process of find that your actions on our website violate the Reamaze Terms of Use or any of our guidelines for specific products or services.
	However, we reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Reamaze, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

	<h3>Regarding your End User Customer Information</h3>

	<p>Your End User Customer Information will never be revealed or cross-referenced or cross-correlated with other user accounts. These precautionary and preventative measures are in place to secure your End User Customer Information from competitor activities and other relevant business transactions.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>

	<p>We do our best to protect all user information as well as the privacy of your account. In addition to setting a strong password and taking the necessary steps to prevent unauthorized account access, you should be always aware of the types of information being passed to us. We cannot guarantee absolute security as the Internet is never entirely secure. Unauthorized entries, network vulnerabilities, hardware/software failure and other external factors may compromise your Personal Information and your End User Customer Information at any given time. We use encryption to protect all sensitive information online and the servers that house your Personally Identifiable Information are housed in a secure and vetted environment.</p>

	<h2>Access</h2>

	<p>You may alter, add, or delete your Personally Identifiable Information at any given time by accessing your account settings. This includes but not limited to your full name, email address, company name, billing information, profile photo, etc. You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reamaze.com">support@reamaze.com</a> to correct, update, or delete and deactivate our record of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

	<p>You always have the freedom to choose what information is disclosed to us. Keep in mind however that certain features of our product and service will require your End User Customer Information. You may add, update, and or delete information you have disclosed to us by contacting us. Please note that we may retain some information for internal use but never in a way that will be Personally Identifiable.</p>

	<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>

	<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any given time. Change in ways we collect and user Personal Information will be announced on our website or within your user account.</p>
