<p><b>Anonymous information collected on this website</b></p>
<p>We record anonymous data such as traffic logs, number of visits or clicks on a given page, pages viewed or links to our site. We use IP addresses and cookies for gathering website statistics. We also store IP addresses on our server in the event that our site becomes corrupted and it becomes necessary to discover the cause of this corruption. We aggregate this anonymous data as part of managing, maintaining and reporting on use of our website.</p>
<p>We may share this anonymous data with third parties for the limited purpose of reporting on use of our website, or to comply with the applicable law. We do not rent, sell or share any anonymous data collected on this website with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

<p><b>Cookies and web beacons</b></p>
<p>We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.</p>
<p>We might use third party advertisements on&nbsp;realtyclub.info to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for different ad targeting purposes.</p>
<p>You may opt-out of those cookies at the appropriate vendor or ad network websites if they provide that capability, or try to opt-out of some, but not all of these cookies in one location, at the Network Advertising Initiative <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p><b>DoubleClick DART cookies</b></p>
<p>We may also use DART cookies for ad serving. The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on our website. When you visit our website and either view or click an ad, a cookie may be dropped on your browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on our website and across the web. Use of the DART cookie enables Google and its partners to serve ads to you on your visit of our or other pages on the Internet.

<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in your other programs. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
<p><b>Links</b></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.</p>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our privacy policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
<p><b>Controlling your privacy</b></p>
<p>Note that you can change your browser settings to disable cookies if you have privacy concerns. Disabling cookies for all sites is not recommended as it may interfere with your use of some sites. The best option is to disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.</p>
