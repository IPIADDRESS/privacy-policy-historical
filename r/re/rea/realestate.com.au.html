<p>provided that if we do use your personal information in these ways, we will always give you the opportunity to request that your information not be used for further direct marketing in the future.</p>

    We may disclose your personal information to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Estate agents or agencies, property developers, builders, retirement community operators that have listings or advertising on our Websites and which you
    have requested information from by submitting an enquiry. If you request information from these organisations through our Website, you will need to check

    use, disclose or handle personal information.</li>

  </li><li> Relevant public authorities, our legal representatives or other concerned parties, in special situations where, either:
      <ul>
            <li>we have reason to believe that disclosing your personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging,
           injuring, or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities;
           or</li>
          <li>we believe, in good faith, that the law requires disclosure.</li>
      </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Storage, Security and Processing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information submitted to our Websites, and we review and update our security measures
    in light of current technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. However, we will endeavour to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may transmit to us from our online products and services or

<p>
    Personal information submitted by REA’s customers and visitors to our Websites may be held on servers located in Australia or in the data centres of REA’s

    of data intra-group, has verified the security arrangements of its outsourced data processors and has implemented contractual arrangements intra-group and
    with its outsourced data processors in accordance with <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth). When you provide us with your personal information you give us your consent to
    the transfer of personal information outside of Australia for the purposes described above.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction and access</strong>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookies and Web Beacons </strong>
</p>
<p>
    By using our Websites, you consent to the use of Cookies, Web Beacons and measurement software in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    ‘Cookies’ are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back
    to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that website.
</p>

<p>Cookies are industry standard and are used by most websites, including our Websites and are useful because they allow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a website to recognise a user’s device to enable more efficient navigation of the website, remember preferences and generally improve a user’s
    experience;</li>
  <li>customisation and personalisation of advertising presented to you based on your interests which are determined by your actions such as the pages you
    view, the links you click, the search terms you enter using search engines, the products and services you use on our Websites including registrations with
    Myrealestate and MyCommercial; and</li>
  <li>compilation of analytical data to improve site performance and monitor traffic, measure the effectiveness of products, services, website usage and
    auditing.</li>
</ul>


<p>‘Web Beacons’ are small pieces of code that are contained in emails and webpages and allow a website to transfer or collect information such as whether an
    email is opened or links are clicked upon. We may use Web Beacons to determine which emails and web pages are interesting to you and for the same reasons
    we use Cookies on our Websites.</p>
<p>
    When you use our products, services or visit our Websites, we may, or we may allow service providers or third parties such as our analytics partners
    including Nielsen, Adobe and Hockey App, or our advertising and adserving partners, to place one or more ‘Cookies’ on your computer or
    collect information about your browsing activities through Web Beacons. If your access to our products, services or Websites is through a mobile or tablet
    device, we may, or we may allow these service providers or third parties to use mobile or tablet measurement software to obtain similar information that we
    do through Cookies and Web Beacons. We allow these third parties to use Cookies, use Web Beacons and measurement software on our Websites to assist us to
    provide or improve the provision of our products and services to you, display personalised advertising and to assist us to audit, measure and analyse usage
    across our Websites. We may combine our Cookies (or information collected through our Cookies and Web Beacons) with third party Cookies to provide more
    relevant services and advertising to you on our Websites or third party websites.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookie Choices</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies or mobile measurement software, there is a simple procedure in most browsers or the
    settings section of mobile and table devices that allows you to deny or accept the cookie or mobile measurement software feature. However, you should note
    that disabling these features may cause some of the functions on our Websites not to work properly.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Applications, widgets or links to other websites</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We provide links to web sites outside of our Websites, as well as to third party websites. We also allow some third parties to display widgets and
    applications on our Websites that allow you to interact and share content including social media buttons such as Facebook share and like, Twitter,
    Pinterest and Google+. These linked sites, applications and widgets are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of
    companies linked to our Websites or collecting information through these third party applications or widgets. Before disclosing your personal information
    on any other website, or using these applications or widgets we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that website and the relevant third
    party’s data collection practices and controls in their privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Credit applications by real estate agents</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you apply to us for credit, we will ask you to authorise us to obtain personal information about you from credit reporting agencies, other credit
    providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services, your bank and certain other businesses for the purposes of assessing your application.
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    We will also require you to authorise us to disclose your personal information to:</p>

<ul>
<li> credit reporting agencies (for the purpose of obtaining a credit report); and</li>
<li>  other credit providers, existing or previous suppliers of goods or services, your bank and certain other businesses (for the purposes of assessing your
    application).</li></ul>
<p>In addition to the ways in which we may use personal information set out above, if you are a customer of one of our Websites, we may also use your
    personal information:</p>
<ul><li> to help carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;</li>
