            <h2>Privacy Policy "Bill of Rights"</h2>
            <p>At Realtyshares we take your privacy and your private information very seriously and thus we have created a few basic privacy principles or as we like to call it a "bill of rights" that we try and adhere to.  This Bill of Rights includes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we need it.</li>
            <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our Website or one of our services.</li>
            <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
            <li>We will send you emails relating to your personal transactions but will keep these emails to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Capital Seekers/Investment Managers may receive the email addresses and other personal information of their investors if, and only if, their real estate project or investment is successfully funded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By using realtyshares.com and any related sites or services (collectively, the "Website") you accept the practices and terms set forth in our Privacy Policy below (which seeks to incorporate and implement the Bill of Rights), as they may be updated from time to time in RealtyShares sole and absolute discretion.</p>
            <h2>Information Collection</h2>
