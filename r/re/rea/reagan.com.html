				<h1><strong>Privacy</strong> Policy</h1>
				Collection of Your Personal Information
                <p> At   Reagan.com, @Reagan.com, Reagan Search, and other Reagan sites,   collectively the Reagan Network we ask you to provide personal   information, such as name, your e-mail address, home or work address, or   telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as   your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you   choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service,   we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number   and billing address, which is used to create a Reagan Network account. </p>
                <p> In order to access some Reagan   Network services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address or   user name and password. As part of creating your credentials, you may   also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use   to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as   well as an alternate e-mail address. Some services may require added   security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional   security key. </p>
                <p> We may collect information about   your interaction with Reagan Network sites and services. For example, we   may use site analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from   your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and   the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our   site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. We may   also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described   below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you   click and other actions you take on our sites and services.   Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser   sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type   and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. When you   receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Reagan Network, we may   use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar   technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which   links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail   communications or other information. </p>
                <p> In order to offer you a more   consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Reagan   Network, information collected through one Reagan Network service may be   combined with information obtained through other Reagan Network   services. We may also supplement the information we collect with   information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use   services from other companies that enable us to derive a general   geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain   services to your geographic area. </p>
                <p>Use of Your Personal Information </p>
                <p> Reagan Network collects and uses   your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services.   These uses may include providing you with more effective customer   service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the   need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing   research and analysis aimed at improving our products, and services and   technologies. </p>
                <p> We also use your personal   information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory   service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders,   information on technical service issues, and security announcements.   Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about   other Reagan Network products and services, and/or share your personal   information with Reagan Network partners so they may send you   information about their products and services. </p>
                <p> Personal information collected on   Reagan Network sites and services may be stored and processed in the   United States or any other country in which Reagan Network or its   affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.   Reagan Network abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the   U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention   of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and   Switzerland. </p>
                <p>Sharing of Your Personal Information </p>
                <p> Except as described in this   statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of   Reagan Network and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without   your consent. </p>
                <p> Some Reagan Network services may   be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you   register for or use such services, both Reagan Network and the other   company may receive information collected in conjunction with the   co-branded services. </p>
                <p> We occasionally hire other   companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling   the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support,   hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical   analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to   obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service.   They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and   are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. However, for credit   card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to   help improve their service. This helps them more accurately detect   fraudulent uses of credit cards. We may access or disclose information   about you, including the content of your communications, in order to:   (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process;   (b) protect the rights or property of Reagan Network or our customers,   including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your   use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access   or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Reagan   Network employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose   personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger   or sale of assets. </p>
                <p>Accessing Your Personal Information </p>
                <p> You may have the ability to view   or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your   personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required   to sign in with your e-mail address or user name and password. The   appropriate method(s) for accessing your personal information will   depend on which sites or services you have used. </p>
                <p>Communication Preferences </p>
                <p> You can stop the delivery of   future promotional e-mail from Reagan Network sites and services by   following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. </p>
                <p> You may also have the option of   proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional e-mail,   telephone calls, and postal mail from particular Reagan Network sites or   services.: </p>
                <p>Security of Your Personal Information </p>
                <p> Reagan Network is committed to   protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety   of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal   information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example,   we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with   limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we   transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number   or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of   encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. </p>
                <p> If a password is used to help   protect your accounts and personal information, it is your   responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this   information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you   should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access   to your information from subsequent users. </p>
                <p>Use of Cookies </p>
                <p> Reagan Network Web sites use   "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help   personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that   is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain   information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that   issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or   deliver viruses to your computer. </p>
                <p> One of the primary purposes of   cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your   computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly   enter the same information and to display your personalized content and   appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites. Reagan   Network Web sites also use cookies as described in the Collection of   your information and </p>
                <p> You have the ability to accept or   decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you   can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you   prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in   or use other interactive features of Reagan Network sites and services   that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are   dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected. </p>
                <p> If you choose to accept cookies,   you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have   accepted. In Internet Explorer 7, you can delete cookies by selecting   âToolsâ, âDelete browsing historyâ and clicking the âDelete Cookiesâ   button. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences   controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be   deleted and may need to be recreated. </p>
                <p>Use of Web Beacons </p>
                <p> Reagan Network Web pages may   contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called   single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on   our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and   to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in   promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine   whether messages have been opened and acted upon. </p>
                <p> Reagan Network may also employ Web   beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated   statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or   other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from   being used by third parties to collect or access your personal   information. </p>
                <p> Finally, we may work with other   companies that advertise on Reagan Network sites to place Web beacons on   their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often   clicking on an advertisement on a Reagan Network site results in a   purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. </p>
                <p>Controlling Unsolicited E-mail ("Spam") </p>
                <p> Reagan Network is concerned about   controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." Reagan Network has   a strict Anti Spam Policy prohibiting the use of a Reagan   Network-provided e-mail account to send spam. Reagan Network will not   sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While   Reagan Network continues to actively review and implement new   technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently   available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving   of unsolicited e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about   the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the   amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. </p>
                <p>Changes to This Privacy Statement </p>
                <p> We will occasionally update this   privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer   feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the   "last updated" date at the bottom of this statement. If there are   material changes to this statement or in how Reagan Network will use   your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently   posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by   directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically   review this statement to be informed of how Reagan Network is protecting   your information. </p>
                <p> Contacting Us </p>
                <p> Reagan Network welcomes your   comments regarding this privacy statement. If you have questions about   this statement, please contact us at editor@Reagan Network. </p>
