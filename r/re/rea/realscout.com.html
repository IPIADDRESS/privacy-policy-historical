        <p>
          RealScout is based in the United States and our servers and data centers are primarily located in the United
          States. If you choose to use the Services from outside the U.S., then you should know that you are
          transferring your Personal Information outside of your region and into the U.S. for storage and processing. By
          providing your information to us through your use of the Services, you consent to the transfer, storage, and
          processing of such information in the U.S. and other countries. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S.
          to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and
          operating the Services. You should know that each region can have its own privacy and data security laws, some
          of which may be less stringent as compared to those of your own region.
        </p>
        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable security measures that are designed to protect personal information from accidental loss,
          disclosure, misuse, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that no data security measures can be
          guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
          information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk.
        </p>
        <h2>UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
        <p>
          We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the
          beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of our Services after such changes will be subject to the
          then-current policy. If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or
          disclosure of your information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change (such as adding a
          statement to our homepage, sending you an email or such other method as we determine) and to obtain your
          consent prior to applying the change to any information that we collected from you prior to the date the
          change becomes effective. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we
          collect, use, and disclose personal information.
