<h3>If you send us an e-mail</h3>

<p>If you send us an e-mail containing personal information we take steps to ensure the confidentiality of that information. The content of e-mails is sometimes monitored for maintenance and fault detection purposes or for legal compliance purposes.</p>

<h3>Security of personal information</h3>

<p>Security of personal information is important to us and we take all reasonable precautions to protect personal information for misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>

<p>Some of the ways we protect personal information include:</p>

    <li>restricting access to personal information only to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;</li>
