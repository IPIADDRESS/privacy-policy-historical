            <p>
                Because we value your patronage, we want to address any privacy concerns you may
                have. To that end, we have set forth our privacy policy for handling the information
                you share with us online. We want your decision to do business with us to be an
                informed one.
            </p>

                    <h5>Collecting Information</h5>
                    <p>
                        When you visit our Website, we may collect information about you that you voluntarily
                        choose to share with us. This identification information may include, but is not
                        limited to, your name, your physical address, your e­mail address, your telephone
                        and fax numbers, details of your real estate and lending needs and preferences,
                        and other details of your life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What may be less obvious to you is that, when you visit our Website, we may collect
                        data involving your usage through the use of “cookies” (i.e. small text files placed
                        on your computer by a Website), Web server logs, and other Web tools. This technology
                        allows us to customize your online experience, as well as track your Internet use.
                        The tracking data we collect may include, but is not limited to, the date and time
                        you visit, the time you spend, the Web pages you view, the other Websites you visit,
                        your search queries, and basic information about your computer, such as your Internet
                        Protocol (“IP”) address, your domain name, your browser type, and the name of your
                        Internet service provider. You may deactivate cookies if you do not want your browsing
                        to be tracked, but doing so may hinder your online experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When visiting our Website, you may be directed, through hyperlinks, to other Websites
                        that are beyond our control. Furthermore, when you are visiting our Website, other
                        companies, such as third party advertisers and sponsors, may be gathering information
                        about you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by those
                        other companies and Websites. Although we encourage third parties to provide their
                        own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their activities, such as how they
                        handle the information they collect online.

                    <h5>Using Information Collected</h5>
                    <p>
                        We primarily use the identification information you voluntarily share with us to
                        customize your online experience and to do what you have asked of us. We also use
                        your identification information to tell you about our products and services, but
                        you may instruct us not to send communications to you by following the procedure
                        indicated below under “Contacting Us.” On occasion, we use your identification information
                        to validate your identity. As for usage tracking data, we primarily use that information
                        to operate and improve our Website, and to further our marketing efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a general rule, we do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties.
                        We may, however, share your information with our own personnel and our service providers
                        to the extent necessary to fulfill your requests. We may also share your information
                        with our affiliates, but we will not share it with unaffiliated third parties for
                        direct marketing purposes. We reserve the right to disclose your information under
                        limited circumstances, such as to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities
                        as required by law or legal process, to protect our own legal rights, or to protect
                        the public good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whenever you are online, you run the risk that the information you give out will
                        fall into the wrong hands. Although we implement and maintain reasonable security
                        procedures and practices to safeguard your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security
                        of any information you provide to us. We accept no responsibility or liability for
                        the activities of third parties.

                        our Website, or to change that information, you can make that request by following
