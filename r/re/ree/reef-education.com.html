We may supplement the information we collect from you with information we receive about you from other sources; if we combine this data with Student Data, it will be treated as Student Data.</p>

<div id="onlinetracking"></div>
<p><strong>Online Tracking</strong><br>
Our Sites use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you close your browser, they are deleted. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last beyond each visit to the Sites and remain on your hard drive after you close your browser. The cookies used on the Sites include those that are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies) and remember your choices (functionality cookies), and for visitors to our catalog Sites, cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising (described more below).</p>
<p>We may use the information we obtain from cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to recognize your computer when you visit the Sites</li>
<li>to track you as you navigate the Sites, and to enable the use of e-commerce capabilities</li>
<li>to improve the Sites’ usability</li>
<li>to analyze use of the Sites</li>
<li>to manage the Sites</li>
<li>to personalize the Sites, including for visitors to our catalog Sites, to enable targeted advertisements that may be of particular interest to you (excluding Students)</li>
<li>to recognize you when you move between devices so that your work can be synchronized</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may use “web beacons” on some of our Sites. A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies to our service providers’ servers, such as the server of Google Adwords. These web beacons enable our service providers to compile information about your browsing activity on the Sites. We do not share with third parties (other than our service providers), Personally Identifiable Information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission.</p>
<p>On some of our Sites and where permitted by law, we partner with third party advertising companies who may utilize cookies, web beacons or other technologies to provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you, or to serve advertisements about other products on our Sites. The third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services, as well as across different devices. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted advertising. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Sites. Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.</p>
<p>NOTE FOR STUDENT DATA: While some of our Sites collect information for advertising purposes, we do not collect or use Student Data for these purposes, nor do we deliver targeted advertising to Students. We may, however, display to Students contextual advertisements on our Sites and engage in other advertising activities, as permitted by law, e.g., with the appropriate opt-in from the Student or parent/guardian, as applicable.</p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services on our Sites, such as Google Analytics and ClickTale. These service providers help us analyze how users use our Sites. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. These service providers may retain and use Anonymous Information collected from users of our Sites in connection with their own businesses, including in order to improve their products and services. To learn more about opting out of data collection through Google Analytics or Click Tale, click the links below:</p>
<p>These Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.</p>
