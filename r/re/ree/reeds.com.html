            <p>We are committed to maintaining your privacy. </p>
            <p>The Internet contains a wealth of information. Unfortunately, it 
            may also contain personal details you do not want publicly shared. 
            For example, your real name (many people on the Internet use 
            aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, phone number, or 
            e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering 
            information about you without your knowledge. </p>
            <p>At Reeds.com, we respect your right to confidentiality, and are 
            committed to protecting your privacy. The information we gather on 
            our Web site is used to process your order efficiently and 
            effectively, and to determine the products and services that will be 
            of most value to you. To ensure your privacy, it is our policy not 
            to sell or rent our mailing list to anyone or any company. </p>
            <p>As an AOL Certified Merchant, we have agreed to abide by the 
            principles outlined in AOL's Privacy Policy at the following URL: 
            <a href="http://legal.web.aol.com/policy/aolpol/privpol.html">http://legal.web.aol.com/policy/aolpol/privpol.html</a>.

            <p><b><font color="#999966">Information We Collect and How It’s Used</font></b></p>
            <p><strong>Your IP Address <br></strong>An Internet Protocol (IP) 
            address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
            every time you browse the Internet. When users request a page from 
            our site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use your 
            IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to 
            administer our Web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything 
            personally identifiable. This means that a user session will be 
            tracked, but the user will be anonymous. </p>
            <p><strong>Cookies <br></strong>"Cookies" are pieces of data your 
            browser stores on your computer's hard drive. They enable us to 
            determine when you — or someone using the same browser you 
            previously used — revisits Reeds. Cookies also enable us to create a 
            more personalized shopping experience for you. </p>
            <p>Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually 
            change your browser settings to refuse them. Reeds does not use 
            cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your 
            computer. </p>
            <p><strong>Your Account <br></strong>When you set up an account with 
            Reeds, we will ask you for information about how to contact you, 
            your preferred method of payment, and your preferred shipping 
            address. If necessary, we use your contact information to reach you 
            for help processing an order you have placed. We may ask for 
            demographic and interest-based information when you create an 
            account. Whether you provide such information is purely optional. We 
            may, from time to time, use this information to send those on our 
            mailing list notices about upcoming events and promotions. </p>
            <p><strong>Other Information We Collect <br></strong>When you 
            purchase a product or make an offer on a product, we ask you for 
            information such as name, address, and credit card information. We 
            store and use this information so we can process your order. If 
            necessary, we may use this information to contact you for help 
            processing the order. Whenever you send us personal correspondence, 
            such as e-mail or letters, we may collect and store such 
            information. This ensures more efficient customer service and 
            enables us to provide you with the most current information 
            concerning your account. </p>
            <p><strong>About Children</strong><br>For their protection, children 
            are not eligible to use Reeds’ services. Because we are not a 
            children's site, we do not provide most of the privacy measures that 
            are so important for their protection on the Internet. Because of 
            this, we ask that minors do not submit any information to Reeds 
            without the expressed consent and participation of a parent or 
            guardian. </p>
            <p><strong>Removing Your Information from Our Records</strong><br>If for some reason, you 
            want us to remove your credit card and contact information from our 
            database, we will — after all of your transactions have been 
            completed. Simply follow the instructions given on the Web site 
            while accessing your account, or contact us at: 1-800-545-7977 or 
            (910) 350-3200. Such information, however, is never completely 
            removed from our database archives because we routinely back up our 
            servers for disaster recovery and tax-record purposes. </p>
            <p><strong><font color="#999966">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</font></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Personal Information </strong><br>Personal information 
            includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, method of 
            payment information and other data that identifies you as an 
            individual. </p>
            <p>Your personal information is used by Reeds, our suppliers and 
            shippers in order to process and ship your orders. Reeds does not 
            sell, trade, rent or release your personal information to third 
            parties. </p>
            <p><strong>Data Security</strong><br>Many steps have been taken in 
            order to prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and 
            guarantee proper use of information. To ensure this, we have placed 
            appropriate devices, as well as secure personnel and management in 
            charge of your personal information so that we can safeguard all 
            information we collect online. We do not use or share any personally 
            identifiable information provided to us online in any ways other 
            than those previously specified without also giving you the 
            opportunity to prohibit or opt-out of such uses. </p>
            <p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>Reeds occasionally 
            shares aggregate data about customers, traffic patterns, sales, and 
            other site information with partners, vendors, and other reputable 
            third parties. This data, however, does not contain any personally 
            identifying information such as email, telephone numbers, names, or 
            addresses. For example, we do not disclose that you purchased a 
            specific product, but we may share statistics on how many customers 
            have purchased a specific product. </p>
            <p><strong>Legal Issues</strong><br>Reeds discloses personal 
            information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that 
            such action is necessary to: <br><font size="4"><strong>· 
            </strong></font>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a 
            legal process served on Reeds or its Web site; <strong><font size="4">· </font></strong>Protect and defend the rights or property 
            of Reeds, the site, or the users of Reeds; <br><strong><font size="4">· </font></strong>And act under exigent circumstances to 
            protect the personal safety of users of Reeds, its Web site, or the 
            public. </p>
            <p><b><font color="#999966">Credit Card Security</font></b></p>
            <p>Shopping on the Internet is incredibly safe. </p>
            <p>At Reeds, we ensure that it is safe by transferring all of your 
            personal information, including your name, address and credit card, 
            over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your 
            information is encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels 
            over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your 
            order. You will know you're in secure mode when the tiny padlock 
            icon — located at the bottom of your browser — appears as "locked." 
            </p>
            <p>You also can verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL 
            line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first 
            characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 
            After the information reaches Reeds, it is stored on a secure 
            server, which means it resides behind a firewall and cannot be 
            accessed from outside the company. At that point, your information 
            can only be accessed by employees to process your orders. All such 
            employees sign a privacy/security policy, which provides legal 
            confidentiality protections for our customers. Violations of this 
            policy result in disciplinary actions, including the possibility of 
            termination, criminal prosecution and civil action. </p>
            <p>Your Reeds account is password-protected so that only you can 
            access it and view the member information relevant to the account. 
            We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Reeds 
            will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or 
            e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy 
            of your passwords and any account information. </p>
            <p>Remember to sign out of your Reeds account and close your browser 
            window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that 
            others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if 
            your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer 
            with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. </p>
