<p><strong>Cookies And Other Technical Information</strong></p>
<p>We send “cookies” to your computer primarily to enhance your  online experience and to store visitors’ preferences, record which session  information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or  visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them  when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to  provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors  are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, customize site content based on  visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Cookies are files that can identify you as a  unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical  information (including click through and click stream data).

<p>We may also use “Web beacons” that monitor your use of our  sites. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for  delivering a graphic image on a Web page for the purpose of transferring data,  such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the  page on which the Web beacon appears, the time the page containing the Web  beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon and the  identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that  server.
