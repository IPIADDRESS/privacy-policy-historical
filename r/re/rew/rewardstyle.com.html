    <h2 id="cookies-tracking">5.	Cookies / Tracking Technologies.</h2>
    <p><em>We collect data through cookies and other tracking technologies.  For more information about cookies, see our <a href="https://www.liketoknow.it/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a>.</em></p>
    <p>We may use cookies, pixels, scripts, etags, advertising IDs, IFA/IDFA, log files, clear gifs, web beacons, deep linking or other technology. We may use these technologies in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tracking Sales to Consumers;</li>
      <li>Facilitating Commissions to Influencers;</li>
      <li>Creation of user profiles;</li>

    <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Services. Turning off and/or deleting cookies does not affect other tracking technologies, such as device fingerprinting.</p>
    <p><strong>This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies and other tracking technologies by these Services only.</strong></p>
    <p>rS or an affiliate network (each an "Affiliate Network Partner") may drop cookies on a consumer’s device and/or web browser. For example, once an Influencer grabs a Product or Merchant link from our Services, visitors to that Influencer’s website who click on the particular link will be directed by rS or the Affiliate Network Partner to a Merchant’s e-commerce site, at which point rS or the Affiliate Network Partner drops a cookie on the visitor’s browser. These cookies are dropped so that our Services can monetize visits to our Influencers and other actions.</p>
    <p>rewardStyle may also utilize third party tracking technology, such as deep linking, to leverage cross-app and cross-site functionality.</p>
    <p>Another tracking technology is a script that collects device information to permit what is known as device fingerprinting. (see, e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0042-online-tracking?utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">FTC Consumer Guide on Online Tracking</a>&nbsp;- What is device fingerprinting?) For example, this data collection may permit generation of device fingerprints and cross-device profiles to better understand who visits particular Influencers, how often, unique visits, repeat visits, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>You agree rS is not liable for the content or use of personal information by third parties, including, without limitation, SNS, Influencers and Merchants, and including their use of cookies and other tracking technologies. Users and Consumers should consult the privacy policies and terms of service for those individual websites.</strong></p>
    <p>By agreeing to the terms of this Policy and by using our Services, you consent to the cookies and other tracking technologies referenced above.&nbsp;<strong>It is your responsibility to inform your visitors of the relevant data collection, use and disclosure practices through a privacy policy – see Section 8.</strong>&nbsp;In order for you to be a registered and active user of the Services, you must agree to accept cookies and other tracking technologies and to post a privacy policy. If you wish to opt-out of cookies and other tracking technologies altogether, send an email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@rewardstyle.com">info@rewardstyle.com</a>&nbsp;to request your account be deleted.</p>
