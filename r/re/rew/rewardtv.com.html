The purpose of this privacy policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Please read the following to learn more about our data collection policies and practices.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="types_info_collected" style="display: none;">
					<div class="sect">Types of Information Collected</div>
					<br>
					<p>The following are the types of information we collect:</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Information You Provide Us</p>
					<p>When you register to become a Member, RewardTV collects from you some personal information, including your name, email address, physical address, birth date, gender, zip code or other information that may be collected on the Site. When you play a RewardTV Game, you may be asked questions regarding your television and advertising viewing preferences, and your responses are collected by us. You must be at least 13 years of age to become a Member (see "A Special Note To Parents Concerning Privacy" below).</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Site Usage Information</p>
					<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect a log file which contains your IP address, browser type, domain name, click-stream data and the time of your visit. This information is used to measure and analyze Site usage and performance. In addition, when you visit a third-party site with which we have a marketing relationship, we may assign a randomly generated number and store that information as a browser cookie. The random number stored contains no non-public personal information about you or your machine.  We may cause our software to query that cookie and to log the random number along with the time and along with other data supplied to us. This information is used to better understand and serve RewardTV members. Data from unregistered users is not tracked, used or published by us in any context for any purpose. If you are a RewardTV member, data collected from your use of the Site and third party sites with which we have a marketing relationship may be aggregated with data from other RewardTV members and such aggregate data about our members may be published, but no such published information will contain any personally-identifiable information about you.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Email Communications</p>
					<p>We keep a record of what emails you opt to, and opt not to, receive from RewardTV.  You may opt in or out of receiving email from RewardTV at any time by signing into the Site, clicking on "My Account," clicking on "View or Edit Your Member Profile," logging into your account, and checking or unchecking the boxes listed under "Email Notification" and "Auction Notification."</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="how_info_collected" style="display: none;">
					<div class="sect">How Information is Collected</div>
					<br>
					<p>We collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including those described below:</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Registration</p>
					<p>Before using the Site, you will be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information. You may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may offer, including, but not limited to, games, contests, sweepstakes, auctions and surveys.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">RewardTV TV Trivia Games</p>
					<p>When you play a RewardTV Game, you may be asked questions regarding your television and advertising viewing preferences.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Sweepstakes, Contests, Instant Win Games, and Auctions</p>
					<p>We may operate sweepstakes, contests, instant win games, and auctions through the Site which may require separate registration, additional information or answers to certain questions.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Surveys or Voting Polls</p>
					<p>We will request personally identifiable information from you via Surveys or Voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Email Communications</p>
					<p>We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site.  You may opt in or out of receiving email from RewardTV at any time by signing into the Site, clicking on "My Account," clicking on " View or Edit Your Member Profile," logging into your account, and checking or unchecking the boxes listed under "Email Notification" and "Auction Notification."  In some instances, you may also opt in or out of receiving email from RewardTV in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails. When you open an HTML-formatted email (a message that includes graphics) from the Site, we include a Web Beacon (an electronic image known as a "single-pixel GIF") that will send us a confirmation that you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Sign Up a Friend Program</p>
					<p>The "Sign Up a Friend" Program allows you the opportunity to earn additional TV Points by inviting your friends to join RewardTV. The email addresses you submit to the program are sent a one-time email invitation to register on the Site. The email addresses are stored solely for the purpose of tracking any subsequent registrations on the Site so we may award you additional TV Points you earn as a result of these referrals. The email addresses are not disclosed to any third parties and will not be sent any other emails from RewardTV unless they opt in to receive such mailings at the time of registration. Your friends may contact us at <a href="/help/services.sdo" class="bluebold">http://www.rewardtv.com/help/services.sdo</a> to request that we remove their information from our database.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Security Practices</p>
					<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Cookies</p>
					<p>As with many Web sites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords and preferences. Cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, you will be unable to participate in any of the TV Trivia Games or other promotions on the Site if you have disabled the use of cookies. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by RewardTV only and does not cover the use of cookies by any of our partners.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</p>
					<p>We collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Co-branded Pages</p>
					<p>Certain pages on the Site reside on third-party Web sites but are displayed within the frame of the Site ("Co-branded Pages").  The pages within the TV Listings section of the Site are Co-branded Pages that reside on Zap2It.com (Tribune Media Services). The information collected in the TV Listings section is shared with Zap2It.com (Tribune Media Services) solely for the purpose of providing you with customized daily television listings.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Other Web Sites Displaying Content of RewardTV or Our Marketing Partners </p>
					<p>When you visit a third-party site with which we have a marketing relationship or when you visit a web site displaying content (including advertisements) of a third party with which we have a marketing relationship, we may assign a randomly generated number and store that information as a browser cookie. The random number stored contains no non-public personal information about you or your machine. We may cause our software to query that cookie and to log the random number along with the time and along with other data supplied to us. The ways in which we use this data are described above in the section entitled "Site Usage Information."
</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Links to Other Web Sites</p>
					<p>You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other Web sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Web site that is linked to our Site, you should consult that Web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
