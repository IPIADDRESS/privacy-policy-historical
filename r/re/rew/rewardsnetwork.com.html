  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">Our pledge to you, our member</h5>
  		    <p>Rewards Network Inc. and its affiliates (referred to herein as <strong>"we"</strong>, <strong>"us"</strong> and <strong>"our"</strong>) respect your privacy and want you to know how information about you is collected and shared. We have prepared this privacy policy (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) describing how we collect and disclose personally identifiable information about you (<strong>"Personal Information"</strong>).</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy so that you can make informed decisions about using our services. By participating in one of our Rewards Network programs (the <strong>"Rewards Network"</strong>), you agree to these provisions. This Privacy Policy applies to current and former members in the Rewards Network. The companies in our corporate family (called <strong>"affiliates"</strong>), when this Policy was updated, are listed for you at the end of the Privacy Policy.</p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">Your Privacy Protections</h5>
  		    <p>We take several steps to protect your Personal Information. Among other things:

</p><ul>
  <li>We will not disclose your Personal Information to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing that party's goods or services without your consent. </li><br><br>
  <li>We will give you access to information we maintain on your name, how to contact you, credit cards you have registered with the Rewards Network, and certain other preferences you have registered with us ("Registration Information"), and we will allow you to correct any inaccuracies; and </li><br><br>
  <li>We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the Personal Information we collect about you. </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">What Personal Information We Collect</h5>
  		    <p>We gather the following types of Personal Information in connection with the provision of our services to you.

</p><ul>
  <li> <u>Information you voluntarily provide to us.</u> For example, when you register to participate in the Rewards Network, you may provide us with Personal Information.</li><br><br>
  <li> <u>Information about your transactions with us or with others.</u> For example, we collect Personal Information and transactions from payment card companies, payment card processors and merchants that accept your credit card as payment for goods or services, including merchants that are participating in the Rewards Network or that have agreed to help us evaluate our program.  We may also collect Personal Information from merchants or other parties who do not participate in the Rewards Network.</li><br><br>
  <li> <u>Information obtained about you from others.</u> For example, we work with firms that provide us demographic information or that enroll you in the Rewards Network (like a credit card company or airline). </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">What Personal Information We Disclose</h5>
  		    <p>We do not disclose any Personal Information to nonaffiliated third parties, except as necessary for the nonaffiliated third party to provide services to us (such as printing or mailing services) or as permitted by law. This means that we will not disclose your Personal Information (such as your telephone number) to nonaffiliated third parties for such parties' use in marketing its goods or services without your consent.</p>

<p>However, since we may disclose information as permitted by law, we may, for example, disclose Personal Information in connection with giving you credit for rewards, carrying out a transaction you have requested, operating or managing our business, or responding to legal process.</p>

<p>We may obtain your consent to share information with third parties in various ways. For example, we may invite you to participate in a survey or special promotional program offered by a third party and your choice to participate in such a survey or promotional program will indicate your consent for us to share information with third parties in connection with the survey or promotional program.</p>

<p>We also may disclose any Personal Information we collect with our affiliates. However, we will not disclose with our affiliates any Personal Information that is collected or used to determine eligibility for credit, insurance, or employment (such as a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency), except as permitted by law or to affiliates that provide services for us, unless we give you the right to ask us not to do so.</p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">Anonymous Information</h5>
  		    <p>We may share information that is not personally identifiable to you ("Anonymous Information"), including aggregated demographic and statistical information, with our affiliates, partners, merchants, and others. Such information could be used, for example, to provide us with statistical or other analysis. None of this Anonymous Information can be linked by the recipient to any Personal Information that can identify you.</p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">Communicating With You</h5>
  		    <p>We may from time to time send special offers to you on behalf of selected companies which we think may be of interest to you. However, because we or our third party vendors (and not the selected company) would send such offers to you, it is not necessary to disclose Personal Information to the company in order to send these offers to you. We also may send you offers for goods or services sold by us or our affiliates, including in our e-mail newsletters, by e-mail or ordinary mail, or by telephone.</p>

<p>We will allow you to choose not to receive these marketing communications from us. For example, if you do not want to receive our dining e-mail newsletters, or other dining e-mail marketing communications from us, you may unsubscribe or opt out from such dining marketing communications by clicking the link included at the bottom of each e-mail message we send to you. You also can choose to not receive special offers we send on behalf of other companies. Please read the section entitled "Reviewing, Changing Your Information or Unsubscribing" for details on how to request not to receive these marketing communications.</p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">"E-mail a Friend" and "Refer a Friend" Information</h5>
  		    <p>You may use our E-mail a Friend service to send restaurant links to family and friends via e-mail. Rewards Network will automatically send a one-time e-mail inviting your family and friends to visit the specific restaurant page on rewardsnetwork.com. Your family and friends may <a href="/contactus.jsp">contact us</a> to request that their information be removed.</p>

<p>You may use our Refer a Friend service to refer your family and friends to become members of Rewards Network. Rewards Network will automatically send a one-time email inviting your family and friends to visit rewardsnetwork.com and become members of our program. Your family and friends may <a href="/contactus.jsp">contact us</a> to request that their information be removed.</p>
  	    	
    	
  	    
      	
  	    
  		    <h5 class="SectionHeadline">Operating Our Web site (Including How We Use Cookies)</h5>
  		    <p>When you visit our site without logging in, we may collect usage information ("session data"), but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. We may use session data for a variety of reasons, including to better understand things like how our site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at our site, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors, and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to our site.</p>

<p>When you visit our site and login, we may collect usage information ("persistent data"), that will be linked to your user name and password. We may use the persistent data for a variety of reasons, including to monitor your use of our site in conjunction with your participation in one of our programs.</p>

<p>We use cookies on our web site to collect session data and persistent data for several purposes, such as to personalize and improve your individual viewing experiences on our site. Cookies placed on your computer by www.rewardsnetwork.com can only be read by the <a href="/index.jsp">www.rewardsnetwork.com</a> web server. We use two different types of cookies in our web site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Session cookies" track the user's progression through our sites and session data in a single visit. These cookies enable us to remember things as the user progresses from one page to another. Your session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your browser. In addition, if you leave your browser open for a prolonged period, they are set to automatically erase themselves after a short period. </li><br>

  <li>"Persistent cookies" remember a user and the user's persistent data at the user's next visit to our web site. Your persistent cookies are not automatically erased, and they remain on your computer until you erase them. (If you do not want these cookies to remain on your computer, you can erase them by following the steps for your specific browser.) For members, we may use a persistent cookie to remember such things as your User Name, name, preferred dining area, selected cuisine type and other promotional links that you clicked on while on the site. </li>
</ul>

<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit.</p>

<p>Rewards Network may also use a third party to place cookies on your computer to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our web site in order to constantly improve the web site quality.</p>

<p>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
