All personal information, as further described below, that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. REFOG reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will prominently post any material changes on the home page of the Website.

When you are on the REFOG Website, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. These other sites may independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own “cookies” to you. REFOG is not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data created when using such third party sites.</p> <p>The REFOG Website may also contain advertising and other links to other web sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. Also we do not send random marketing emails to personal email addresses (spam). The REFOG Website may contain hyper links to external web sites owned and operated by third parties. REFOG has no control over or association with such third party sites and REFOG is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness and quality of the information contained within them. Any and all contents on these external web sites do not reflect products, services or information provided by REFOG. You should direct any concerns regarding any external link to the site administrator or webmaster of such site. REFOG will inform you before you will be redirected to such third party sites and that REFOG will notify when you leave its Website and/or provide indication that you are directed to such other third party websites.</p> <h3>Legal Issues</h3> <p>This Website may be subject to the laws of various jurisdictions, including the laws of the United States of America, European and other jurisdiction because the access to our Website may use internet traffic of different jurisdictions, including without limitation the United States of America and EU. REFOG will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to REFOG guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this Website), or to others. As mentioned above, laws related to personal identifiable information vary by country. For example, personally identifiable information collected in the European Union and its Member States is subject to the EU Directives concerning personal data, privacy and electronic communications, including but not limited to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the subsequent legislation adopted in the EU Member States.</p> <p>REFOG may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities.

However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. REFOG will inform on the mandatory and/or optional character of the requested and/or required information.</p> <p>REFOG will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our Website and the subsequent legislation adopted in the United States or EU Member States.</p> <p>When you use the Website, REFOG or third parties authorized by REFOG may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to REFOG every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the “Refer”), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by REFOG and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p> <p>We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services. REFOG also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.</p> <p>When you submit personal information to REFOG through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which REFOG and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of REFOG. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p> <p>REFOG may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website. Typically, these providers would offer services that REFOG customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with REFOG services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's Website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. For instances, the credit card information may be entered as part of the filling out the purchase form or registration process is collected by the third parties registration and/or merchant services and subject to their respective privacy policies. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with REFOG personal information collected from you.

You may also access and change your personal information and privacy preferences by contacting us at: privacy@refog.com.</p> <h3>Information Relating to Children</h3> <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/. The REFOG Website and any products or services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase products and services, or download software programs. The collection of information is covered above. Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting us by letter (using the address information provided at the bottom of this page).</p> <h3>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</h3> <p>REFOG operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. REFOG takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.</p> <p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches REFOG it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of REFOG. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where REFOG and its service providers conduct business. All REFOG employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p> <h2>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2> <h3>How your personal information is used</h3> <p>REFOG collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of REFOG and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.</p> <p>REFOG may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. REFOG may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p> <p>REFOG recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, REFOG will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from REFOG or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, REFOG will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p> <p>However, you should be aware that some of your contact information in advertisements and postings may be visible for all other visitors, and we cannot guarantee that someone will not use it for commercial or other purposes or activities.</p> <h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3> <p>REFOG may use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of REFOG. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose REFOG specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the REFOG’s affiliates for their use without your approval.</p> <p>REFOG may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. REFOG may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.</p> <p>In the event that all or substantially all of REFOG’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, REFOG may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.</p> <h3>Choices available to you</h3> <p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the REFOG Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such services. </p> <p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from REFOG or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to “opt out” we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.</p> <p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.</p> <p>REFOG is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. </p> <p>When you create a personal account with REFOG and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.
