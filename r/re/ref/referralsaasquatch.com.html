<li>Your service usage; and</li>
<li>Internet Protocol address.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you provide us with your personal information, we will inform you as to why we are collecting it.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may ask you to provide us with more detailed information regarding your interests in order to serve you better and understand what features and services may be of interest to you. It will be entirely up to you as to whether you choose to share this information with us.</p>
<p>Also, if you send us an e-mail message, we may retain that message and your e-mail address, as well as any response we send you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How We Use Your Personal Information</strong></span></p>

<p>Except with your consent, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others.</p>
<p>Yupiq&nbsp;may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services (including but not limited to website development and hosting, data processing, credit card processing, document management, marketing, customer management and office administration) to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above.&nbsp; These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by Yupiq&nbsp;and to comply with the general privacy principles describes in this Privacy Policy.</p>
