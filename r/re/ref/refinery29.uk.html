        <h1>Your Privacy Rights</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 08/12/2016</p>
        <p>Refinery 29 Inc. in the U.S.A. and Refinery 29 Limited registered in England and Wales under company number 08279936 and with registered office at 10 John Street, London, WC1N 2EB, United Kingdom (collectively, “Refinery29” or “we”) take your privacy extremely seriously. This privacy policy describes how we treat and use the information we collect when you visit or use our websites Refinery29.com, Refinery29.uk, and Refinery29.demobile-optimized versions of the websites, or software applications to which this policy is linked (collectively, “Website”), including when you sign-up for our newsletters.  Our UK entity manages the UK and German section of our Website and our U.S.A. entity manages the U.S.A. section.</p>

        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Children.</strong> We do not offer the Website to anyone under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Website. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any personal information on or through the Website, register on the Website, or use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, email address or any screen name or user name you may use.</p>

        <p><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> We generally collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide. For instance, contact information, and other personal details may be collected when you: sign up for our newsletters, create an account/register on our Website, complete a survey, post a comment to an article on our Website, enter a sweepstakes or contest, or participate in our social networking features. Further, you may be asked to provide your email address, your name, buying preferences, annual income (by accepting to participate in surveys), or other demographic or profile information (by accepting to participate in surveys), Twitter or Facebook usernames or other usernames and aliases used for purposes of linking to and/or posting on your social media accounts, and other information you choose to submit. We will collect such information as well as any other content that you provide to us in engaging in any of the above activities or any other activities on the Website. Additionally, if you elect to post material to any blogs, forums, or participate in our community boards that may be offered on our Website, then such materials will be collected and may be publicly available for others to view. Even after you terminate your account, all such materials submitted by you on the Website or our social media channels may be retained by us and we may continue to disclose such materials publicly.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Information We Collect.</strong> On the U.S. section of our Website and, subject to your prior consent, on the U.K. and German sections, we and other parties may also collect certain information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking), such as pages visited and how often and for how long they are visited. We may use various technologies and features to collect this information, which may include personal information, such as tracking your activities through your Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer settings or most-recently visited URL, as well as through the use of “cookies” and “web beacons” and other automated technologies. You may object to the creation of usage profiles at any time.</p>

        <p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals.</strong> Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) mechanisms, we currently do not respond to web browser DNT signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We may revisit our policy on responding to these signals, in which case we will post a revised privacy policy on this site. See “Modifications” below.</p>

        <p>Some of the network advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors we work with to serve ads on third party websites and across the internet, or analytics providers which provide us with information regarding use of our websites and effectiveness of our ads, may be members of the Network Advertising Initiatives, the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. To opt-out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of the participating companies, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.  For opt-out options specific to Google Analytics, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .  If you delete your cookies or upgrade your browser after having opted out, you will need to opt out again.  If you use multiple browsers or devices, you will need to execute this opt-out on each browser or device.  Users in Europe may review our <a href="http://www.refinery29.uk/cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a> for further information applicable to them regarding our use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.</p>

        <p><strong>Location Information.</strong> We, and enable our service providers and advertisers to, collect and share your location for personalization and marketing purposes via certain services we provide through digital applications, wireless access protocol services ("WAP Services") or mobile phone services. We, or the service provider, will obtain your prior consent to such collection to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
