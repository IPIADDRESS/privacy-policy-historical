<p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. Referral
Key operates by these principles to protect your privacy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your personal information will never 
be sold to third parties for any marketing purposes<br>
</li>
<li>You contact information and personal 
information will never be shared with another member or 
user without your consent.<br>
</li>
<li> We will only share your personal information 
with third parties to provide specific services. For example, 
we utilize credit card processing companies to bill Silver
or Gold Key members for monthly membership fees. These 
third party users do not store or retain any personally 
identifiable information except to provide these services 
and must adhere to strict confidentiality and privacy 
agreements which limit the use of such personal information.<br>
</li>
<li>We will not select other companies to 
send you information about their services and products.<br>
</li>
<li> You may cancel your membership or participation 
as a referral associate at any time. If you cancel your 
Referral Key membership or participation as a referral 
associate, we will remove your name and other personally 
identifiable information from public viewing. <br>
</li>
<li> We will use all industry protocols and 
technology to secure any sensitive information you provide.<br>
</li>
<li> To ensure that the personal information 
you provide to Referral Key is accurate and current, you 
may review and update your personal information at any 
time.<br>
</li>
<li> The Referral Key website is a vehicle 
by which business professionals people seek to provide 
referrals to one another. With our consent, all the personal 
and business information you enter onto the Referral Key 
website and choose to be displayed may be viewable by 
members and the general public.<br>
</li>
<li> By becoming a member of Referral Key

we may email you announcements and promotional information. 
If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, 
please send to requests to <a href="mailto:info@referralkey.com">info@referralkey.com</a>.<br>
</li>
<li> Referral Key may disclose general information 
about its members and their referral associates (demographics, 
business industry, job title, etc) but not individual 
personal information to third parties without the members 
or their referral associates permission.<br>
</li>
<li> Like many websites, Referral Key uses 
cookies and similar software to collect data about users 
to track their movements around the website and in order 
to help users to automatically and seamlessly sign in 
on subsequent visits to the site.<br>
</li>
<li> You have the option to manually enter, 
upload or import information about your contacts into 
the private “My Contacts” section of our website.

by you and will not be seen by others in the Referral 
Key network without your permission. The My Contacts section 
data is covered by all the terms of this privacy policy.<br>
</li>
<li> You MUST be 18 years to join Referral 
Key.<br>
</li>
<li> There is a possibility that we may need 
to disclose your personal information when required by 
law. We shall only disclose such information when we have 
a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with 
a court order or other legal proceeding.<br>
</li>

or comments about this privacy policy, please notify us
