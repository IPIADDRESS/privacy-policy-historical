    <p>Third-parties who provide us with products and services may also place cookies, ad tags and/or beacons that
        collect the information outlined above in order to provide us with

    <p>These third parties may also collect information about you from other sources and combine it with other

        However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is
        currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means
        to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. However, our <a href="cookies">Cookie

    100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information
    we may have collected from or about you.
</p>

<div id="7" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">7) RETENTION</div>
<p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as

    of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period
    for personal information we process, we consider the amount, nature, and
    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
    information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether
    we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting
    requirements.
</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may aggregate and de-identify your information in such a way that you may not reasonably
    be re-identified by us or any other company in which case we may use
    this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="#8">ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION &amp; DELETION

<p><strong class="underline">Note regarding Search Results</strong>. Our search results list and link to content
    that exits on web pages that are most likely not owned or controlled by
    us and the same or similar results are likely available through other search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo!
    etc.). If content about you is included in search results
    displayed on our Sites, it only means that the information exists on the Internet and it doesn’t mean that we
    endorse it or have the ability to remove content available on
    any other site and/or block such sites. To remove the content from the site linked to in the search results you
    should contact the owner of that site.

        Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679)</a> (“<span class="underline">GDPR</span>”) natural persons
    (called data subjects) are afforded certain rights regarding their
    personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a
    portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal
    information. You also have the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us.
</p>

<p>If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to
    honor that request, please please make your request <a href=" https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. To assist us
    in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.
    Unless you have voluntarily provided to us any other information about you,
    the only information we collect and store is linked to a unique user identification number we have assigned to
    you via a cookie placed on your browser. Please click the button below

</div>

<p>Upon submitting your request to access or delete information we store about you, please provide your User ID
    number. This will enable us to process your request. </p>

<p>To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies
    your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document;
    a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. Please also obscure parts of the document such as identifying
    numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you.
    If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the
    identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the
    request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of
    your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will
    be reviewed by AMG’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to
    accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.
</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
    may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
    repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if
    your request is particularly complex or you have made a number
    of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
</p>

<p>We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about privacy. If,
    however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your
    complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your
    country of residence.
</p>

<div id="9" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">9) INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</div>

    States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers
    in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this
    Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>Further, if you are receiving the Services from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) your information may be
    transferred to, stored, and processed in a country that is not regarded
    as providing the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country, and may be
    available to the government of those countries under a lawful order
    made in those countries. However, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar
    degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the
    following safeguards is implemented:
</p>

<div class="indent">
    <ul>
        <li><span class="underline">Model Contracts. Where appropriate, we put in place specific contractual
                commitments in accordance with applicable legal requirements to provide adequate protections for

            provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EU and the US.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="10" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">10) PRIVACY SHIELD PARTICIPATION</div>

    the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection,
    use, and retention of personal information from European Union and Switzerland to the United States,
    respectively. Ask Media Group has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield

    have the right to request a list of all third parties to which a company conducting business in California has
    disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law

    affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to
    exercise your disclosure choice options. If you are a California resident and request information about how to
    exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference
    on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Contact us <a href=" https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, or you
