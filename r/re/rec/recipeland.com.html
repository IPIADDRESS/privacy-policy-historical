<p> 
<b>Note to children under the age of 13</b><br>
If you're under 13, you must provide us with written permission from your parents before sending any information about yourself to us over the Internet. 
</p>
<p> 

<b>Information collected and how it is used</b><br>
RecipeLand.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent your information to others in any way different from what is disclosed in this statement. RecipeLand.com collects voluntary information from you at several different points on our website. This information is used to enhance your experience on our web site.
</p>

<p> 
We collect information in the following areas: 
</p>
<p> 
<b>I. Registration</b><br>
RecipeLand.com does not collect your personal identifiable information unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site. However, you must register if you wish to use certain features on our site. 
</p>
<p> 
During registration you are required to give contact information (such as your name and email address). This information is used to provide the services that you have requested, or to contact you about the service on our site for which you have expressed interest. We may contact you from time to time with news as well as for internal marketing and promotional purposes. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Recipe submission</b><br>
Your personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes (such as attributing your submitted recipe to you). We may also use this information to contact you should we have any complications with your recipe. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Recipe request</b><br>
</p>

<p> 
When you subscribe to this feature, we ask for your name and email address and the description of the recipe that you are requesting. RecipeLand.com then posts your name and your recipe description to the site. The email address you provided is only used for us to contact you when your request has been filled. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Contest, Promotions and Surveys</b><br>
You must be a registered user in order to enter contests and promotions on RecipeLand.com. Participation in these events is completely voluntary and we do not require you to disclose this information.

</p>
<p>
From time to time our site requests information from you via surveys. This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and participation is completely at your discretion. 
</p>
<p>
<b>II. Cookies </b>
</p>
<p> Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the "cookie" itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. The "cookie" does not track your personal information or provide us with any way to contact you, and the "cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We use the "cookie" to provide functional information about your browser, allowing us to provide you a better experience. We also use "cookies" to gather broad demographic information and general usage patterns about you and other users of our sites. 
</p>
<p> 
If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing certain areas of our site, such as contests, coupons, recipe box, shopping list feature, etc. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site. See next reference: </b>

<p> 
                              RecipeLand.com, and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the
                              privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for
                              the responsible management of consumer information. 
														</p>
<p>
                              Consumer Information 
														</p>
<p>
                              During the process of delivering an ad to you, RecipeLand.com does not collect any
                              personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone
                              number, or e-mail address. However, RecipeLand.com does obtain some types of
                              non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you
                              use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer
                              operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information
                              collected by RecipeLand.com is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad
                              effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. 
														</p>
<p>
                              In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a
                              specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If
                              this does occur, RecipeLand.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser.
                              This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition,
                              RecipeLand.com may combine this information with other users' information and review it in
                              an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of
                              ad or visit a particular kind of website. 
														</p>
<p>
                              Data Collection
														</p>
<p>
                              RecipeLand.com, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" or any unique id provided by your device to enhance your
                              experience on the web. RecipeLand.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you
                              in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique
                              number that is provided to you the first time RecipeLand.com serves you an ad. This unique
                              number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps RecipeLand.com target ads
                              to you. This cookie can help RecipeLand.com ensure that we don't serve you the same ad
                              multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and don't like
                              about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you
                              are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance
                              your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and
                              delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for RecipeLand.com to deliver
                              you an ad. 

														</p>
<p>
                              If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually
                              delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for
                              more information.
