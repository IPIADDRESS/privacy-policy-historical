If you do not wish for personally identifiable information to be shared with the Site for the purposes described herein, do not provide or upload such information. Once you complete and submit your registration and so long as you are a registered user of the Site, you have opted in to receive email communication from us. In order to stop receiving email communication from us, you need to cancel and terminate your account with the Site.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Company may make your information and/or resume (including personally identifiable information) available to potential prospective employers. You may elect to prevent the Company from making such information available at any time by modifying your User Profile.</p>
          <p>Through the Site, we automatically gather certain information about the use of the Site, such as how frequently certain areas of the Site are visited, the date and time of Site visits, IP addresses and browser information, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies. Most browsers can be set to prevent cookies or to notify you when one is being placed; however, cookies are necessary to access and use the Site. Your browser may allow you to delete the cookies after using the Site.</p>
          <p>The Site also makes use of a technology designed to enhance your job search experience and to provide aggregate non-personally identifiable information about the use of the Site to us. If for any reason you do not wish to have this technology enabled while browsing the Site, please modify your User Profile preferences. A cookie will be set on your browser that instructs this technology not to start. If you have disabled this technology and wish to reactivate it, please modify your User Profile preferences. Please note that if you are accessing the Site through mobile applications, these links will not function and this technology will not be disabled.</p>
          <p>Certain personally identifiable information may also be provided by other registered users of the Site. If you choose to invite an individual to join the Site, you will need to provide certain personal information regarding such individual including his/her name and email address. We store this information to confirm qualifying participants attributable to your account and to track the results of the invitation referrals. Content (including advertising) provided by third parties to the Site may include cookies or other tracking technology to collect information regarding your online behavior which may be used to customize certain advertisements to you.</p>
          <h3>How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h3>
          <p>We will not use, share or disclose your information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise consented to by you.</p>
          <p>We use your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to administer your account and allow you to use the Site and its content (including through mobile applications). This use allows us to give you a more enjoyable, convenient job search experience and to help us identify and/or provide information that may be of interest to you. We use your information to support and enhance your use of the Site and its features, including without limitation: tracking email invitations you send, tracking companies to which you have applied, and otherwise supporting your use of the Site and its features. You may modify your selections with respect to who we share your personally identifiable information with by modifying your User Profile preferences.</p>
          <p>We also use your personally identifiable information for any purpose for which you provide it (for example, if you wish to share your email address with another registrant or potential employer). In addition, we may send you service or promotional communications, including notifying you about new services or employment opportunities or providing you with additional information relevant to your job search. Unless you elect not to share the information in your user profile, we may also provide your personally identifiable information to potential employers who are looking for candidates whose qualifications you may satisfy. We require these third parties to keep your personally identifiable information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</p>
          <p>Some of these strategic partnerships with third parties may result in direct communication from potential employers. You may modify your choices with respect to with whom we share your personally identifiable information by modifying your User Profile preferences.</p>
          <p>You should be aware we have no control over third-party websites or links which you may be invited to view or register, and our privacy policy does not apply to these third-party websites or links. Please consult the privacy policy of such websites or links you are visiting.</p>

          <p>We may use your information to contact you about our own and third-parties' goods and services we think may be of interest to you. You may modify whether your information is used for this purpose by modifying your User Profile preferences.</p>

          <p>We may use your information to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers' target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your personally identifiable information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria. We may disclose and transfer information (including personally identifiable information) as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business (whether as a going-concern or not) or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control.</p>

          <p>We reserve the right to disclose information in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of law, or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary in order to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property or to fight fraud and credit risk reduction.</p>

          <p>If you use a bulletin board, chat room or any other publicly accessible area of the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected or used by any person for any purpose. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable or other information you choose to submit in these forums. We may retain records of all bulletin board posts, chat room posts or any other publicly accessible areas of the Site in accordance with our data retention policy.</p>

          <p>We use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so we can improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable information.</p>
          <h3>Choices regarding Your Information</h3>
          <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding your personally identifiable information. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website. <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a> If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that the Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>
          <li>Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable or other information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for promotional or advertising purposes, you can opt-out by checking or unchecking the relevant box located on your registration form. If you change your mind at a later date, you can also opt-out by logging into the Site and adjusting your user profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes in your user profile or by sending us an e-mail stating your request to <a href="mailto:info@recsolu.com">info@recsolu.com</a>.</li>
          <li>Promotional Offers from the Company. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own or third-parties' products or services, you can opt-out by checking or unchecking the relevant box located on your registration form. If you change your mind at a later date, you can also opt-out by logging into the Site and adjusting your user profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes in your user profile or by sending us an e- mail stating your request to <a href="mailto:info@recsolu.com">info@recsolu.com</a>. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as a result of product service experience requests. We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3>
          <p>We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.</p>
          <p>Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We also urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site like message boards or forums. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by other users of the Site.</p>
          <h3>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences</h3>
          <p>If you are a registered user, you may access and update or correct your registration and other personal information and your preferences to receive email or other communications from us by logging into the Site and modifying your user profile or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@recsolu.com">info@recsolu.com</a>. Please note that your friends and contacts may still choose to send email invitations to you. Any user who receives an email invitation to join the Site may choose not to receive such invitations in the future by following the instructions in the email invitations; and, in addition, if you are a member, you may also choose not to receive such invitations by changing your preferences as indicated above. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us as we process your request.</p>
          <p>While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information, we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of your information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. Please note that in some instances we may not be able to delete your personal information except by deleting your user account. We will notify you if we are not able to accommodate your request or if we have elected to delete all or any portion of your information as a result of a failure to accommodate such request.</p>
          <h3>Children's Privacy and Parental Controls</h3>
          <p>We do not solicit any personal information from children. If you are not 16 or older, you are not authorized to use the Site. Parents should be aware there are parental control tools available online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.</p>
          <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Site that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@recsolu.com">info@recsolu.com</a>.</p>
          <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
          <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy for the Site, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here, and post a notice on the Site's home page indicating the Privacy Policy has changed, so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we may disclose it to anyone. If we make changes to how we treat your personal information, we will notify you by e-mail. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting the Site and this privacy policy to check for any changes. Your continued use of the Site indicates your assent to the Privacy Policy as posted.</p>
