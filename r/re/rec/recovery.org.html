		<h3> How Do We Protect Your Information? </h3>
		<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
			Onvia places a high value on the corporate data and document data you entrust with us. For this reason, we secure your information at three levels: <b>physical, application, and network layers</b>. The <b>physical</b> layer is protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate operations individuals. Additionally, the servers are caged within a data center only accessible through a three-factor security model. The <b>application</b> layer is entirely secured using Thawte’s 128 bit SSL encryption technology so applicable communication with the web site is locked. The <b>network layer</b> is protected by industry-leading firewall technology and administered real-time to ensure timely security patching. This layer is also watched by intrusion-monitoring systems to ward off unauthorized access. These safeguards all are put in place to protect our users' information, prevent unauthorized access, safeguard user data, and ensure the proper and legal use of the Site. Onvia takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and protect customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on our Site. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that information user's supply will be totally secure.

		<h3> Dispute Resolution </h3>
		<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
			Any dispute involving the use or retention of Personal Information by Onvia shall be resolved by appeal to the American Arbitration Association.
		</div>
		<h3> Linked Sites </h3>
		<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
			For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site that link to other Web sites not under Onvia’s control. We are not responsible for and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In addition, when you initiate a transaction on a web site that our Site links to, even if you reached that site through our Site, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site. You should read their privacy policies to understand how they use and protect personal information that they collect.
