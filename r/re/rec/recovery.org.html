<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>We are serious about protecting your privacy and recognize that
you care how information about you is used and shared. We
appreciate that you expect Onvia, Inc. to protect your personal
information carefully and sensibly. This Data Protection and
Privacy Policy notice ("Privacy Policy") describes how we may
collect personal information about you whether you are one of our
registered users ("Registered User") or a visitor to the Site. You
care what personal information we collect, how we may use it, with
whom we may share it, what choices you have regarding it, and how
we protect it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a
part of the Terms of Use of this Onvia web site ("Site") and we
encourage you to become familiar with the terms and conditions
contained herein. Any data processed by Onvia is only disclosed to
third parties at the request of our client, as required by law or
as provided below. <strong>By registering with Onvia and accessing
and/or using this Site, you agree that you have read and understand
this Privacy Policy, and that you accept and consent to the privacy
practices described in this Privacy Policy</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, Onvia may change its privacy practices
because of changes in relevant and applicable legal or regulatory
requirements, the business or business practices of Onvia, or in
its attempts to better serve your needs. Notice of such changes to
our privacy practices will be given and a revised Privacy Policy
will be posted at this location.</p>

<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>

<p>The information collected by Onvia is not ordinarily acquired in
a form or manner that permits the identification of an individual's
Personal Information by Onvia. Notwithstanding the above, Personal
Information may be supplied to Onvia by our clients' employees or
representatives and Registered Users. Onvia collects various types
of information from our Registered Users. During the registration
process, Registered Users supply us with basic contact information
(such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and
company name), as well as billing information. This information is
generally entered into fields in the registration and subscription
forms and enables the Registered User to take full advantage of the
products and services that we offer. Should you purchase any Onvia
products or services on or through the Site, the information that
you supplied during the registration process may be used to track
details about those purchases. "Personal Information" means any
information or set of information that identifies or could be used
by Onvia, its customers or agents of its customers, to identify an
individual. Personal Information does not include information that
is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that
has not been combined with non-public personal information.
"Sensitive Personal Information" means personal information that
reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns
health or sex life. Onvia does not require that Registered Users
supply Sensitive Personal Information as part of the registration
process or in any registration or subscription form. Onvia will
treat as Sensitive Personal Information any information received
from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the
information as sensitive.<br>
<br>
As with many other Web sites, the Web servers used to operate the
Onvia Site collect certain data pertaining to those that access the
Site and the equipment and communications method that are used to
access the Internet and the Site. Without combining these data with
other sources of information, they do not readily identify the
individual user. They do reveal such things as the Internet
protocol ("IP") address assigned to your computer, pages you
accessed on the Site, or immediately prior to visiting the Site,
and the length of time you spent at the Site. This information is
collected to, among other things, facilitate Site operation and
system administration, to generate aggregate, non-identifiable
statistical information, and to improve performance of the services
made available on the Site.<br>
<br>
Onvia may also retain the content of and metadata regarding any
correspondence you may have with Onvia or its customer service
representatives, regardless of the mode of communication by which
such correspondence was made. This information helps Onvia to
improve the Site and the materials, products and services offered
on the Site, and to more effectively and efficiently respond to
both current and future inquiries.<br>
<br>
Onvia uses "cookies" (small text files stored on your computer) to
help track and customize your access and use of the Site. Cookies
store and retain information that helps us recognize you on
subsequent visits to the Site. Cookies may also store any login or
ID assigned to you by Onvia and the associated password, this
information is stored in encrypted form. Most popular Internet
browser packages allow you to configure the browser so as not to
accept cookies. However, setting the browser to reject cookies may
prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site and the
materials, products and services that Onvia makes available on the
Site.</p>

<p><strong>How Do We Use The Information That We
Collect?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the uses mentioned or described above, Onvia uses
the information that it collects to improve the materials, products
and services that Onvia makes available on the Site, to notify
Registered Users of changes made to the Site or new products made
available on or through the Site, to evaluate customer needs and
customize Site content delivered according to those needs, to
facilitate the processing of any purchases made through the Site,
to send promotional material from Onvia, and for other legitimate
and lawful business purposes of Onvia. <strong>Onvia does not share
Personal Information collected about its Registered Users with
third parties. It is our policy not to sell lists containing
Personal Information about Site users, registrants or
subscribers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What Choices Do You Have?</strong></p>

<p>Registered Users may update at any time the information about
the user and user preferences that are stored on the Site or during
registration. Registered Users may also ask us at any time to
remove the user's name from our list of Site users who wish to

<p><strong>How Do We Protect Your Information?</strong></p>

<p>Onvia places a high value on the corporate data and document
data you entrust with us. For this reason, we secure your
information at three levels: <strong>physical, application, and
network layers</strong>. The <strong>physical</strong> layer is
protected by need-to-know authorization by only the appropriate
operations individuals. Additionally, the servers are caged within
a data center only accessible through a three-factor security
model. The <strong>application</strong> layer is entirely secured
using Thawte's 128 bit SSL encryption technology so applicable
communication with the web site is locked. The <strong>network
layer</strong> is protected by industry-leading firewall technology
and administered real-time to ensure timely security patching. This
layer is also watched by intrusion-monitoring systems to ward off
unauthorized access. These safeguards all are put in place to
protect our users' information, prevent unauthorized access,
safeguard user data, and ensure the proper and legal use of the
Site. Onvia takes commercially reasonable measures to secure and
protect customer-specific information transmitted via or stored on
our Site. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot
guarantee that information user's supply will be totally
secure.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>

<p>Onvia will conduct periodic compliance audits of its relevant
privacy practices to verify adherence to our policies. Any employee
that Onvia determines is in violation of its policies will be
subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.</p>

<p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Any dispute involving the use or retention of Personal
Information by Onvia shall be resolved by appeal to the American
Arbitration Association.</p>

<p><strong>Linked Sites</strong></p>

<p>For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Site
that link to other Web sites not under Onvia's control. We are not
responsible for and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the
privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to seek out and
read the privacy policy of any Web site that you visit. In
addition, when you initiate a transaction on a web site that our
Site links to, even if you reached that site through our Site, the
information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes
subject to the privacy practices of the owner of that linked site.
You should read their privacy policies to understand how they use
and protect personal information that they collect. Onvia is not
responsible for the privacy or information practices of its
suppliers or any third party web sites.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND CONSENT TO
THE PRIVACY PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF USE REFERENCED HEREIN.</p>
