  Recycler.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and 
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note this policy applies only to information collected by Recycler.com online 
and does not impact information collected or used by Recycler.com or its affiliates through other means.
</p>
 
   <p class="help_text">
  <b>How we gather information from users.</b>
   </p>
   <p class="help_text">
 How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate 
and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you 
to provide information, such as when you register to post a classified advertisement or request other features (e.g., 
newsletters and other products). You may also provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting 
and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.
   </p>

   <p class="help_text">
  Like most Web sites, recycler.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use "cookie" technology. 
Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each 
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. 
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to 
provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your 
ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password. 
Additionally we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.

</p>
 
   <p class="help_text">
     <b>What we do with the information we collect.</b>
   </p>
 
   <p class="help_text">
 We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) 
may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained 
from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may 
occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.
</p>

   <p class="help_text">
  We also collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. For example, we may 
use Personally Identifiable Information collected on recycler.com to communicate with you regarding 
our <a href="http://www.latimes.com/services/site/lat-terms,0,6713384.story">Terms of Service</a> and privacy policy, products 
and services offered by recycler.com and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners, administration of sweepstakes and 
contests, processing e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest. We reserve the right to share 
this information with other Tribune Company business units and affiliates, including for example our affiliated newspapers and 
entities in which Tribune Company has an ownership interest (collectively, "Affiliates"). This policy does not apply to any 
Affiliate's use of such information.
   </p>

   <p class="help_text">
  Personally Identifiable Information collected by recycler.com may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site 
administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting 
service and our newsletter provider, for example) may access such information.
   </p>

   <p class="help_text">
  As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, 
user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or 
whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide 
you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
   </p>
 
   <p class="help_text"><b>Your choice to opt out.</b></p>
                 <p class="help_text">   The quality classified advertisements and other information 
              on recycler.com is supported by advertising revenue and a controlled 
              program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online 
              publishing business. Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit 
              our advertising and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, 
              features, products, special offers and unique content we believe 
              might interest you. If you prefer not to receive e-mail communications 
              sent directly from our advertisers or promotional partners, you 
              will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us information 
              we might use for this purpose. If you decline at the time you provide 
              us such information, we will not share the Personally Identifiable 
              Information you provide with non-Affiliated advertisers for such 
              purposes, though we may on occasion send you information on their 
              behalf.   </p>
