    <h3 id="why_does">2. Why Does Recyclebank Collect Information About You and How Do We Use It?</h3>
    <p>Recyclebank uses the information described above to provide you with a superior member experience and, as necessary, to administer our business through the Recyclebank Rewards Program.&nbsp; For example, we collect various types of information that allow us to:<strong></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>reward Members in our Rewards Program for certain activities including recycling and other environmentally conscious activities (<em>e.g.</em> we may use household recycling data and PII to determine how many Recyclebank Reward Points you have earned, to alert you when you earn Reward Points and to fulfill reward requests);</li>
        <li>provide a more personalized online experience by using the images and screen names that you upload to the Site or select to identify you, both to yourself and to other participants (<em>e.g.</em> this may include us publicly displaying on our Site your photo and user name in connection with your profile and activities in the Recyclebank Reward Program); </li>
        <li>authenticate your identity; </li>
        <li>promote partners and vendors who support our various programs which comprise the Reward Program;</li>
        <li>conduct research and perform analysis in order to measure, maintain, protect, develop, and improve services to members (<em>e.g.</em> aggregate recycling and redemption data and other member actions from Recyclebank participants); </li>
        <li>administer sweepstakes, contests, promotions, or surveys; and </li>
        <li>communicate with you about special offers, events, new products or services, or surveys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="who_does">3. Who Does Recyclebank Share Your Information With and Why?</h3>
    <p>Recyclebank is not in the business of selling your information.&nbsp; We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.&nbsp; There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your PII with certain third parties with or without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
    <ol class="list-upper-alpha">
        <li><u>With your Consent</u>: We may share or disclose your PII or program activity with third parties with your express consent. Should an event arise which we deem appropriate to obtain your express consent, we will contact you directly using the contact information we have on file for you. It is important that you maintain all your information with us current and accurate.</li>
        <li><u>Law and Harm</u>: We may disclose your PII if we are required to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any of our Site users, any person or the general public; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Recyclebank's rights or property.</li>
        <li><u>Business Transfers</u>: If Recyclebank or all or substantially all of its assets are sold to a third party or parties, we may transfer Recyclebank members' PII and other information to those parties as part of the transaction. In the event of such a transaction, we will make sure that the acquiring entities are bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><u>Service Providers</u>: Recyclebank, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions (e.g. mailing campaigns to customers, maintaining databases, processing payments, and processing purchases). When we employ the services of another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function(s) and require that they in turn gain access only after agreeing to maintain this information in confidentiality and use it only for the limited purpose of providing the services contracted by Recyclebank.</li>
        <li><u>Advertisers</u>: We may provide aggregate anonymous information concerning member usage of our Site to third parties, such as in the case of advertisers, for purposes we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate regarding our Rewards Program.</li>
        <li><u>Recycling Programs/Non-Personal Aggregate Data</u>: In order to participate in any of our Recycling Programs, Recyclebank may record household recycling habits, redemption habits, and other information about you associated with our Recycling Programs. For example, we may record the frequency with which you recycle and the weight or volume of the materials you recycle. Occasionally in the United States, we may disclose individual level data corresponding to your address and location as well as aggregate recycling data to municipalities and haulers upon request if we determine this information will benefit the general public, promote further green actions within communities or if we are contractually obligated to do so as part of providing the Recycling Program in that community.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="how_can">4. How Can You Change Your Privacy Preferences or Account Information? </h3>
    <p>If, at any point during your membership with Recyclebank, you decide that you do not wish to receive specific program notices or messages, you can update your account profile and communication preferences at any time through the Site or by contacting Recyclebank's Customer Care Call Center as indicated below under “Contact Us”</p>

    <h3 id="what_info_is">5. <strong>What Information Is Collected Through Integration With Third Party Services?</strong></h3><strong>
    <ol class="list-upper-alpha">
        <li><u>Social Networking Sites: </u>One of the special features of this Site and the Recyclebank Rewards Programs is that we enable you to log in to your online profile with us via various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook and Twitter. &nbsp;By directly integrating our services with other online third party services, we make your online experience richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature we will ask you to log in to the relevant social networking service. When you add any social networking service to your Recyclebank online profile or log into this Site through your other social networking account(s), Recyclebank will collect relevant information necessary to enable this Site to access and collect your data contained within that particular social networking service (<em>e.g.</em> such as your Facebook profile information). Please remember however that the manner in which such third party social network provider uses, stores and discloses your information is governed solely by that provider's policies, and Recyclebank will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party site or provider that you may enable and link to your online experience with Recyclebank.</li>
        <li><u>Recyclebank Rewards Program Sponsors</u>: A key component of the Rewards Program is the member being able to earn and redeem Reward Points with featured sponsors. These featured sponsors are linked to our Rewards Program both outside and through our Site and integrated into member accounts to allow for maximum member ease in both earning and redeeming Rewards Points. This integration of featured sponsors does include Recyclebank making available certain aggregated member information which is anonymous as to any specific member. This allows Recyclebank to continue to incentivize members to engage in its Rewards Program while also maintaining individual member PII confidentiality.</li>
