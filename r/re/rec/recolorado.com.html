<p class="big" align="center"><b>Effective: May 18, 2005</b></p>

<p>At Metrolist, Inc, we are fully committed to the protection and security of any information you provide to us as visitors to our website.  We want you to know that we truly respect and will protect your privacy, so you can enjoy using our site in your search for properties in the Denver Colorado area.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy discloses our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used. Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.</p>

<p class="big"><b>What Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>Generally speaking, our website is informational. Your "personally identifiable information", that is, information about you as an individual which would permit someone to contact you, such as your email address, is only provided if you email us with questions or for any other reason.  Otherwise, we do not obtain any personally identifiable information about you through this site unless you voluntarily provide it.</p>

<p>As is the case when you visit most websites, to administer our site, your visit triggers the automatic logging of certain anonymous information about your computer system such as the type of browser you use, the server name and your "IP" (Internet Protocol) address.  When your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer using the Internet, it automatically gives that computer your computer's "address" so it knows where it should send the information. This is called your computer's "IP address."  This anonymous information does not contain any personally identifiable information about you.</p>

<p class="big"><b>How We Protect Your Information</b></p>

<p>We protect the confidentiality and security of any personal information you may provide us by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.</p>

<p>Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to this sensitive personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only.  Additionally, we use internal and external resources to frequently review the adequacy of our security procedures.  You need to know, however, that due to the open communication nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that communication between you and us, and between us and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties nor can we be responsible for information stolen from our servers by information harvesting software which may have the ability to scrape data.</p>

<p class="big"><b>We Do Not Sell Or Rent Any Information You Provide Us</b></p>

<p>If you provide personally identifiable information to us, please know we do not share your personal information with third parties for promotional use without your consent.  We feel it is important that you control what marketing information you receive.</p>

<p>We may, however, have to disclose, transfer, sell or assign any information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, to a third party as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Metrolist. We may also have to make information obtained through this website, or otherwise in our possession, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies when requested to do so or as required by law.</p>

<p class="big"><b>Cookie Technology</b></p>

<p>Cookie technology is employed, at your option, when you access our site.  The purpose of cookies is for us to track the uses of our site and are not "personally identifiable" information.  "Cookies" are small text files sent by Web servers to be stored on the computers of website users. These files often contain personalization settings or unique identifiers, to keep track of your information and to help us understand the movements of users within and between websites.</p>

<p class="big"><b>You Can Inquire About Your Information</b></p>

<p>You can contact us to inquire if we have any information about you by emailing Metrolist at <a href="mailto:privacy@metrolist.com">privacy@metrolist.com</a>.</p>

<p class="big"><b>Privacy Statement Changes</b></p>

Any new changes and/or amendments will be noted on our Home Page and will always be posted in this section of the Metrolist website.</p>
