      This privacy policy was last updated on 6/22/01.</i><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., the parent company of Ottaway 

      Newspaper Group, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as "Ottawa</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">y", 

      "we", "us" or "our", as applicable) are committed 

      to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us 

      when using their respective web sites (the "Ottaway Web Sites"). 

      This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received 

      about you when you visit the Ottaway Web Sites. <br>

      <br>

      <b>Information Collected<br>

      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web Site Usage Information: We automatically collects 

      IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit the 

      Ottaway Web Sites. This information helps us in evaluating how our visitors 

      use and navigate the Ottaway Web Sites on an aggregate basis, including 

      the number and frequency of visitors to each page of the Ottaway Web Sites, 

      and the length of their visits. <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Features: When you use some of the special features 

      of the Ottaway Web Sites and at other times, we may collect personally identifiable 

      information from you that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, 

      credit-card number and facts about your interests and similar information. 

      <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys and Form: We may conduct occasional online surveys 

      or ask you to fill in forms. For example, when you are within the Ottaway 

      Web Sites, you may see a pop-up window offering you the optional opportunity 

      of participating in a survey. These surveys and forms are entirely voluntary 

      and you may easily decline to participate.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children: We do not knowingly collect information from 

      children under the age of 13 although certain third party sites that we 

      link to may do so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and 

      privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 

      their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by 

      instructing their children to never provide information on the Ottaway Web 

      Sites without their permission.<br>

      <br>

      <b> How We Use Information Collected<br>

            </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 

            may use information that you provide us in the following ways: <br>

            - For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information, 

            for example, when you request that additional information be sent 

            to you, we will use your personal information to process your request. 

            <br>

            - To send you e-mail notifications about our new or existing services, 

            special offers, or to otherwise contact you. <br>

            - To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you 

            and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.<br>

            - To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and 

            services. <br>

            - To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information 

            about our user base and usage patterns. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may combine the information that we collect from 

            you on the Ottaway Web Sites with information that you provide to 

            us in connection with your use of our other products, services and 

            web sites. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use third party network advertisers to deliver 

            ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers 

            to contact you on our behalf, or facilitate some aspects of our services 

            or fulfill your requests. These network advertisers and service providers 

            may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable 

            information solely for the purpose of providing these services to 

            us or on our behalf. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may disclose and use personally identifiable 

            information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce 

            our Terms of Use (for example, when necessary to protect our intellectual 

            property rights) or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is 

            necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of 

            some or all of our assets in the Ottaway Web Sites. We may also disclose 

            personally identifiable information when we, in good faith, believe 

            that the law requires us to do so. As we develop our business, we 

            might sell or buy businesses or assets. In transactions such as these, 

            customer information is generally one of the transferred business 

            assets. Moreover, in the unlikely event that we or one of our publishing 

            lines are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred 

            assets.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, 

            we will not share your personally identifiable information outside 

            of Ottaway unless you "opt in" to having your personally 

            identifiable information shared with a company that is not affiliated 

            with us.<br>

            <br>

            <b>Your Ability to Choose<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can always decide not to provide your personal 

            information to the Ottaway Web Sites, however in some cases failing 

            to provide such information may limit your ability to use certain 

            or features available at the Ottaway Web Sites. You can let us know 

            that you do not wish to receive information about special offers and 

            new products and features by opting out at the time you give us your 

            personally identifiable information or after opting in by contacting 

            us at the following e-mail address: webmaster@th-record.com.<br>

            <br>

            <b> Cookies <br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use cookies to allow you to move quickly 

            through our site, to recognize repeat visitors and to allow you to 

            take advantage of some of our site's special features. A cookie is 

            a string of information that is sent by a Web site and stored on your 

            hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. Cookies are small 

            files (just a few hundred bytes) and should not pose any significant 

            disk-space concerns. When you visit the Ottaway Web Sites, or use 

            some of the features, like saving your personalized Ottaway Web Sites 

            settings, we may pass cookies to your computer. Some of the cookies 

            that we pass to your computer are long term. Otherwise, we would need 

            to ask you for certain information with each new session, such as 

            your login information. Some cookies do expire after a short period 

            of time.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other cookies that you will receive during your 

            sessions here are from third-party service providers or third party 

            network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies 

            in order to serve ads on the Ottaway Web Sites, ensuring that you 

            will not see the same ads over and over again. We are not responsible 

            for the cookies of such third parties or any use of your personal 

            information collected by such third parties.<br>

            <br>

            <b> Ottaway Web Sites Ads<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you view an ad for the Ottaway Web Sites 

            on other sites, our third party advertising company may place or recognize 

            a unique cookie on your browser. The Ottaway Web Sites and the advertising 

            company may also use invisible images (often referred to as pixel 

            tags, clear GIFs or web beacons) to note which Ottaway Web Sites pages 

            you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected 

            through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and 

            is used only to track responses to our advertising efforts.<br>

            <br>

            <b> Links to Third Party Web Sites<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may make third party content or services 

            from other web sites available to you from links located on the Ottaway 

            Web Sites. These other web sites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. 

            We recommend that you review the terms of use and privacy policy at 

            each such web site to determine how that site protects your privacy. 

            We are not responsible for the content of those web sites or the actions 

            of third party web site operators.<br>

            <br>

            <b> Security<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personally identifiable information we collect 

            about you is stored in limited access servers. We will maintain reasonable 

            safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally 

            identifiable information. <br>

            <br>

            <b>Review and Correction<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also request to review, change or delete 

            any of your personally identifiable information held by us by contacting 

            us at the following e-mail address: webmaster@th-record.com.<br>

            <br>

            <b> Exclusions <br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any submissions that you make to any public 

            areas of the Ottaway Web Sites including but not limited to, chat 

            services, bulletin boards, reviews, letters to the editor (collectively 

            "Public Areas") will be public and will not be subject to 

            this Privacy Policy. We do not control, and are not responsible for, 

            the actions of other users of the Ottaway Web Sites with respect to 

            any information you post in Public Areas. In addition, information 

            that you submit to Public Areas may be collected and used by us and 

            by others to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes. 

            <br>

            <br>

            <b> Policy Modifications<br>

            </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may change this Privacy Policy from time 

            to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. 

            <br>

            <br>
