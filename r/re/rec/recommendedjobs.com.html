<p>Recommended Jobs uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site. We strongly encourage you to exercise caution when providing information about yourself to others online, including when you apply for jobs found on Recommended Jobs.</p>

<p>Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer.
