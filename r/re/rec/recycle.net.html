<p><b>Cookies : </b>
We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is not uncommon for websites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users.

A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.

(ie. showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html"> click here</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.

This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>

Remember to sign out of your Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. 
</p>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your information, no web site or company, including ourselves, can absolutely ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 
</p>
<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy </h4>
