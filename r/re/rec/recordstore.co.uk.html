<p>If you shorten Universal Music Direct Limited URLs, for example on Twitter or Facebook, and use the <a href="https://manage.smarturl.it/mng/learn">smartURL</a> service to do so, Universal Music Direct Limited works with smartURL to rebrand some links, e.g. a <a href="http://kyl.ie/xxxx">http://kyl.ie/xxxx</a> link. Universal Music Direct Limited web products or phone apps sometimes offer features that allow users to share links with social networks and Universal Music Direct Limited shortens that URL using the smartURL service. Also Universal Music Direct Limited shortens links to online stores like the iTunes Music Store using the smartURL service.</p>
<p>smartURL provides Universal Music Direct Limited with anonymised, aggregated statistics relating to use of a shortened Universal Music Direct Limited URL, for example by telling us how many times it has been clicked on. Universal Music Direct Limited does not have access to the IP address of your computer collected by smartURL when you use its service or any other identifiable information about you. Nor does smartURL have any access to data collected on a Universal Music Direct Limited website.</p>

<ul>
<li>to collect anonymised data on users behaviour on the site. We may also capture what site a user has come from and what site they go to and also some demographic data (e.g. the user’s location) and we may use that data to analyse user behaviour across multiple sites; </li>
<li>to categorise pools of users (on an anonymised basis) based on demographic and/or behavioural data and use this to (1) target our advertising to cookie-ed users on third party sites and Universal Music sites (2) use that data to allow targeted third party advertising to categorised cookie-ed users either in respect of advertising placement <abbr title="Universal Music Group">UMG</abbr> has bought/placed and targeted to users on behalf of third parties  or in respect of advertising bought/placed by third parties and targeted to cookie pools <abbr title="Universal Music Group">UMG</abbr> has “sold” to these third parties.</li>
