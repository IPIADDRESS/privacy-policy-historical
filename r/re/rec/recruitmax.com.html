			<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			<div id="innercontent">
			
				<p class="sectionheader">
					Introduction
				</p>	
				<p>Vurv Technology takes privacy seriously.  In our modern technological world we work to balance the importance of the free flow of information against the importance of an individual's privacy rights. </p>
				
				
				<p>This Internet Privacy Policy describes the privacy policies applicable to Vurv Technology.</p>
				
				<p class="sectionheader">Website Data Collection Practices</p>
				<p>	Visitors to Vurv corporate websites are not asked to reveal any personally identifiable information. We collect information about visitors indirectly through standard web logs, including IP address, what browser is being used, and embedded 3rd party analysis (e.g. Google Analytics) from which a visitor entered the site.  Vurv normally uses this information in the aggregate to administer and improve our web site. While it is possible that some data may be traceable to an individual, we do not normally seek to identify individuals unless we believe that someone is using our site improperly.</p>
				
				<p class="sectionheader">Cookies</p>
				<p>Vurv leverages an Internet technology known as a "cookie" to store login and general information on visitors' computers. A cookie is a small amount of information that a web site transfers to a computer's hard drive. We use cookies to simplify visitors' access and to tailor our services to visitors' needs and interests.  For some services, we offer users the choice of having an ID or password stored in a cookie so that visitors do not need to re-enter it when they return to the site.  No other site can read a cookie set by Vurv, and we cannot read a cookie that another web site wrote to a visitor's computer.   Most Internet browsers are set to accept cookies. Users can reset browsers to refuse cookies and still use our web site, although access may be slower and less convenient.</p>	
						
				<p class="sectionheader">Use, Disclosure, &amp; Choice</p>
				<p>Vurv collects individually identifiable information from users who submit information on this site.  For example, if you submit a question to us online, we will collect your e-mail address.  If you apply for a job with Vurv, you will be asked to fill out an individual profile. Vurv collects individually identifiable information to maintain its applicant database and its subscription list, complete business transactions, fill and confirm orders for products and services, administer accounts, provide support, and update Vurv's databases.  Users may be contacted as necessary for these purposes. </p>	
				
				<p><strong>Opt-in Structure</strong><br>We ask each user to choose whether to receive promotional email updates about products and services offered by Vurv, and we will honor the choices made. </p>
				
				<p>Vurv relies on various service providers and other contractors to support its Internet sites and Vurv's business operations. Vurv shares information with contractors who directly support the services and who only use the information on our behalf in accordance with this policy. We also share information with auditors, lawyers or other contractors, but we require that recipients use the information only on our behalf for the purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the information when it is no longer needed.  These third parties' own privacy notices govern any information that they may collect on their own.  When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order or subpoena or when otherwise legally required. We may also disclose information as appropriate to protect our web site or legal rights, or in connection with a sale or merger involving the Vurv assets or businesses for which the information is maintained. </p>
				
				
				<p class="sectionheader">Confidentiality &amp; Security Safeguards</p>
				<p>Vurv takes technical, administrative and physical steps to protect against anticipated hazards such as unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information. Vurv employees who handle confidential, proprietary, or individually identifiable information must treat it confidentially and may not use it for purposes unrelated to Vurv's business or disclose it to unauthorized third parties.  Vurv employees are also responsible for the internal security of the information.  Employees who violate Vurv privacy policies and standards are subject to a range of disciplinary actions. </p>
				
				<p class="sectionheader">External Links</p>
				<p>This Site may include links to other websites whose privacy policies we do not control. Once you leave our servers (you can usually tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. </p>
					
					
				<p class="sectionheader">Access &amp; Correction</p>
				<p>Visitors and clients may contact Vurv Customer Service to see or change an Internet registration profile, unsubscribe from our newsletters, or to be removed from the Vurv database. </p>	
				
				<p class="sectionheader">Global Privacy Practices &amp; Storage of Information</p>
				<p>Web site user information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Vurv or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities.  By using this site you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>	
				
				<p class="sectionheader">Policy Updates</p>
				<p>This privacy policy was last updated on September 22, 2006.  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.  When we do so, changes in our privacy policy will be effective immediately.     If you are a regular visitor to this Site, we recommend that you check this privacy policy on a regular basis. </p>

				<p>Questions regarding this policy should be directed to Vurv at <a href="mailto:privacy@vurv.com">privacy@vurv.com</a> or by contacting us at:
