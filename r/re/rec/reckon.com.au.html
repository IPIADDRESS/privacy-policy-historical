<p><strong>Privacy Information Management Statement</strong><br>
  Reckon Limited  ("Quicken") publishes and distributes a range of personal and  business financial management software and provides technical support and  training services to software end-users. </p>
<p>We are required to comply  with the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988. </p>
<p>The privacy and security of  the personal information that we hold about you is very important to us. This  Statement is a requirement of the National Privacy Principles, and should  assist you in understanding how we collect and deal with your personal  information. </p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
  We most commonly collect  information from our customers in the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Upon  registration by you of any of the Quicken software range or services offered  through the <a href="http:///www.quicken.com.au" target="_blank">www.quicken.com.au</a> website or through retail and other sales channels. </li>
  <li>Upon  the purchasing of upgraded versions or renewal of subscription versions of  Quicken software, often in response to our having communicated with you about  such upgrades. </li>
  <li>Upon  the joining, or renewal, of various Quicken programs, including Quicken  Advantage or the Quicken Professional Partner program. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are other less  frequent instances where we collect personal information, such as when  financial details are sought from persons or businesses who seek to be Quicken  product resellers, where stock is provided on credit. </p>
<p>The information collected  would generally comprise name, address, postal address, telephone, fax and  e-mail contact details, as well as the details of the Quicken product that you  use. High level information in relation to your business may be also be  collected. Should you contact us requiring technical or similar assistance, information  relating to your problem and our suggested solutions are also recorded by us to  assist in better customer relationship management. </p>
<p>Personal information may  also be collected when customers sign up for add-on services provided by third  party suppliers such as debt recovery services, software training services,  share trading services, banking services, bill payments services and the like.  In these cases personal information may also be passed on to the third party  suppliers. </p>
<p>We also collect information  from delegates who attend our seminar series as well as other public events  where registration forms and feedback forms are filled out by attendees. The  information collected may be used to promote our products and services as well  as those of some of our network of associated service providers and product  vendors.</p>
<p><strong>How we use this information</strong><br>
  We use your personal  information in the following way: </p>
<ul>
  <li>We  collect personal information so that we can communicate with you about the  software product that you use and efficiently manage and administer all  products and services we provide to you. These communications could relate to  software upgrades, feature variations or enhancements, any particular issues or  problems that have been detected within the software and corrective measures  that may be taken, and informing you of other Quicken products and services,  including the availability of specialised, software specific, stationery  products, debt recovery services, software training services, share trading services,  banking services, seminars relating to associated products such as share  trading classes and other types of classes. </li>
  <li>Identification  and revalidation of software end-users assists Quicken in establishing who is  legally permitted to use the various Quicken software applications and  therefore assists us in enforcing copyright and intellectual property rights. </li>
  <li>In  the process of product installation a file on your hard drive records the date  of installation. This is not personal information but is a product number  unique to the computer on which the product is installed. This assists us to regularly  revalidate that the product is being used on the correct computer and is not  installed on other computers without your authority and outside the terms of  our licence.</li>
  <li>In  the case of Quicken Advantage, the additional questions we ask in relation to  your business assist us in developing a member profile so that future offerings  that may be developed for program participants are relevant and appropriately  targeted. As part of the Quicken Advantage service we also send correspondence to  Advantage members (including by e-mail) containing product and services related  information as well as promotional material.</li>
  <li>Aggregated  information (containing no information relating to a specific person) may  sometimes be used for research and analysis purposes by us or contracted  service providers for us to better understand statistical trends in industry  and product usage. </li>
  <li>In  the case of financial information requested from parties wishing to be  resellers and, as such, be provided with Quicken software stock on credit  terms, this information is used to perform credit referencing and checking. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you would prefer not to  receive communications from us that are not related to the bullet points above  please let us know by: <br>
  calling on 1300 QUICKEN  (1300 784 253), or <br>

  writing to The Privacy  Officer, Reckon Limited, Locked Bag 15, PO Broadway, NSW, 2007 </p>
<p><strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
  With the exception of the  final bullet point above (where the information is disclosed to a credit  referencing bureau), very little external disclosure of your personal  information is made by Quicken. In the event that an external party wishes to  communicate with any or all parts of the Quicken user/Advantage member  database, and Quicken is agreeable to this communication being sent, we would  generally undertake the communication on behalf of the external party (but at  their cost) so that access to the personal information of our customer remains  with Quicken. <br>
  Quicken may use, from time  to time, external service providers to facilitate communications with its  customers, for example a mail house. In these circumstances, Quicken may  provide personal contact/address information to the external service provider  to enable the communication to be dispatched. Such information is provided to  the external service provider on the strict basis that it be used for this  purpose only and agreements are put in place to ensure this. </p>

If you would like details of the personal  information which we may hold about you or, if you would like to correct any of  the information that we hold, please contact us as follows: </p>
