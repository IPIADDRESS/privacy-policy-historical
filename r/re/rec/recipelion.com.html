Under applicable law, we may share Other Information with other parties who already possess your Personal Information in order to enhance their records about you or enhance their ability to provide products and services.</li>
    </ul><p>For some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g., sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with certain content available on our websites.  Depending on where you reside, when you register for certain Services, we may share the Personal Information you provide with certain advertisers and sponsors.</p>
    <p>Some of the Services may include websites that Prime Publishing operates on behalf of third parties (<b>"Licensors"</b>).  Where applicable, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with the Licensor; however this privacy policy does not cover the user of your Personal Information by a Licensor.  The privacy practices of Prime Publishing's Licensors may differ from this policy and we encourage you to contact those third parties directly if you have questions regarding their use of your Personal Information.  When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Prime Publishing), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected information back to that partner, which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.</p>
    <p>With respect to surveys and quizzes, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey or quiz. Otherwise we will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users' responses in surveys or quizzes to other participants in the survey. Where surveys or quizzes allow users to submit written comments, and where Prime Publishing advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey or quiz, Prime Publishing reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.</p>
    <p>Prime Publishing and some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>
    <p>We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</p>
    <p>We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, including but not limited to monitoring fraud around the web.</p>
    <p>We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them. We may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier. Our partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system; (ii) combine User Information about you received from Prime Publishing with information about you from other sites or services; and (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>
    <p>If we engage a third-party Processor to Process your User Information, the Processor will be subject to binding contractual obligations to: (i) only Process the User Information in accordance with our prior written instructions; and (ii) use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the User Information; together with any additional requirements under applicable law.</p>

    <h5>Summary — International Transfers of Information</h5>
    <p><strong>We may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in other countries. Where we transfer User Information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to a recipient outside the EEA that is not in an adequate jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</strong></p>
    <p>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your User Information within the Prime Publishing group of companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 9 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your User Information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.</p>
    <p>Where we transfer your Personal Information from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in a jurisdiction that has been formally designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.  You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses using the contact details provided in Section 17 below.</p>
    <p>Please note that when you transfer any Personal Information directly to a Company entity established outside the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Information. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Information, from the point at which we receive the data, in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

However, we cannot guarantee there will not be a breach, and we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of any third parties.</p>

    <p>Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions. You can opt out or unsubscribe from a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.  If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>
    <p>Push Notifications. We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p>
    <p>Location Based Services. You may opt-out of having your Precise Location Data collected by Prime Publishing at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>
    <p>OBA. Prime Publishing strives to adhere to the self-regulatory organization principles for the DAA (US), the DAAC (Canada) and the EDAA (EU). Online ads on the Services using Online Data are delivered with the DAA Ad Marker Icon <img class="daa-ad-marker-icon" src="/images/DAA-Ad-Marker-Icon.png" alt="DAA Ad Marker Icon">, which helps users understand how their data is being used and provides choices for users who want more control.

If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;</li>
        <li>any sponsors of contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, or content offerings, the registration data for such events is to be used by us as part of User Information, and may be shared with the sponsor and others, subject to this Policy and the sponsor's privacy policy.  We may also share your information with third party vendors involved in the administration of such events. For contests, competitions, sweepstakes and prize draws, please read the official rules or terms and conditions carefully before you submit your information; and</li>
        <li>to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers).  Under applicable law, we may share Other Information with other parties who already possess your Personal Information in order to enhance their records about you or enhance their ability to provide products and services.</li>
    </ul><p>For some of our Services, we may make some information, such as the name of our users, their mailing address, phone number, email address—and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data—available on a rental or other basis (e.g., sale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with certain content available on our websites.  Depending on where you reside, when you register for certain Services, we may share the Personal Information you provide with certain advertisers and sponsors.</p>
    <p>Some of the Services may include websites that Prime Publishing operates on behalf of third parties (<b>"Licensors"</b>).  Where applicable, we may share some or all of your Personal Information with the Licensor; however this privacy policy does not cover the user of your Personal Information by a Licensor.  The privacy practices of Prime Publishing's Licensors may differ from this policy and we encourage you to contact those third parties directly if you have questions regarding their use of your Personal Information.  When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of Prime Publishing), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected information back to that partner, which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.</p>

Where surveys or quizzes allow users to submit written comments, and where Prime Publishing advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey or quiz, Prime Publishing reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.</p>
    <p>Prime Publishing and some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>
    <p>We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.</p>
    <p>We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, including but not limited to monitoring fraud around the web.</p>
    <p>We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them.

    <p><strong>We may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in other countries. Where we transfer User Information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to a recipient outside the EEA that is not in an adequate jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</strong></p>
    <p>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your User Information within the Prime Publishing group of companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 9 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your User Information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.</p>
    <p>Where we transfer your Personal Information from the EEA to recipients located outside the EEA who are not in a jurisdiction that has been formally designated by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Information, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.  You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses using the contact details provided in Section 17 below.</p>
    <p>Please note that when you transfer any Personal Information directly to a Company entity established outside the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Information.

    <p>Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions. You can opt out or unsubscribe from a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.  If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>
    <p>Push Notifications. We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running.

    <p>Location Based Services. You may opt-out of having your Precise Location Data collected by Prime Publishing at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>
    <p>OBA. Prime Publishing strives to adhere to the self-regulatory organization principles for the DAA (US), the DAAC (Canada) and the EDAA (EU).

For example, we may connect information about your IP address to known corporate or User Information and use the associated information related to aggregate content preferences to assist in our efforts to market services to you or the originating corporation(s).

    <p>Prime Publishing and/or certain third parties may collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (<b>"OBA"</b>) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.</p>
    <p>Prime Publishing displays ads on both the Services and on the Channels. We may use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.</p>
    <p><strong>The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change.</strong> Prime Publishing allows firms including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liveramp.com/">LiveRamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datonics.com/">Datonics</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magnetic.com/">Magnetic</a> to monitor Company web sites and newsletters for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisements, "click-throughs" and/or other activities. These firms may use cookies, web beacons and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about Company users.  Users may go to each firm's site/URL for information on what is being tracked. Users may go to each firm's site for information on how to opt-in or opt-out of use of their information and may go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> to opt-out of most third-party tracking.</p>

    <p>Online Data is aggregated with the Other Information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data and GeoIP Data, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using the Services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.

    <p>Some of the Services may include websites that Prime Publishing operates on behalf of third parties (<b>"Licensors"</b>).
