                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                    <p>Welcome to “RecordsBase.com”, a website designed to help you find information available in public records.  This privacy policy is for visitors (“you”) of the web pages at the domain www.recordsbase.com ("RecordsBase.com,” “services," or “the site”), which is owned and operated by Inflection.com, Inc. (“we” or “our”). </p>

                    <p>Archives, together with its parent company Ancestry.com Operations Inc., (“Archives”) provide all web pages at the domain members.recordsbase.com (“RecordsBase Members’ Website”).  Members will be using the Records Base Members’ Website regardless of whether they are using a free trial or a purchased membership with the RecordsBase Members’ Website.  For the Privacy Policy relating to the RecordsBase Members’ Website, <a href="http://members.recordsbase.com/member/privacy">click here</a>. </p>

                    <p>This policy discusses what information these sites collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances we may share it in. </p>

                    <h2>What is covered by this privacy policy?</h2>

                    <p>RecordsBase.com is a tool designed to help you find public records information about yourself and others.  This site is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Visit GoodHire.com for all your employment screening needs.</p>

                    <h2>What isn’t covered by this privacy policy?</h2>

                    <p>This privacy policy only applies to information collected while on the web pages at the domain www.recordsbase.com, which is owned and operated by Inflection. This policy does not apply to the practices of Archives, which interacts with users of the RecordsBase Members’ Website.</p>

                    <p>Further, this policy does not apply to the practices of other website domains you visit because you click a link on this site, to other Inflection services, to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.</p>

                    <h2>We Do Not Control The Public Records Made Available</h2>

                    <p>This site displays public records that are available in the real world, such as criminal history records from law enforcement agencies and bankruptcy records from courts. Original copies of public records can only be changed by those entities. </p>

                    <p>When users search for public records, Archives conducts the search. Inflection has no control over the records made available through the RecordsBase Members’ Website.</p>

                    <h2>Payments to Archives and Other Products</h2>
                    <p>If you choose to make a purchase or become a member of the RecordsBase Members’ Website, your purchase will be made through Archives and covered under its <a href="http://members.recordsbase.com/member/terms">terms</a>. </p>

                    <h2>Information We Collect From All Visitors</h2>

                    <h2>How We Use The Information We Collect</h2>

                    <p>Your information is only used to provide and market this service to you, which includes operating the website, conducting in-house research, preventing fraud or abuse, marketing you products or services offered by us, and communicating with you and addressing your concerns.</p>

                    <h2>We Only Share Your Information in the Following Situations</h2>

                    <p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information when you give us permission.</p>

                    <p><strong>With Our Parent Company:  </strong>Inflection.com, Inc. owns a variety of services in addition to this site, including Identity.com, PeopleSmart.com, GoodHire.com, and other people search sites. Data collected under this privacy policy is shared with Inflection and stored alongside data from those other services. Your choices on one service may affect another service.</p>

                    <p><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use certain trusted third parties to provide services for us. We only share the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the service. In addition, any third-party service provider we use is required to give your information the same protections that are outlined here in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Deidentified and Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share or disclose information we collect after deidentifying and aggregating it so it cannot be linked back to an individual person. We contractually require third parties to respect this practice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Inflection is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. However, the new entity will be bound by this privacy policy after the sale or transfer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legal Process and Emergency Circumstances:</strong> We may disclose or preserve for future disclosure your information if we believe, after due consideration, that doing so is reasonably necessary to protect Inflection’s rights or property or to comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process, or to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.</p>

                    <p>If you are a law enforcement officer seeking information from Inflection about one of our users, please reference our <a href="http://inflection.com/privacy/additional-privacy-resources/law-enforcement-guide">Law Enforcement Guidelines</a> for further information.</p>

                    <p>Unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will do our best to provide subjects of law enforcement requests with advance notice before we disclose their information to law enforcement, if we have contact information for that person. We reserve the right to withhold advance notice where it would impede an investigation of identity theft, or in situations involving imminent physical harm or harm to minors.</p>

                    <h2>How We Retain And Protect Your Information</h2>

                    <p>We retain all of the information we collect or that you submit for purposes including fraud prevention, legal compliance, and to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. </p>

                    <p>Your information is stored on secure servers in Northern California. While we use acceptable industry-standard practices to protect your information, we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will be absolutely secure.</p>

                    <h2>Fraud and Abuse Prevention</h2>

                    <p>We partner with certain third party vendors to prevent fraud and abuse. To do this, we may use information that includes your IP address, browser, and operating systems to identify suspected fraudulent activity and block it. </p>
