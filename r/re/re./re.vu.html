We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only.

Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.</p><p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p><p>Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p><p><strong>2) Referrals</strong></p><p>You may choose to invite friends to join the Bookcue, Inc. by sending invitation emails via our invite feature.
