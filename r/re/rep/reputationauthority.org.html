                        BorderWare Technologies, Inc. (“BorderWare”) is committed to protecting your privacy. The following policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our website users.
                        <br><br>
				Our goal is to collect, use and disclose only that information reasonably required to enable us to provide the particular product or service that you have requested, to maintain our customer/visitor lists and/or to respond to your inquiries or feedback. If you have provided us with contact information, we will maintain the confidentiality of your contact information and use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it, unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties (subject to the exclusions we have listed below). 
 			   </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                       <span class="faq_q1"><br>2. Acceptance of Terms </span> 
              	    By using BorderWare’s websites, you consent to the collection and use by BorderWare of Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
		         </p>

                        <p align="justify">
                        <span class="faq_q1"><br>3. Collection of Information</span><br>
                         Two types of information may be collected on BorderWare websites: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.   
                       </p>
   
                        <p align="justify">
 			   <br><span class="faq_q1">"Personal Information"</span> is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address and credit card information. At the time of collection we will set out clearly the information that we are collecting and the purposes for which we will use it. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you will not be able to use certain features of the websites and you will not be able to engage in transactions through the websites. The following is a list of the means by which BorderWare may collect Personal Information on this website: 
                       </p><ul style="margin: 10px 15px;"> 
                       <li> Communications from you; </li>
                       <li> Information downloads; </li>
                       <li> Customer support; </li>
                       <li> Registration of products; and</li> 
                       <li> Surveys. </li>
                        </ul>
			  <p></p>	
                       <p align="justify">
                         We also may receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information. 
		           <br><br> <span class="faq_q1">"Non-Personal Information"</span> is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the BorderWare website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, average time spent on websites, and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information, is also considered Non-Personal Information. Business contact information such as the name, title or business address of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
                         <br><br>Non-Personal Information may be collected or derived by us in the course of operating our websites. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie when you choose to visit BorderWare websites.
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1"> “Cookies” </span> may be used by BorderWare to track content usage and traffic on our websites. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a webpage server. BorderWare may use cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of our websites, such as how many users visit the websites, how long users spend viewing the websites, and what pages are viewed most often. This information may be used to improve the content of the websites. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies however, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the websites. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1"> 4. Use of Information</span><br>
				BorderWare collects information only for the following purposes: <br>
                     </p><ul style="margin: 10px 15px;"> 
				<li>To contact and correspond with you; </li>
				<li>To understand your needs and develop and recommend suitable products and services; 
				</li><li>To provide certain services; and </li>
				<li>To facilitate and enhance your use of the website. </li>
			</ul>	
			 <p></p>	
                       <p align="justify">
				Your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. Please be assured that we will not actively collect personally identifiable user information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell customer lists. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">5. Disclosure of Information</span><br>
				BorderWare will not transfer Personal Information to third parties, except for our business partners who have agreed to comply with legally required privacy standards, and who will use the information only for the purposes disclosed at the time of collection or for a use consistent with that purpose.
				<br>Such business partners may include: 				<br>
                 	    </p><ul style="margin: 10px 15px;"> 
				<li>Software developers; </li>
				<li>Hardware vendors; </li>
				<li>System integrators; and </li>
				<li>Distributors and resellers. </li>
			   </ul>	
			    <p></p>	
                         <p align="justify">
                         From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve our websites. These third parties may have limited access to databases of website user information or registered member information solely for the purpose of helping us to improve the websites and they will not be able to use the information about our users for any other purpose.
			    <br><br>We may disclose Personal Information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the terms of use for a new service.
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">Important Exceptions </span>
                         <br>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.
                         <br><br>We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">6. Outside Parties and Sites</span><br>
				Through BorderWare, you may be introduced to a variety of third party vendors and websites. The privacy policies of these third parties are not under our control and may differ from ours. The use of any information that you may provide to any third party, or the use of “cookie” technology by any third party, will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website that you are visiting. If you have any doubts about the privacy of the information you are providing on another website, we recommend that you contact that website directly for more information and review its privacy policy. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">7. Security</span>
                         <br>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your Personal Information is stored and maintained in a secure environment. BorderWare takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures to ensure that your Personal Information is only made available to such designated staff as necessary to carry out the stated purposes that we have communicated to you.
                         <br><br>You can help protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your password, and remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using BorderWare websites, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your Personal Information. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">8. Retention</span>
                         <br>BorderWare will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you.
                         <br><br>If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints. 
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">9. Amendment of this Policy</span>
                         <br>If we find it necessary or desirable to make major changes to our Privacy Policy in the future, we will post c. Any change to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change is posted and will apply to information collected from the date of the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and to existing information held by BorderWare. The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the top of this document. We recommend that you print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the BorderWare website signifies your acceptance of any changes.   
                         <br><br><span class="faq_q1">10. Access and Accuracy</span>
                         <br>You have the right to access your Personal Information to verify the Personal Information that we have collected in respect of you. Such requests should be submitted in writing.  Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your information. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will enable you to revise the Personal Information as appropriate. Having accurate Personal Information about you enables us to give you the best possible service.
                         <br><br>You can help by keeping us informed of any changes such as a change of address or telephone number. If you would like to access your information, or if you find any errors in our information about you, please contact us at:
