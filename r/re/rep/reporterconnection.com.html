We reserve the right to monitor your use of  this site. As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information may  be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the  information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web  beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs,  clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive  information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to  better understand how this site is being used.</p>
      <p class="rc2_text_normal_no-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A "cookie" is a text file  that this site sends to your browser in the form of a text file The information  generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address)  will be transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies,  but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; however,  certain features of this site might not work without cookies.</p>
      <p class="rc2_text_normal_no-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Session" cookies are  temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block  visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the site  "remembers" previous entries of country of origin that were outside  the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate  statistical information on the site. They are erased once you exit your Web  browser or otherwise turn off your computer. </p>
      <p class="rc2_text_normal_no-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Persistent" cookies are  more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your  computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store  information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving  certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what  areas of the site you may find most valuable, and customizing the site based on  your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this site in  your computer do not hold personal information.</p>
      <p class="rc2_text_normal_no-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can set your browser to accept all  cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered  so that you can decide each time whether to accept it.

The IP address can be used to diagnose problems  with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for  your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the  site. </p>
      <p class="rc2_text_normal_no-indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Internet tags" (also known  as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs)  tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type  related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online  advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the  site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information  is consulted. </p>
