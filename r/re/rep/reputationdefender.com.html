				<h4>Cookies</h4>

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
				
				<p class="four">We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

				<p class="four">We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to our website and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  </p>
				
				<p class="four">If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. You will be unable to log into our site if you reject cookies.  </p>
				
				<p class="four">Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on  <a href="http://www.reputation.com/" style="">www.reputation.com</a> and by Reputation.com Inc., only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.</p>

                <p class="four">We employ and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>
                
                <p class="four">We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

All personally identifiable information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to our production systems. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes. However, no security system is perfect. We do not guarantee or warrant that there will be no unauthorized access to your data. We will make all reasonable business efforts to protect your information, but no system can prevent all malicious attacks against our system or commonly used Internet protocols or software (eg, SSL). Please see our technical pages for more information about the security systems used.
