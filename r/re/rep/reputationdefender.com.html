If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us.</p>
			<!--<p>[If true at time of launch, include: Reputation Defender, Inc., is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.</p>
			<p>This privacy statement covers the site http://www.reputationdefender.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact us.

			<p><b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>
			<p>In some areas of our Web site, Reputation Defender, Inc., requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, username[s], credit card number, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible.  Reputation Defender, Inc., may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, behavioral, preferential, and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information.  If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p><b>OUR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
			<p>Except as provided below, the information collected by ReputationDefender is "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user.   ReputationDefender will not disclose any personally identifiable information about any individual without the individual's consent, except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. We are not limited in our use of non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc). </p>
			<p><b>Internal Uses</b></p>
			<p>We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. Due to the unpredictable nature of Internet routing, your information may pass through other countries while in transit to our servers.  We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, and 3) to improve our products and services. </p>
			<p>We give access to individually identifiable information about our users only to those employees who require it to fulfill customer service requests.</p>

			<p><b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b></p>
			<p>ReputationDefender will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. ReputationDefender will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission.  These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared. </p>
			<p>1.	We share information with companies that help us process the transactions you request and protect our customers' transactions from fraud.  Additionally, if you go into a negative balance and owe us money, we may share information with processing companies including collection agencies.</p>
			<p>2.	We disclose information that we in good faith believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our User Agreement. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.</p>
			<p>3.	We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.</p>
			<p>4.	When a user signs up for a co-branded version of ReputationDefender through links to ReputationDefender from our co-branded partner's website, ReputationDefender will share with the co-branded partner that user's name, e-mail address and physical address in order to provide enhanced integration between ReputationDefender's services and the services of our co-branded partner. If you do not want your information shared with ReputationDefender's co-branded partner, you should sign up with ReputationDefender directly and not through a link from our partner's website.</p>
			<p>5.	We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</p>
			<p>6.	We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users live in California. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
			<p>7.	We may use aggregated information to evaluate which products and services are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new services we should make available on our Websites.</p>
			<p>8.	As with any other business, it is possible that ReputationDefender in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by ReputationDefender, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.</p>
			<p>9.	We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety</p>
			<p>10.	The implementation of our Services, by its very nature, may require using your personally identifiable information to locate other information about you.  Such use may include, but not be limited to, using your information to search the publicly-accessible Internet sites as well as searching private information databases and sites.  </p>
			<p>11.	The implementation of our Services, by its very nature, may require revealing your personally identifiable information in order to effect removal of Internet content about you.  For example (but not limited to), we may have to disclose your name to a website in order to notify them to remove Internet content about you. </p>
			<p>12.	With your express permission for a given purpose.</p>
			
			<p><b>GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</b></p>
			
			<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
			<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. View this link for more information about cookies. The session ID cookies that we use on this site are encrypted, so that the information stored in the cookie can only be interpreted by ReputationDefender.  Session cookies may be required to be enabled for registering and logging in to this site.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.reputationdefender.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>
			
			<p><b>Information Security</b></p>
			<p>ReputationDefender is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security.  We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. All user profile information is contained behind a "firewall" and only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to our production systems. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to audit our security systems and processes.   However, no security system is perfect.  We do not guarantee or warrant that there will be no unauthorized access to your data.  We will make all reasonable business efforts to protect your information, but no system can prevent all malicious attacks against our system or commonly used Internet protocols or software (eg, SSL).  Please see our technical pages for more information about the security systems used.</p>
			<p>The security of your ReputationDefender account also relies on your protection of your ReputationDefender password. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password.  You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.  You may not share your ReputationDefender password with anyone. ReputationDefender will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the ReputationDefender website, which will always have a URL beginning with https://www.reputationdefender.com/ </p>
			<p>Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with https://www.reputationdefender.com/ should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to ReputationDefender immediately using the form located at <a href="contact.php">http://www.reputationdefender.com/contact.php</a>. If you do share your ReputationDefender password with a third party for any reason, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account at www.reputationdefender.com/ and changing your Profile settings.  If you believe that an unauthorized access has already occurred please report it immediately using the form located at <a href="contact.php">http://www.reputationdefender.com/contact.php</a>.</p>
			<p>ReptuationDefender may have access to your password and may use such password to access your account for debugging, quality assurance, or other internal purposes.</p>
			
			<p><b>Updating Information</b></p>
			<p>You may review, correct, update or change your ReputationDefender, Inc., account profile information at any time.  Simply log into your ReputationDefender account, go to your User Profile, review your account information and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided. If you are unable to edit your account information by logging into your account please contact us for assistance.</p>
			
			<p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
			<p>Our site may contain links to other Websites over which we have no control. ReputationDefender, Inc., is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Websites to which you choose to link from our website.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.  This Privacy Statement applies solely to the information we collect on ReputationDefender website, and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.</p>
			
			<p><b>Changes to Privacy Statement</b></p>
			<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.  You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Privacy Statement and related documents. No amendment to or modification of this Statement will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of ReptuationDefender or posted to the ReputationDefender website by a duly authorized representative of ReputationDefender.</p>
			
			<p>In the event Reputation Defender, Inc., goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Website for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personal information.  If, as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, they will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
