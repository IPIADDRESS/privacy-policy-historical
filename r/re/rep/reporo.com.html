    and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.</p>

    <p><b>1. The information we collect and how we use it</b><br>
    Thank 
    you for your interest in Reporo Limited</p>

    <p>In order to provide you with information about our products, services

    to use your personal information for purposes other than those described 
    above. </p>

    <p>We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes 
    of monitoring our services and web site usage in order to help us
