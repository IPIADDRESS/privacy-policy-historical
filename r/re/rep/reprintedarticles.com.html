                is stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read

                Helper.com you have visited or interacted with. Cookies can tell<br>

                people. This technology does not collect personal identifiable<br>
                information but is collected in a non-identifiable form. With<br>
                this information we learn about visitors browsing habits within<br>
                this site and we hope to improve our site with this technology.<br>

                Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name<br>
                and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet<br>
                Protocol" also known as the "IP address." When a visitor
                requests<br>
                a page from our web site, web servers automatically recognize<br>
                that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and
                IP<br>
                address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP<br>
                address from which you have accessed our site. We also use this<br>
                information to examine our traffic, but do not collect and<br>
                evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do
                not<br>
                record email addresses of the visitors unless you voluntarily<br>

                <b>Personally Identifiable Information<br>

                identifiable information, such as names, addresses, email<br>
                addresses and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a web<br>
                site visitor for the purposes of conducting a survey,<br>
                communications from visitor, or to provide additional services.<br>
                I.e. when subscribing to newsletters, contests, new products,
                web<br>
                site updates, referring this web site, general information, etc.<br>
                Whenever we request the identity of a visitor or customer, we<br>
                will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the<br>
                information is requested. The information is then used based
                upon<br>
                the description that was on the web page from which it was<br>
                obtained. I.e. when you enter a contest or other promotion, we<br>
                may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can<br>
                administer the contest and notify winners.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Any newsletter that you may have subscribed to, you will have
                the<br>
                opportunity to stop these announcements at any time by removing<br>
                your email address from the list by following the instructions<br>
                for removal that will be on the bottom of any such
                announcements.<br>
                We maintain a "No-Spam" policy once you are on one of our
                mailing<br>
                list which means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or<br>
                otherwise give your email address to a third party, without your<br>
                consent. In addition we will not send you email that you have
                not<br>
                agreed to receive once you are on one of our mailings. We may<br>
                from time to time send email announcing new products, services,<br>
                or promotions that we have added to this web site.<br>
                Prior to visiting this web site and signing up for one of our<br>
                newsletters, you may have received a solicitation from us by<br>
                means of some of our bulk email products. We market this web
                site<br>
                and merchandise based upon targeted lists for the products we
                are<br>
                advertising. With this type of marketing, we try to compensate<br>
                individuals for reviewing our advertisements with contests and<br>
                promotional items to compensate them for their time and trouble.<br>
                When we send you any bulk advertisement, you will always have
                the<br>
                opportunity to stop it at any time by removing your email
                address<br>
                from the list. Instructions for removal are located on the
                bottom<br>
                of any such announcements and we will comply with the existing<br>
                bulk emailing laws. It is beyond our control, however, if an<br>
                irate person causes to shut down our "remove" email address. We<br>
                will always be happy to add anyone to our remove list upon<br>
                request.<br>

                individuals may send their friends an email inviting them to<br>
                visit this web site. We have taken precautions to force people
                to<br>
                certify that the email addresses that are being submitted are of<br>
                friends or associates. If someone has considered you their<br>
                friend, and you received an email by mistake, then we apologize<br>
                for it. There may be some bad, or just plain stupid, people in<br>
                this world who may abuse our Refer this Site to a Friend, in<br>
                order to receive additional entries into our monthly contest. As<br>
                hard as we would try, there is no foolproof system. If you did<br>
                receive an email by mistake, please accept our apologies and if<br>
                you look through our web site, I'm sure you will find a FREE
                item<br>
                that will compensate you for the trouble that someone has caused<br>
                you. If this problem persists, contact us so we may help to<br>
                correct the problem.<br>

                need to know your personal information to include name, email<br>
                address, mailing address, shipping address, credit card number,<br>
                and expiration date, etc. This allows us to process and fulfill<br>
                your order and to notify you of your order status. We also use<br>
                this information to register your purchases for warrantees,<br>
                licenses, etc. In addition, we may use this information to
                notify<br>
                you of related products and services, but will not be shared or<br>
                sold to any third parties for any purpose. We use for ALL<br>

                a secure web site or a secure server. You will know when you are<br>
