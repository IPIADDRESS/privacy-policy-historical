       Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name<br>
       and a set of numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet<br>
       Protocol" also known as the "IP address." When a visitor requests<br>
       a page from our web site, web servers automatically recognize<br>
       that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP<br>
       address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP<br>
       address from which you have accessed our site. We also use this<br>
       information to examine our traffic, but do not collect and<br>
       evaluate this information for individuals. Our web servers do not<br>
       record email addresses of the visitors unless you voluntarily<br>
       provide that information to us.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
       <p><b><br>
       </b>Reprinted Articles.com may request and collect personally<br>
       identifiable information, such as names, addresses, email<br>
       addresses and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a web<br>
       site visitor for the purposes of conducting a survey,<br>
       communications from visitor, or to provide additional services.<br>
       I.e. when subscribing to newsletters, contests, new products, web<br>
       site updates, referring this web site, general information, etc.<br>
       Whenever we request the identity of a visitor or customer, we<br>
       will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the<br>
       information is requested. The information is then used based upon<br>
       the description that was on the web page from which it was<br>
       obtained. I.e. when you enter a contest or other promotion, we<br>
       may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can<br>
       administer the contest and notify winners.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Any newsletter that you may have subscribed to, you will have the<br>
       opportunity to stop these announcements at any time by removing<br>
       your email address from the list by following the instructions<br>
       for removal that will be on the bottom of any such announcements.<br>
       We maintain a "No-Spam" policy once you are on one of our mailing<br>
       list which means that we do not intend to sell, rent, or<br>
       otherwise give your email address to a third party, without your<br>
       consent. In addition we will not send you email that you have not<br>
       agreed to receive once you are on one of our mailings. We may<br>
       from time to time send email announcing new products, services,<br>
       or promotions that we have added to this web site.<br>
       Prior to visiting this web site and signing up for one of our<br>
       newsletters, you may have received a solicitation from us by<br>
       means of some of our bulk email products. We market this web site<br>
       and merchandise based upon targeted lists for the products we are<br>
       advertising. With this type of marketing, we try to compensate<br>
       individuals for reviewing our advertisements with contests and<br>
       promotional items to compensate them for their time and trouble.<br>
       When we send you any bulk advertisement, you will always have the<br>
       opportunity to stop it at any time by removing your email address<br>
       from the list. Instructions for removal are located on the bottom<br>
       of any such announcements and we will comply with the existing<br>
       bulk emailing laws. It is beyond our control, however, if an<br>
       irate person causes to shut down our "remove" email address. We<br>
       will always be happy to add anyone to our remove list upon<br>
       request.<br>

       <b>Viral Marketing Mistake</b></p>
       <p><b><br>
       </b>We use viral marketing and contests on this web site in which<br>
       individuals may send their friends an email inviting them to<br>
       visit this web site. We have taken precautions to force people to<br>
       certify that the email addresses that are being submitted are of<br>
       friends or associates. If someone has considered you their<br>
       friend, and you received an email by mistake, then we apologize<br>
       for it. There may be some bad, or just plain stupid, people in<br>
       this world who may abuse our Refer this Site to a Friend, in<br>
       order to receive additional entries into our monthly contest. As<br>
       hard as we would try, there is no foolproof system. If you did<br>
       receive an email by mistake, please accept our apologies and if<br>
       you look through our web site, I'm sure you will find a FREE item<br>
       that will compensate you for the trouble that someone has caused<br>
       you. If this problem persists, contact us so we may help to<br>
       correct the problem.<br>

       this information to register your purchases for warrantees,<br>
       licenses, etc. In addition, we may use this information to notify<br>
       you of related products and services, but will not be shared or<br>
       sold to any third parties for any purpose. We use for ALL<br>
       purchases a shopping cart feature that safeguards this<br>
       information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer)<br>
       encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between<br>
       you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to<br>
       intercept the information. This type of technology is also called<br>
       a secure web site or a secure server. You will know when you are<br>
       on a secure web site when the front of the web address has<br>
       "https" instead of the normal "http".<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       If we ask for your postal address in an online form on our site,<br>
       it will only be because it is required based upon a purchase or<br>
       the registering of a product that you have purchased. You will<br>
       never receive any advertisements from us by US. Mail.<br>
