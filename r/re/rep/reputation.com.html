            <ol type="a">
                <li>We share information with service providers under contract who help with our business operations such as payment and order processing, fraud investigation, bill collection, and information management and analytics.  If content generation is included in your services, we may share information with service providers under contract to create, edit and/or publish such content.

                <li>We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use.  For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information (but not bank account or credit card information) to victims who request it.</li>
                <li>We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified subscriber or limited group of subscribers, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the subscriber(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We can't guarantee that we'll be able to in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a subscriber, or for any other reason.</li>
                <li>When a user signs up for a co-branded version of our service through links to Reputation.com from our co-branded partner's website, Reputation.com, Inc., will share with the co-branded partner that user's name, e-mail address and physical address in order to provide enhanced integration between Reputation.com's services and the services of our co-branded partner. If you do not want your information shared with Reputation.com Inc.'s co-branded partner, you should sign up for Reputation.com directly through <a href="https://www.reputation.com">www.reputation.com</a> and other sub-domains and not through a link from our partner's website.</li>
                <li>We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</li>
                <li>We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us.  Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, services and advertising.  It will not be shared with third parties for <i>their</i> marketing purposes. These third parties are contractually obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</li>
                <li>As with any other business, it is possible that Reputation.com, Inc. in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Reputation.com, Inc., including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.</li>
                <li>We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.</li>
                <li>The implementation of our Services, by its very nature, may require using your personally identifiable information to locate other information about you. Such use may include, but not be limited to, using your information to search the publicly accessible Internet sites as well as searching private information databases and sites.</li>
                <li>The implementation of our Services, by its very nature, may require revealing your personally identifiable information in order to effect removal of Internet content about you. For example (but not limited to), we may have to disclose your name to a website in order to notify them to remove Internet content about you.  This occurs with your express permission for a specific, given purpose.</li>
            </ol>

Such information is maintained securely using industry standard safeguards.</p>

        <a id="p5"><h3>5. INFORMATION SECURITY</h3></a>

        <p class="three">3. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to test our security systems and processes.  However, no security system is perfect.  We do not guarantee or warrant that there will be no unauthorized access to your data.</p>
        <p class="three">4. We will make all reasonable business efforts to protect your information, but no system can prevent all malicious attacks against our system or commonly used Internet protocols or software (e.g., SSL).  Please see our technical pages for more information about the security systems used.</p>

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password.  You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.  You should not share your Reputation.com password with anyone.</p>

        <p class="three">1. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on the Site.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site.</p>
        <p class="three">2. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site.  Specifically, we use session cookies to track your session ID and to track whether or not you are logged into the Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Click <a href="http://www.proxyway.com/www/delete-computer-cookies.html">here</a> for more information on how to remove persistent cookies.</p>
        <p class="three">3. We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site.</p>
        <p class="three">4. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. You will be unable to log into the Site if you reject cookies.</p>
        <p class="three">5. Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on their sites.  We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on <a href="https://www.reputation.com">www.reputation.com</a> and by Reputation.com Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.</p>
        <p class="three">6. We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p class="three">7. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the <a href="#p8">“Choice and Opt-out"</a> section below.</p>

        <a id="p7"><h3>7. LINKED SITES</h3></a>
        <p class="three">The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Reputation.com, Inc.  Please be aware that we, Reputation.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by the Site.</p>

        <a id="p8"><h3>8. CHOICE AND OPT-OUT</h3></a>
        <p class="three">1. We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.  For example, if you purchase a product/service, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in the Site's account area.</p>
        <p class="three">2. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@reputation.com">helpdesk@reputation.com</a>. We also offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on the Site, via our user account area.</p>

        <a id="p9"><h3>9. CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT</h3></a>
        <p class="three">1. If we decide to make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by e-mail through the primary e-mail address specified in your account and/or post those changes to this privacy statement on the Website homepage, prior to the changes taking effect.  You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you.</p>
        <p class="three">2. You are also responsible for regularly reviewing the Privacy Statement and related documents.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time.   No amendment to or modification of this Statement will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Reputation.com, or posted to the Site by a duly authorized representative of Reputation.com.</p>
        <p class="three">3. In the event Reputation.com., goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of a portion of its assets, users' personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  Users will be notified via prominent notice on the Site for 30 days after a change of ownership or control of their personally identifiable information.  If, as a result of the business transition, a users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
        <p class="three">4. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of Reputation.com, Inc., with respect to personal information, or your dealings with the Site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:info@reputation.com">info@reputation.com</a> or write to:</p>
