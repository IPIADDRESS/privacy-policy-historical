Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with

We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site.</p><p>2. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. Specifically, we use session cookies to track your session ID and to track whether or not you are logged into the Site.

We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site.</p><p>4.

<a href="https://www.reputation.com">www.reputation.com</a> and by Reputation.com Inc. only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.</p><p>6. We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p><p>7. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the
<a href="#p8">"Choice and Opt-out"</a> section below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>
<a id="p7">7. LINKED SITES</a></h3><p>The Site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Reputation.com, Inc.

<a id="p9">9. CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT</a></h3><p>1. If we decide to make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by e-mail through the primary e-mail address specified in your account and/or post those changes to this privacy statement on the Website homepage, prior to the changes taking effect.

No amendment to or modification of this Statement will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Reputation.com, or posted to the Site by a duly authorized representative of Reputation.com.</p><p>3. In the event Reputation.com., goes through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of a portion of its assets, users' personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
