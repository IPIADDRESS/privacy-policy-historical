<p>6. Reputation.com will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the Site, which will always have a URL beginning with <a href="https://www.reputation.com">https://www.reputation.com</a>. If you receive an email that asks you for your log in information or password, <i>it is not from us and you should not respond.</i></p>
<p>7. Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with <a href="https://www.reputation.com">https://www.reputation.com</a> should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to Reputation.com, Inc., immediately by emailing <a href="mailto:helpdesk@reputation.com">helpdesk@reputation.com</a>.</p>

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

<p>3. We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site.</p>
<p>4. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. You will be unable to log into the Site if you reject cookies.</p>

<p>6. We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>7. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the <a href="#p8">"Choice and Opt-out"</a> section below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="p9">9. CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT</a></h3>

      <h5>What is online reputation management?</h5>
      <p>In a nutshell, online reputation management, or ORM as it's known, is the practice of making people and businesses look their best on the Internet. To accomplish that, people need to control their online search results because they frequently contain inaccurate, misleading, or outdated material which can adversely influence how web searchers view them.</p>
