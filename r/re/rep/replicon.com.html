        information in its custody or control in accordance with privacy legislation applicable
        to Replicon. This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Alberta's
        <i>Personal Information Protection Act</i> ("PIPA"). However, in certain circumstances,
        other legislation may be applicable.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Application</b></p>
    <p>
        This Policy describes and summarizes the practices of Replicon and its affiliates
        with respect to our collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information related
        to all individuals other than employees and individual contractors of Replicon;
        those individuals are subject to a separate policy. Employees of Replicon dealing
        with personal information are expected to be familiar with this Policy.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Definitions</b></p>
    <p>
        In this Policy, the following terms have the meanings below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Personal information</b> means information about an identifiable individual,
            which does not include information of an aggregate or anonymous nature where a specific
            individual or individuals cannot be identified. Personal Information also does not
            include <b>business contact information</b>, as long as business contact information
            is used to contact an individual in their capacity as an employee or official of
            an organization, and for no other purpose. Information about a corporation, firm,
            trust, union or other non-individual entity is not personal information.</li>

        fields and to remember user preference. This is done for user convenience as well
        as to provide us with information on which parts of our website are being viewed
        and by how many visitors. The tracking process is anonymous and no personal information
        is used.</p>
    <p>
        <b>E-mail</b></p>
    <p>
        If you voluntarily submit personal information to us by e-mail for purposes of obtaining
        information, we will consider that you have done so with your consent for purposes
        reasonably related to your providing the information. If reasonable to do so, after
        our initial response, we may send further information to you with information that
        may be useful, but we will include instructions on how to terminate receiving such
        further information. Please be advised that the Internet and e-mail are inherently
        insecure media, and we cannot take responsibility for the security or privacy of
        personal information in transit over the Internet.</p>

        Please note that our website may contain links to other websites which are provided
        as a convenience for visitors to our website only. Any third party websites will
        have their own privacy policies and practices, and we cannot be responsible for

            information to Replicon;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the collection of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation
            or a legal proceeding;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the information is publicly available;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
            owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to an individual money owed by Replicon.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition to the above, the law generally provides that an individual is deemed
        to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about that
        individual for a particular purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the information
        for that purpose, and it is reasonable that a person would voluntarily provide that
        information. If an individual provides personal information to us voluntarily, we
        will rely on deemed consent and consider that the individual consents to our collection,
        use or disclosure of their personal information as necessary to carry out the purposes
        for which they provided the information.</p>
    <p>
        Where a new purpose for the use or disclosure of personal information previously
        collected arises, Replicon will contact the individual in question to obtain any
        required consent or to provide any required notification for use and/or disclosure
        for such new purpose or purposes.</p>
    <p>
        Where practical, Replicon will try to collect personal information directly from
        the individual. Where necessary, Replicon will collect personal information from
        other sources. When Replicon collects personal information about individuals directly
        from them, except when their consent to the collection is deemed or has otherwise
        been previously and lawfully obtained, or is not required, we will tell them the
        purpose for which the information is collected, and, if reasonable to do so, the
        name of a person who can answer questions about the collection.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Why we collect, use and disclose personal information</b></p>

        </p>
        <li>Shareholders and investors: To manage our relationship with and our obligations
            to investors and shareholders. Replicon is required by applicable laws and regulatory

            to its shareholders.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Directors and officers: To manage our relationship with and our obligations to directors
            and officers. Replicon is required by applicable laws and regulatory authorities

            its directors and officers.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Other individuals: Personal information from other individuals may be collected,
            used or disclosed when such individuals contact Replicon for a variety of reasons
            personal to them. For example, if an individual contacts us with an inquiry, we
            will use the information provided to assist us in responding to that individual
            and communicating with them. Generally, such information is used to contact or reply
            to individuals who have contacted us where such contact or reply is reasonable in
            the circumstances, or is subject to deemed consent, or is legally required.</li>

        </p>
        <li>Telephone Conversations: Please refer to the more comprehensive section on telephone
            conversations in this Policy.</li>

        </p>
        <li>To fulfill our legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>
    <p>
        As with collection, there are exceptions to the requirement of consent with respect
        to use. For example, Replicon may use personal information without consent in circumstances
        that include but are not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where a reasonable person would consider that the use of the information is clearly
            in the interests of the individual and consent of the individual cannot be obtained
            in a timely way or the individual would not reasonably be expected to withhold consent;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the use of the information is pursuant to a statute or regulation of Alberta
            or Canada that authorizes or requires the use;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the information in question was collected is from a public body and that public
            body is authorized or required by an enactment of Alberta or Canada to disclose
            the personal information to Replicon;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the use of the information is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation
            or a legal proceeding;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the information is publicly available;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where the collection of the information is necessary in order to collect a debt
            owed to Replicon or for Replicon to repay to the individual money owed by Replicon;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>In certain circumstances, where the information may be disclosed without consent,
            it may also be used without consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Replicon will in all cases use personal information as permitted or required by
        applicable law.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Disclosure of personal information</b></p>
    <p>
        It is the general policy of Replicon to not disclose personal information in its
        custody or control except with the consent of the individual and then only for identified
        purposes. However, individuals should be aware that there are exceptions to the
        above.</p>
    <p>
        Alberta law permits us to collect, use or disclose personal information about an
        individual in some circumstances without the individual's consent and/or knowledge.
        Such circumstances include (but are not limited) to where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the collection, use or disclosure is clearly in the interests of the individual
            and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>collection, use, or disclosure is reasonable for the purposes of an investigation
            or proceeding;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the personal information is available to the public from a prescribed source; or</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the collection, use, or disclosure is required or authorized by a statute or regulation
            of Alberta or Canada.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Replicon will in all cases disclose personal information as required or permitted
        by applicable law.</p>
    <p>
        Replicon does not disclose, trade or sell its customer or contact lists.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Telephone Calls</b></p>
    <p>
        All incoming and outgoing telephone calls using Replicon's telephone systems are
        subject to automated recording and archiving. Recording is a function of certain
        technology and cannot be turned off by individual Replicon employees or contractors
        for particular cases. Recording is carried out for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To ensure accuracy of communication. This includes ensuring accuracy of our understanding
            of customer requirements, orders and agreements made with customers, and, if necessary,
            to accurately document such agreements in the event of a misunderstanding or dispute
            to protect both Replicon and the customer;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>To ensure quality of service provided by Replicon representatives.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Recordings of telephone calls are initially not reviewed or overheard in any manner,
        but are archived in digital format on a secure server without review. Such recordings
        may be subsequently reviewed by Replicon at any time for any one or more of the
        stated purposes and, in particular, may be used without notification or consent
        as evidence in the event of an investigation or legal proceeding related to such
        telephone conversation, or to review the quality of service provided in situations
        where Replicon has a basis to believe that such quality may not be adequate and
        generally only with respect to those Replicon representatives who interact with
        customers.</p>
    <p>
        Callers from outside Replicon are advised that their call may be recorded and potentially
        used on the foregoing basis by posting a notice to that effect on Replicon's web
        site. Callers have the option at their request of opting out of such recording by
        asking their Replicon representative to call them back on a cell phone, which is
        not subject to automated recording. Individuals may also communicate with Replicon
        via e-mail, fax or mail.</p>
    <p>
        Recordings, including recordings that are not reviewed, are retained on the same
        basis as other personal information pursuant to this Policy. Where required or permitted
        by law, Replicon may use or disclose personal information contained in recordings.
        Replicon does not use information contained in recordings for marketing or solicitation
        purposes. Access to such recordings is restricted to particular individuals within
        Replicon who have obligations of confidentiality to Replicon and who have a need
        to review such recordings as part of their obligations to Replicon.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Computer Interaction</b></p>
    <p>
        There are occasions where Replicon representatives may remotely access a computer
        of a Replicon customer in order to provide services, including technical support
        or product support. Such access may include an exchange of information of a conversational
        nature and, while not intended to do so, such access may result in the collection
        of personal information incidental to our providing services. The activities carried
        out during such access are recorded and archived so that the recording of such activities
        may later be viewed or reviewed for the purposes of providing services to the customer
        in question. The recording is a video file without sound and is subsequently used
        only for the purposes of assisting the customer. In all cases where a computer becomes
        subject to access by Replicon, such access will be with the customer's knowledge
        and consent.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Retention and destruction of personal information</b></p>
    <p>
        Alberta law allows us, for legal or business purposes, to retain personal information
        for as long as is reasonable. Upon expiry of an appropriate retention period, bearing
        in mind reasonable legal and business requirements, personal information will either
        be destroyed in a secure manner or made anonymous.</p>
    <p>
        Should consent to our collection, use, disclosure or retention of personal information
        be revoked by the individual in question, the law also allows us to continue to
        retain the information for as long as is reasonable for legal or business purposes.
        In the event that revocation of consent may have consequences to the individual
        concerned, we will advise the individual of the consequences of revoking their consent
        where it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so.</p>
    <p>
        When we collect, use or disclose personal information, we will make reasonable efforts
        to ensure that it is accurate, up to date, and complete.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Security</b></p>
    <p>
        We recognize our legal obligations to protect the personal information we have gathered
        about individuals. We have therefore made arrangements to secure against unauthorized
        access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction
        of personal information. These arrangements may include physical security measures,
        network security measures, and organizational measures such as non-disclosure agreements
        and need-to-know access.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Requests for Access</b></p>
    <p>
        Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to provide them
        with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>access to their personal information under the custody or control of Replicon;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>information about the purposes for which their personal information under the custody
            or control of Replicon has been and is being used; and</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the names of organizations or persons to whom and the circumstances in which personal
            information has been and is being disclosed by Replicon.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Requests for access are subject to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any requests must be in writing.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>We do not accept such requests or respond to such requests via e-mail.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual must provide us
            with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and to respond to them.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>We will respond to requests in the time allowed by Alberta law, which is generally
            45 days. In certain circumstances, we may have a right to extend this period of
            time and will advise in writing if we are doing so.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>We will make a reasonable effort to assist applicants and to respond as accurately
            and completely as reasonably possible.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>All requests may be subject to any fees and disbursements the law permits us to
            charge.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>Where appropriate to do so, we may require advance payment of a deposit or the entire
            costs of responding to a request for access to personal information.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that an individual's ability to access his or her personal information
        under our control is not an absolute right. Alberta law provides that Replicon must
        not disclose personal information where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the disclosure could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety or physical or
            mental health of an individual other than the individual who made the request;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual; or</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the disclosure would reveal the identity of an individual who has in confidence
            provided us with an opinion about another individual and the individual providing
            the opinion does not consent to the disclosure of his or her identity.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Alberta law also provides that Replicon may choose not to disclose personal information
        where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the personal information is protected by any legal privilege;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information
            and it is not unreasonable to withhold that information;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the personal information was collected by Replicon for an investigation or legal
            proceeding;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the disclosure of the personal information might result in similar information no
            longer being provided to us when it is reasonable that it would be provided;</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>the personal information was collected or created by a mediator or arbitrator in
            the conduct of a mediation or arbitration for which he or she was appointed to act</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>under an agreement,</li>
            <p>
            </p>
            <li>under an enactment, or</li>
            <p>
            </p>
            <li>by a court; or</li>
            <p>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <li>the personal information relates to and may be used in the exercise of prosecutorial
            discretion.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Replicon reserves all its rights under the above.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Responses to Requests</b></p>
    <p>
        Our responses to requests for access to personal information will be in writing,
        and will confirm:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>whether we are providing all or part of the requested information,</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>whether or not we are allowing access or providing copies, and,</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>if access is being provided, when and how that will be given.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If access to information or copies are refused by us, we will provide written reasons
        for such refusal and the section of PIPA (the Personal Information Protection Act,
        Alberta) on which that refusal is based. We will also provide the name of an individual
        at Replicon who can answer questions about the refusal, and particulars of how the
        requesting individual can ask the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta
        to review our decision. In order to receive a response to such a request, the individual
        must provide us with sufficient information to locate their record, if any, and
        to respond to them.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Requests for Correction</b></p>
    <p>
        Alberta law permits individuals to submit written requests to us to correct errors
        or omissions in their personal information that is in our custody or control. If
        an individual alleges errors or omissions in the personal information in our custody
        or control, we will either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>correct the personal information and, if reasonable to do so, and if not contrary
            to law, send correction notifications to any other organizations to whom we disclosed
            the incorrect information; or</li>
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>decide not to correct the personal information but annotate the personal information
            that a correction was requested but not made.</li>
        <p>
        </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Corrections or amendments will not made to opinions as opposed to factual information,
        although we reserve the right to modify opinions where changes in the facts on which
        those opinions are based occur.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Amendment</b></p>
    <p>
        Replicon may amend this Policy from time to time as required and without notice,
        in order to better meet our obligations under the law.</p>
    <p>
