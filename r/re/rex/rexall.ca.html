    <h2 id="privacy-home">REXALL PHARMACY GROUP LTD PRIVACY STATEMENT</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>LAST UPDATE:</strong>
        August 12, 2016
    </p>
    <p>
        Rexall Pharmacy Group Ltd. (“<strong>Rexall</strong>”) and its banner pharmacies, including Pharma Plus, Rexall™ and Rexall™ Pharma Plus respect the privacy rights of our customers and employees and are committed to protecting the personal information that we collect from you. We have adopted this Privacy Statement to guide how we collect, use and disclose the information you provide to us. Specifically, this Privacy Statement has been developed so that you can learn more about the policies and practices that we have developed to safeguard personal information, and to better understand our relationships with the third parties who may have access to this information.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Statement applies to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of all commercial dealings with Rexall, including
        pharmacy and retail services and applies to the use of any website or mobile application maintained by Rexall, affiliates of which are operators of retail
        pharmacies in Canada. Websites include the Rexall.ca website,the MediTrust.ca website and Rexall Pharma Plus MyRexall Account Website (the	<strong>“Sites</strong>”), and the Rexall Pharma Plus Mobile Application, and the Rexall Pharma Plus MyRexall Account Software Application for Mobile
        Devices (the “<strong>Applications</strong>”), and any other websites and applications that may be developed in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of this Privacy Statement, unless stated otherwise, all references to “Rexall” or “we” include Rexall Pharmacy Group Ltd.., as well as its
        affiliates and subsidiaries that are operators of retail pharmacies in Canada (and that provide pharmacy services to the MediTrust home delivery program).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Personal Information</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, for example, their name, date of birth and email address. Personal information also
        encompasses personal health information, such as your medical records and other information about your health and your prescriptions, that has been
        collected or generated by your pharmacist.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Consent</u></strong>
        <u></u>
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that we may collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rexall will collect, use and disclose personal information without your consent only in limited circumstances as permitted by law. There have
        always been, and may continue to be, instances where we may collect, use and disclose your personal information without your consent. These instances are
        permitted under privacy legislation in order to ensure that the consent requirement is not a hindrance to your health and safety. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        - personal information may be collected without consent where the collection is clearly in the interest of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in
        a timely way;
        <br>
        <br>
        - personal information may be used without consent where it is used for the purpose of acting in respect to an emergency that threatens the life, health or
        security of an individual; and
        <br>
        <br>
        - personal information may be disclosed without consent where the disclosure is made to a person who needs the information because of an emergency that
        threatens the life, health or security of an individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than described directly above, we will not collect, use or disclose your personal information for new purposes, unrelated to the purposes described
        in this Privacy Statement, without first obtaining your prior consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to later withdraw your consent to allow us to collect your personal information, we will still be obliged to comply with all the provincial
        laws that require us to keep records relating to the medication that we dispense to you. If you chose to not give us consent to disclose certain personal
        information, we may not be able to provide you with the full range of pharmacy services. For example, if you indicate to the pharmacy staff that you do not
        consent to communications with your insurance company, you may be required to pay for your prescription and send the information required for reimbursement
        directly to your pharmacy benefits plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Information We Collect </u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Rexall collects personal information for various purposes, including to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>provide healthcare related services;</li>
        <li>process payments;</li>
        <li>communicate with individuals involved in your care or the payment of your care;</li>
        <li>provide health-related education communications;</li>
        <li>communicate products and services;</li>
        <li>provide loyalty programs, contests, promotions and other non-pharmacy related activities; and</li>
        <li>manage the business</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Rexall will inform you, when requested, as to why we must collect any of your personal information before the information is collected.<strong></strong>

        When you first visit one of our banner pharmacies, your personal information will be collected in order to establish your record. Types of information we
        collect include (but is not limited to), prescription information (e.g. patient, medication and prescriber information), health information (e.g. allergies
        and medical conditions) and insurance information. Upon request, the pharmacist or one of their pharmacy staff will provide you with information on why
        your personal information is required and to whom they must disclose it in order to provide you with pharmacy services.
        <br>
        There may be times when you want us to share prescription-related information with a family member or authorized representative or, alternatively, to
        specifically restrict with whom we may share the information. We will comply with your request upon notification by you. For example, if you would like to
        have special provisions made for the pick-up or delivery of your prescription, we will follow your instructions upon your request. We will maintain a
        record of your instructions. Simply contact your pharmacy and they will be pleased to update this information.

        <strong>(ii) Information We Collect Online</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        With respect to the Sites and Applications, in addition to the personal information that you provide to us with your account registration and the personal
        information that has already been collected by your pharmacist, we have access to the following categories of information regarding you and your visit to
        the Sites. Only some of these categories of information identify you directly, but each category offers some information about your interests and
        activities that could be used to make inferences about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>IP Address.</strong>
        We record the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer when you visit the Sites. The IP address does not identify you personally, but it allows us
        to maintain communications with you as you move about the Sites.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cookies.</strong>
        We also collect information about your use of the Sites through cookies and similar technology. A "cookie" is a unique numeric code that we transfer to
        your computer so that we can keep track of your interests and preferences and recognize you as a return visitor to the Site. Cookie technology allows us to
        collect "clickstream" data, which is not personally identifying information, but which reflects your activities on the Site, including your interest in
        certain healthcare conditions. A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personal identifying information, but when you revisit the Site the
        cookie allows us to bring you the content and features likely to be of greatest interest to you based on your previous activities on the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the personal information collected on the Sites regarding you and your visit to the particular Site, we may collect and use the geo-location
        information from your use of the Sites or Applications. This means that when you use the Applications, we may use GPS or similar technology to determine
        your current location. Your geo-location services can be turned off for the Applications either in your mobile device settings and/or within the
        Applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will limit the collection of your personal information to that which is required to accomplish the purposes for which it is being collected. For
        example, if the purpose of the collection is to enable a pharmacy to submit a drug benefit claim to an adjudicator or benefit manager for payment, the
        pharmacy will only collect from you the information required to submit the claim.

    <p id="online-pharmacy-services">
        <strong>Online Pharmacy Services: </strong>
        Rexall offers a number of online pharmacy services. We have outlined some of these services in greater detail, to describe how your personal information is
        collected, used and disclosed in these contexts:<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>(i) Online Prescription Refill</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Online Prescription Refill service allows you to request a refill of a prescription from the same Rexall, Pharma Plus or Rexall Pharma Plus pharmacy from which it
        was originally dispensed and where refills remain (or where, in some provinces, a pharmacist is permitted to authorize refills) and may be refilled by law.
        The use of the Online Refill tool requires the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information across computer systems and networks.
        In light of the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that this information: (i) will be transmitted securely; (ii) will be error- or
        defect-free; or (iii) will not be improperly accessed or used by third parties. You are submitting this information over the Internet to us at your own
        risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your request for a prescription refill will be transmitted to the pharmacy location you have indicated. Once the pharmacy has received the request, it will
        be handled in the same manner as all refill requests, at all times being subject to the dispensing pharmacist's professional judgment and ethical
        responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        By submitting the prescription information (and other required information), our representatives (including a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician or
        assistant) will have access to your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to properly dispense a prescription and for your health and safety, the pharmacy may have to contact (without limitation):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the prescribing professional to discuss the refill request and your medication history and medical conditions;</li>
        <li>your health insurance provider in order to properly process your benefits (if applicable); and/or</li>
        <li>such other persons or entities as may be required in order to properly process your prescription refill request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the course of such discussions, your personal information may be disclosed to the persons noted above.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>(ii) Online Prescription Transfer Requests</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Online Prescription Transfer service allows you to transfer your prescriptions from another pharmacy to a Rexall, Pharma Plus or Rexall Pharma Plus pharmacy,
        or between Rexall/Pharma Plus/Rexall Pharma Plus pharmacies. The use of this service requires the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information
        across computer systems and networks. In light of the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that this information: (i) will be transmitted
        securely; (ii) will be error- or defect-free; or (iii) will not be improperly accessed or used by third parties. You are submitting this information over
        the Internet to us at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your request for a prescription transfer will be transmitted to the pharmacy location you have indicated in your request. Once the pharmacy has received
        your prescription, it will be handled in the same manner as all prescriptions, at all times being subject to the dispensing pharmacist's professional
        judgment and ethical responsibilities. By using this service, our representatives (including a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician or assistant) will have
        access to your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to properly transfer and/or dispense a prescription and for your health and safety, the pharmacy that you have transferred your prescription to
        may have to contact (without limitation):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the prescribing professional to discuss the transfer request and your medication history and medical conditions;</li>
        <li>your health insurance provider in order to properly process your benefits (if applicable); and/or</li>
        <li>such other persons or entities as may be required in order to properly process your prescription transfer request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the course of such discussions, your personal information may be disclosed to the persons noted above.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>(iii) Rexall Blood Pressure Tracker, powered by PharmaSmart </strong>
        (“<strong>BP Tracker Program</strong>”)
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the Sites and Applications, you can access the BP Tracker Program, which will allow you to record, track and access your blood pressure
        measurements and other personal information (for example your glucose and cholesterol levels and your weight/BMI).To access the BP Tracker Program, you
        will need to register your Blood Pressure Check Card (“Card”) on the Sites and Applications by entering the Unique Access Code (“UAC”) found on the Card,
        along with other personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also record your blood pressure measurements at certain Rexall, Pharma Plus, Rexall Pharma Plus pharmacies with your Card, using the PharmaSmart Blood Pressure Kiosks (“Kiosks”). The
        Kiosks are owned and operated by Pharma-Smart International Inc. (“PharmaSmart”).
    </p>
    <p>
        The blood pressure data and results obtained from the Kiosks are processed and maintained in a database managed by PharmaSmart. Further, any information,
        including personal information, that you record in the BP Tracker Program through the Sites and Applications is also processed and maintained by
        PharmaSmart, in order to provide you with these services on behalf of Rexall. More information regarding Rexall’s relationship to third parties service
        providers, such as PharmaSmart, is contained below.
    </p>
    <p>
        The personal information obtained through your use of the Kiosks or through the BP Tracker Program portion of the Sites and Applications will be accessible
        by all pharmacists practicing at the pharmacy where the Card has been registered, and will be shared with Rexall, PharmaSmart, and other third party service
        providers that manage the Sites and Applications and perform services in relation to the BP Tracker Program on behalf of Rexall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once enrolled, your personal information relating to the BP Tracker Program will be accessible to a pharmacist any time he/she accesses your patient
        profile. Should your blood pressure readings fall outside the target range, the pharmacist will be alerted to this fact when he/she views your patient
        profile at the time you receive prescription services. Based on this information, your pharmacist may provide you with certain patient services and
        information, including providing a consultation and information on hypertension/hypotension, as applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your pharmacist may also follow-up with your health care practitioner. In the course of such discussions, your personal information may be disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to subscribe to email/text message reminders or notifications relating to the BP Tracker Program, these communications may be sent to you by
        PharmaSmart or by one of our other third party service providers.
