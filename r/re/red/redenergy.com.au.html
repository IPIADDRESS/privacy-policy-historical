<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>This website is operated by Red Energy Ltd  ABN 60 107 479 372 (<strong>Red Energy</strong>) under the domain name www.redenergy.com.au.</p>

outlined in
this policy are subject to any rights or obligations we may
have to handle personal information in accordance with law.
This policy only
applies if
you are using this website as an individual, and not if you
are using it on behalf of a company. </p>
<p> Obviously you will need to give us some personal information
so that we can supply energy to you (if you are a customer)
and to provide
some of the features available on this website. It is important
that this personal information and any other information you
give us is correct and
that you tell us if there is any change to it. </p>

any accounts
that you
add to your online profile in the future. </p>

<p> Where this involves transferring your personal information
to another country, we observe applicable privacy law and
principles.</p>
<p> Otherwise we will only release your personal information and
collect other information about you if you authorise us
to do this, if we are legally
required or authorised to, or to enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li> carry out credit checks or otherwise assess your creditworthiness;
