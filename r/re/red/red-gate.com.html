        <h1>Legal information	</h1>
        <h2><br>
        Our privacy policy</h2>
        <p>          Red Gate (which means here Red Gate Software Limited) respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security. </p>
        <p>This privacy policy sets out our privacy practices.  Please take time to review this privacy policy as it tells you how your personal information will be treated by us. </p>
        <p>Any questions regarding our privacy policy should be directed to Red Gate's privacy policy manager at <a href="mailto:privacy@red-gate.com">privacy@red-gate.com</a>, or alternatively see the section "<a href="#contact">Contacting us</a>".</p>
        <h2>Use of information</h2>
        <p>          Red Gate will not collect any personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Examples of such information are: name, company, postal address, email address, phone number and product commentary.</p>
        <p>We will use the personal information provided to us in order to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>process orders submitted by you;</li>
          <li>	customize the service we provide to you;</li>
          <li>	administrate or otherwise carry out our obligations in relation to any agreement you have with us;</li>
          <li>	verify your identity (for example if you participate in any promotions administered by us);</li>
          <li>	anticipate and resolve any problems with any goods or services supplied to you;</li>
          <li>	carry out market research and surveys and track sales data;</li>
          <li>	send you our newsletter, where this is requested by you;</li>
          <li>	to send you follow-up communications relating to software downloaded from our site; and</li>
          <li>	send you information about our other products and services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may collect any personal information provided by you to us through this website  or via one of our telephone operators, or we may collect this information through your email or other communications with us.  Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in the privacy policy.</p>
        <p>We may also ask you for other optional information such as what sort of equipment/device/software you use and what other subjects interest you.  If you choose to give us this information, we will use it to help us to provide you with the best possible service that is personalized to your needs and preferences.</p>
        <p>Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we can tailor our services for you.</p>
        <p>We also collect information from you if you choose to take part in any of our on-site surveys or promotions.  We will use this information to administer the promotion and help us to plan other promotions.</p>
        <p>Certain Red Gate services, such as payment processing, are offered in conjunction with our business partners.  In such cases, we may need to share your personal information with them in order to provide these services.  Please note that certain services may be unavailable if you do not want to disclose the personal information you are asked for.</p>
        <h2> Log files/IP addresses</h2>

You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on our site.</p>
        <p>Red Gate may share non-personal aggregate or summary, information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties, such as information relating to the number of users linking to our site from their sites but Red Gate does not sell or share any information at the individual level. </p>

        <h2>Information about products and services</h2>
        <p>It is very important to us that we provide you with the highest level of service.

        <p>Red Gate may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or other news groups available to its users.  Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We have implemented technology and policies to help safeguard your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use.

        <h2>Third party sites</h2>
        <p>We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our site and recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you linked to our site from a third party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party site and recommend that you check the policy of that third party site and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</p>
        <h2>Transfers of your personal information outside of the European Economic Area</h2>
        <p>Information you provide to us is not routinely transferred by us to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) although it may happen if at any point one of our servers is temporarily located in a country outside the EEA or if one of our service providers is located in a country outside of the EEA.  If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information will be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.</p>
