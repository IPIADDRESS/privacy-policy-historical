      <h1>RedWeek.com Privacy Policy</h1>
Version 2 (Posted April 20, 2007)

<p>
  We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our
  commitment to the privacy of our users. The following discloses our
  information gathering and usage practices.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Privacy of user information</b>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or give away user information except in
      cases where you specifically request it. If you participate in
      the RedWeek Exchange Program, critical information required to process 
      the deposit of your week and your exchange reservation will be 
      shared with our partner company to complete the transaction. By 
      depositing your week or reserving an exchange with RedWeek.com, you 
      agree to allow RedWeek or our partner to communicate with the 
      resort and/or management company to exchange necessary information. 
      Your information will only be used to complete this transaction, 
      and will otherwise be held private and confidential. 
     </p>

     <p>
      Occasionally we may run promotions in partnership with resort 
      developers where you will be given the option to receive more information.  In	
      this case, we will provide your contact information to the resort to follow
      through on your request.  You will never be tricked into signing
      up for anything.  Options to receive more information will always
      be clearly explained to you and your participation in any
      promotion is strictly optional.
     </p>
				  
     <p>
      If you add a posting to RedWeek.com, your contact information will 
      not be made public, unless you choose to enter additional contact 
      information into the Details section. Otherwise, RedWeek.com
      members will contact you via the form on your posting page, which will
      deliver the correspondence to the e-mail address you have provided
      us with. Your e-mail address will not be exposed to the member who 
      contacted you until you reply.  If you send an inquiry through 
      RedWeek.com, the person you contacted will have your e-mail
      address for further direct correspondence.
    </p>
  </li>
   
  <li>
    <b>How your information is used for internal purposes and secured</b>
    <p>
      To use our site, you must have cookies enabled on your browser.
      Cookies allow us to collect valuable data regarding your visit
      to our site and use them to deliver content and services that are
      relevant to you.  Any data that we collect from you is used strictly
      for internal purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to secure the transmission
      of your credit card information.  This software encrypts all
      information you input and keeps it in a highly secure environment,
      protected from access by unauthorized parties.  It is important for
      you to protect yourself from unauthorized use of your password by
      logging off when finished using RedWeek.com.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Conditions of contact by RedWeek.com</b>
    <p>
     As a registered RedWeek.com user, you'll receive our monthly e-mail
     newsletter and any other subscriptions you request. Additionally,
     you may receive e-mails associated with your activities on the site
     (password requests, posting expiration notices, renewal notices, etc.).
     If you participate in the RedWeek Exchange Program, e-mails associated 
     with your exchange activity may come from our partner company.
     You will not receive non-activity related e-mails from this partner.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Advertising and third party links</b>

    <p>
      Some RedWeek.com advertisers and affiliate partners may request
      information directly from you, or link to sites that do so.  We do
      not endorse or have control over content or policies of third party
      Web sites.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Updates to our information practices</b>

    <p>
      We may need to make changes to our information practices or alter
      the functionality of our Web site.  You are responsible for
      staying alert of changes in this policy.
    </p>
