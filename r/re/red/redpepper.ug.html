            <p align="justify"><strong>Notification of Changes to This Policy</strong>&nbsp; <br>
                <br>
              Red Pepper Online is continually improving and adding new functionality   and features to its website while and improving and adding to our existing   products, services, and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in   the law, and the changing nature of technology, Red Pepper Online's data   practices will change from time to time.

            <p align="justify"><strong>Notification to Advertisers on Our Advertising   Policy</strong><br>
                <br>
              Red Pepper Online is intermittently adding new features   and functionalities to the website. As it were, while improving the existing   products, services, and programs, we have two categories of advertising   sections. <br>
              <br>
              Content Driven Sections: With the exception of the Pictorial   section, these will include the general pages that involve mostly content-based   features. These sections are: Subscribe, About Us, Advertising, Privacy Policy,   Contact Us, News Headlines, Gossip, Political Hysteria, Business, Spot Light, 3   Am, Columnists, Hyena's Whopper, Pepper Sport, Archives and Link To   Us.<br>
              <br>
              Context (Application) Driven Sections: These sections involve   strictly sponsored pages because of the applications involved in running and   managing them. For now, these sections are: Love Connection and Chat Room. The   Pictorial section is also included here because of the nature of the content   gathering process that goes into acquiring the best images from the best   possible photographers.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Information Collected and Stored   Automatically</strong><br>
                <br>
              In addition to the information you provide when   you use our website, uses technology to collect anonymous information about the   use of website. For example, we use technology to track how many visitors access   our website, the date and time of their visit, the length of their stay, and   which pages they view. We also use technology to determine which web browsers   our visitors use and the address from which they accessed Red Pepper Online (for   example, if they connected to a Red Pepper Online website by clicking on one of   our banner ads). This technology does not identify you personally. <br>
              <br>

              <br>
              While no method of data transmission is guaranteed against unlawful   third party interception or other misuse, Red Pepper Online uses commercially   reasonable efforts to ensure protection of your data including industry-standard   encryption and offline security methods in our physical facilities (e.g., your   data is protected onsite by our Information Assets Protection Policy).</p>
