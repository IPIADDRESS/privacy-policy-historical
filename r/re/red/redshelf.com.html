In order to file a request to anonymize, End User can contact help@redshelf.com. As a result of such (confirmed) request, RedShelf will de-identify as much personal information as possible, given the restrictions mentioned in section 5.3. After a RedShelf account has been anonymized, RedShelf will have no means whatsoever to retrieve/re-identify any User Information, any Access Rights Information or any Usage Data or any other information linked to such anonymized End User. End User will be warned thereof and asked to confirm his request through email (see section 5.2).</p>
<p><strong>5.2.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Final notice </strong>– Prior to proceeding with the anonymization of an End User’s account, RedShelf will notify such End User: (i) to inform End User that the anonymization of his/her account will be permanent and not-reversible; (ii) if applicable, to inform End User that he/she will lose access to any and all Content; (iii) to ask End User to confirm his/her request to de-identify his/her personal information; (iv) to ask the End User for feedback on our services and the reason for anonymizing. RedShelf will notify End User based on the email address RedShelf has on record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.3.&nbsp; Exceptions/ limitations:</strong></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<ul>a.&nbsp;<u>Active access rights</u> - End Users who still have active access rights to certain Digital Content, will irreversibly lose access to such Content upon anonymization, and RedShelf will only proceed with such anonymization (i) after such End User explicitly confirms the Digital Content can be de-activated; and (ii) to the extent that no other limitations preclude anonymization (see this Section 5.3);&nbsp;</ul>
<ul>b.&nbsp;<u>Accessed content less than 2 years ago</u> – In case End User has accessed any Digital Content in the 2 years prior to the anonymization request, User cannot be de-identified;</ul>
<ul>c.&nbsp;<u>Transaction data</u> – Certain User information contained in transaction data cannot be removed from RedShelf’s records for tax, audit and liability purposes, and will therefore survive any un-subscription or request for anonymization;</ul>
<ul><em>d.&nbsp;<u>Inclusive Access</u> – For Institutional End Users, the Institution through which an End User was provided access to Content on the RedShelf Platform, has authority over their students’ personal data. Therefore, RedShelf cannot independently anonymize information of Institutional End User linked to an Institution’s Inclusive Access Program and the following restrictions apply:</em></ul>
<ul><em>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual request from End User – Institutional End Users cannot request to have their account anonymized directly by RedShelf, but are advised to contact their Institution’s administration, who will then coordinate with RedShelf over any such request. In any case, RedShelf can only anonymize user accounts to the extent described in section 5.3. a. through c.<br></em></ul>
<ul><em>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students with Continued access – In the event the Institutional End User graduates, or for any other reason is no longer enrolled in or linked to the Institution, but still has active access rights to certain content, such Institutional End User will have Continued Access. RedShelf will keep the personal information unless and until such End User requests and confirms that RedShelf anonymize his/her account, pursuant to sections 5.1 through 5.3.</em></ul>
<ul><em>iii.&nbsp; &nbsp;Institution’s request to anonymize – In the event an Institution directs RedShelf to de-identify certain or all Personally Identifiable Information relating to its students, RedShelf will only do so to the extent described in section 5.3. a. through c.</em></ul>
<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p><strong>6.1.&nbsp; RedShelf’s Security measures</strong>&nbsp;– RedShelf uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of RedShelf’s systems and End Users’ personal information. These measures can only be effective to the extent End User applies equally reasonable precautionary measures.&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Identification </u>– RedShelf verifies End User’s identity (through double authentication) before granting account access to his/her account and Content, or before making corrections to End User’s User Information or User Content.&nbsp; However, END USER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF HIS/HER LOGIN INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.
</ul>
<ul>b. <u>Security Incidents</u> – If RedShelf learns of a security systems breach, RedShelf will electronically notify both the relevant authorities (security breach agencies) as well as impacted End Users so that they can take appropriate protective steps. REDSHELF THEREFORE INSISTS END USER TO KEEP HIS/HER USER INFORMATION UP TO DATE AT ALL TIMES. RedShelf may post a notice on redshelf.com if a security breach occurs.<br></ul>
<p><strong>6.2.&nbsp; No warranty</strong>&nbsp;– RedShelf cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information End User transmits to RedShelf, and End User does so at his/her own risk. Once RedShelf receives End User’s transmission of information, RedShelf makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that RedShelf does not guarantee that such information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. No data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. SECURITY MECHANISMS IN THE SERVICES HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS.</p>
