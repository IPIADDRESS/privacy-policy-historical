                        <strong>A. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY REDSHELF</strong>
                    </p><ul>
                        <li>a. By creating an account on RedShelf you will be asked to provide personal information such
                            as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.
                        </li>
                        <li>b. When accessing content on RedShelf, we or one of our advertising partners, may send one
                            or more "cookies" to your computer. RedShelf may use both session cookies and
                            persistent cookies. Session cookies disappear after closing your browser. Persistent cookies
                            remain after closing your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to
                            RedShelf.
                        </li>
                        <li>c. "Automatically Collected" Information: When you access content on RedShelf or
                            open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your
                            system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected"
                            information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique device
                            or user ID, version of software installed, system type, the referring search query used to
                            locate content and pages on RedShelf, the content and pages that you access on RedShelf, the
                            dates and times that you visit RedShelf, and information from your Facebook account that you
                            make publicly available, which is provided to us by Facebook via the Facebook APIs.
                        </li>
                        <li>d. RedShelf does not store information used to complete and process payment transactions on
                            RedShelf. RedShelf utilizes third party payment gateway service providers to complete
                            transactions and, therefore, does not store your payment information.

                    </p><ul>
                        <li>a. RedShelf may also use the information that you provide or that we collect to serve you
                            with advertisements. Additionally, information is used to the extent necessary to comply
                            with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as a service provider.
                        </li>
                        <li>b. Your email address may be used, without additional consent, for administrative
                            communication such as notifying you of account activity, updates, customer service, address
                            possible copyright infringement, or to contact you regarding any content that you may have
                            posted to or purchase from RedShelf.
                        </li>
                        <li>c. Information is also utilized to understand usage trends of our users, add new and upgrade
                            current services provided by RedShelf, and improve the cosmetic appeal of user interfaces.
                        </li>
                        <li>d. RedShelf may use "Automatically Collected" information and "cookies"
                            information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it
                            during your visit or the next time you access RedShelf; (b) monitor aggregate site usage
                            metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (c) provide such metrics to
                            Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (d) track your entries,
                            submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
                        </li>

                        <li>a. RedShelf does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations
                            for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent.
                        </li>
                        <li>b. RedShelf may disclose aggregated or other types of non-personally identifiable
                            information to third parties for various purposes, including marketing or promotional uses.
                            For example, RedShelf may disclose non-personally identifiable information to interested
                            third parties to assist them in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns
                            of users on RedShelf.
                        </li>

                            to display to or on RedShelf – such as when you publish attribution credits for documents or
                            profile information – becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others
                            without restriction.
                        </li>
                        <li>d. Please be aware that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose
                            to display on RedShelf becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other
                            without restriction.
                        </li>
                        <li>e. We may disclose limited User information (such as email address, name, or usernames) to
                            affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: fulfill orders, conduct data
                            analysis, or assist RedShelf in improving or creating new services. These parties are
                            required to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and we authorize
                            only the use of User information to perform the services provided by them. We also require
                            these parties to use reasonable confidentiality and data security measures.
                        </li>
                        <li>f. RedShelf may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith
                            belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S.
                            Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or
                            warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
                        </li>
                        <li>g. RedShelf also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good
                            faith, is appropriate or necessary: to take precautions against liability; to protect
                            RedShelf from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves
                            against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to
                            protect the security or integrity of RedShelf; or to protect the rights, property, or
                            personal safety of RedShelf, our Users, or others.
                        </li>
                        <li>h. RedShelf shows aggregate information about content viewers/purchasers in our analytics
                            section. This information includes geographical information (city/state/country) of people
                            viewing the content, which content was viewed, when content was viewed, how many times
                            content was viewed, and how much time content was viewed for. This aggregate information is
                            available only to the owners/sellers of content posted to RedShelf.
                        </li>

                            RedShelf, in which case RedShelf will not be able to provide to you some of the features and
                            functionality found on RedShelf. You may update, correct, or delete your user information
                            and preferences at any time.

                        <li>b. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity
                            before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU ARE
