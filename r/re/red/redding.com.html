<b>Redding.com</b> is committed to protecting consumer privacy online.

We use this general information to aggregate information according to demographics, such as gender, geographic location, age, income or a combination of these or other demographics. </p>

<p>Like many other commercial sites, our sites may utilize an electronic file called a web beacon to count users who have visited a page or recognize users by accessing certain cookies. Our site and/or our partner web sites use web beacons in the following way: </p><ul><p></p>
<p></p><li> For auditing purposes and to collect information from the websites of certain partners. <p></p>

<p></p></li><li> Information recorded through these web beacons is used to report anonymous individual and/or aggregate information about our users from our partners. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners. </li></ul><p></p>
