<p style="margin-top:7px;"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" border="0" alt="Top"></a></p>
		
<h3>Part VI: Disclosure of Information Subject to Opt-Out or Opt-In Rights </h3>
<p>RCU and RCUSG do not disclose or share information regarding Members or other consumers in ways that give rise to “opt-out” or “opt-in” election rights that you may have heard about. If we change this disclosure so that you would have additional opt-out rights, we will notify you in advance. If you receive material from us promoting the products or services of third parties, we handle the promotion internally or by using one of our service providers without sharing information about you with the third party.</p>

<h3>Part VII: Disclosure of Information about Former Members and Customers</h3>
<p>We disclose information about former Members and former customers only as allowed or required by law. Subject to this limitation, we may disclose any category of information we have about you.</p>

<h3>Part VIII: Our Protection of the Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>Access to information about  you is limited to those employees who provide products or services to you.&nbsp; Our employees are trained and understand the  importance of safeguarding your information.&nbsp;  We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply  with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p>

If a new  disclosure will be subject to opt-out or opt-in rights, we will give you at  least 45 days advance notice before the new disclosure goes into effect, and we  will disclose the means by which you can opt-out of disclosure of non-public  personal information.</p>

<h3>Information on Public Records</h3>
<p>You may be aware that  businesses can obtain certain consumer information, such as that related to  mortgage loans, which is a matter of public record and available to anyone from  the County Recorder’s Office. Unfortunately, this information is often used by  companies to market their products and services directly to you. At times, they  also make references to the Credit Union or its affiliates, which may imply  that they obtained the information from us. The lenders’ names, as well as  certain details of the loans are included in the public records, and that is  where they obtain their data.</p>


<p style="margin-top:7px;"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/backtotop.gif" border="0" alt="Top"></a></p>

<h3>How to Remove Your Name from Credit Offers</h3>
<p>If you prefer not to receive pre-approved credit solicitations, you can write to the credit reporting agencies listed at right, or call <strong>(888) 5OPT-OUT (888-567-8688)</strong>. By removing your name, you will no longer receive unsolicited credit offers from the Credit Union, or other businesses, such as credit card companies, department stores and banks. When you call to remove your name from credit bureau lists, you will be given a choice to opt out for two years, or permanently. Even though your request becomes effective within a week of calling, it may take several months before you see a reduction in the amount of unsolicited offers of credit. </p>

<h3>How to Reduce "Junk" Mail</h3>
<p>For a $1 fee, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) sponsors Mail Preference Service (MPS), to help consumers limit the national advertising mail they receive. If you would like to reduce the amount of advertising you receive 
  from companies, you may register via the DMA consumer website at 
  <a href="javascript:showWarning('www.dmaconsumers.org');">www.dmaconsumers.org</a>, or send a letter, including your name, home address
  and signature, plus a $1 check or money order (payable to DMA), to:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px; font-weight: bold;">	Mail Preference Service <br>
	Direct Marketing Association  <br>
	PO Box 643  <br>
	Carmel, NY 10512-0643 </div>
	<br>

<p>By registering for this service, your name will be removed for five years from lists
used by direct mail companies that subscribe to MPS. Removing your name will not end all solicitations from businesses that do not subscribe to the service. To eliminate mail from those businesses, as well as mail addressed to "occupant" or "resident," write directly to each source. For more information, visit the DMA Consumer website at <a href="javascript:showWarning('www.dmaconsumers.org');">www.dmaconsumers.org</a>.</p>
