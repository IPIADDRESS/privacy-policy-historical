<div class="title">Privacy Policy</div>
<br>
This privacy policy is applicable to the website[s] accessible at <a href="http://www.redskins.com">www.redskins.com</a>
(collectively the "Site"), which is operated by Pro-Football, Inc. (collectively,
the "PROVIDERS", "we", "our", or "us").
The purpose of this privacy policy is to disclose to you what information we may
collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters
related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection
of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may
have collected from you. <br>
<br><br>
<b>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</b><br>
The following are the types of information we may collect:<br>
<br>
<b>Information You Provide Us</b><br>
Personal information that you provide to us, such as your user ID and password,
name, email address, telephone number, credit card, account number, physical address,
birth date, gender or zip code or other information may be collected via the Site.<br>
<br>
<b>Site Usage Information</b><br>
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit the Site.
For example, we may collect click-stream data and your IP address. <br>
<br>
<b>Email Communications</b><br>
When you open emails from the Site, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened
an email from us, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep
track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from us
and our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what types
of emails you have opted to and not to receive. <br>
<br>
<b>Information from Other Sources</b><br>
We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your personal
information. <br>
<br><br>
<b>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</b><br>
We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including
but not limited to those described below: <br>
<br>
<b>Registration</b><br>
You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally
identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password
in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including,
but not limited to, newsletters, contests, forums, fantasy or other subscription-based
services. <br>
<br>
All users must register when shopping at the Redskins Online Store site (http://store.redskins.com).
Our registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name,
age range, password, and e-mail address). You must be 13 years of age or older
to register. Registration helps us to provide you with an easy and personalized
shopping experience, with quick and simple checkout options. The customer contact
information you supply on the registration form will be used to send you e-mail
newsletters and updates about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product
information. In addition, the information is used, when necessary, to contact
you concerning the status of an order or to answer any of your questions. The
Redskins may selectively choose to share this information with other divisions
of our business and/or third parties.<br>
<br>
At all times, you have the option of "opting out" of receiving future
e-mail updates by visiting our choice/opt-out form. <br>
If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required,
information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more
about our customers and is used to improve our customers' shopping experience
with us.
<p><b>Newsletters and Site Emails</b><br>
We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site,
about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners
and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering
for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership
for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email
subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some
instances, in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails. <br>
<br>
<b>Contests or Sweepstakes</b><br>
We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site which may require
registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact
you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related
purposes. We may post publicly some of your information on the Site, such
as on a winners page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. In some
instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest
or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information. In those cases,
where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we have
no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review
the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or
sweepstakes before participating. <br>
<br>
<b> Surveys or Voting</b><br>
From time-to-time we may request personally identifiable information from
you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have
the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times,
you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
As with many websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies,"
which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you
allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your
web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site
easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking
how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular
and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on
data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things,
to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site
to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not
want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt
out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser;
however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience
if you have disabled the use of cookies. <br>
<br>
<b> IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</b><br>
We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system
administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and
sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your
computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer
by its IP address. When you request web pages from the Site, our computers
log your IP address. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers
when you request web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such
information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type
of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal
information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive
at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in
the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising,
and the like. <br>
<br>
<b> Order Information</b> <br>
Customers use an order form to request or purchase information or products.
When you place an order, we collect contact information, such as your shipping
and e-mail addresses, and financial information, such as your account or credit
card numbers. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders
and information about us to our customers and to get in touch with them when
necessary. Financial information is used to bill the customer for products.
You also have the option of ordering products over the telephone, and you
may choose to pay by check. <br>
<br>
If you register with the site, we can store your credit card information on
file on our secure servers for your use on future orders. If you select this
option, you will be able to store multiple credit card information in "My

<b> WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED</b><br>
At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others
for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information
may be shared with others: <br>
<br>
Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing
repetitive information from customer lists, Site analysis, analyzing data, providing
marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer
service. These entities have access to personally identifiable information needed
to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. <br>
<br>
Promotional Offers: We may send offers by email to you on behalf of other parties.
When we do this, we do not give that party your name and address. If you do not
want to receive such offers, you may opt out in response to the email, or change
your preferences by visiting [Insert link to URL where preferences can be changed].
<br>
<br>
Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information such as demographics
and Site usage statistics with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When
this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your
personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
Opt-in and Opt-out Programs: Throughout the Site you may be presented with opportunities
to receive special offers from third parties. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask
you if you would like your information to be shared. If you do choose to have
your information shared, in an effort to protect you, third parties who have access
to personally identifiable information must abide by the current Site privacy
policy. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other
companies, and you should review the privacy practices of such Web sites prior
to providing your personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
Third-Party Ad Serving: The Site may use a third party network advertiser to serve
the advertisements on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display
advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have
visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for
products or Web sites you might be interested in. Although advertisers or other
companies do not have access to the Site cookies, the Site's advertisers and sponsors
may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose
to have your cookies enabled in your browser. Cookies allow third party advertisers
to show you advertisements or content you might be interested in. Other companies'
use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please

in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out"
procedures of third party ad servers we may use. <br>
<br>
Partners Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may share your information (including,
without limitation, personally identifiable information) with subsidiaries and
affiliates of PROVIDERS. <br>
<br>
Business Transfers: The Site or a PROVIDER may be sold along with its assets,
or other transactions may occur in which your personally identifiable information
is one of the business assets transferred. In such a case, your personally identifiable
information, which we have gathered, may be one of the business assets we transfer.
<br>
<br>
Legal Process: In the event we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders
or other legal process your personally identifiable information may be disclosed
pursuant to such subpoena, court order or legal process, which may be without
notice to you. <br>
<br>
<b>Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards</b><br>

other parties. The PROVIDERS cannot ensure the security of any information

will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose
personal information in these areas. <br>
<br>
<b>Links to Other Web Sites</b><br>

onto a different web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors
and others that may use the Site's logo as part of a cobranding agreement.

data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published
privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to our Site, you should
