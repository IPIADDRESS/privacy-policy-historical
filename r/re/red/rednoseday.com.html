<h2>Fundraising dos and don'ts</h2>

<ul><li>If you are fundraising for Red Nose Day 2017, please make sure you stay legal – and take a moment to read the following guidelines and information before you start:</li>
	<li>Please make sure your fundraising materials (e.g. posters) include the line: ‘In support of Comic Relief, registered charity 326568 (England/Wales); SC039730 (Scotland)’.</li>
	<li>Your fundraising materials must not suggest that you represent the charity, only that you are fundraising in support of us.</li>
	<li>If you are raising money in the course of a business, deducting any amount to cover costs, or splitting the money raised between Comic Relief and another charity, then you’ll need a Fundraising Agreement. Contact us <a class="link link--light-grey inline" href="http://www.comicrelief.com/contact-us" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to get one.</li>
	<li>We don’t advise you to collect money in a public place or door to door. If you do choose to do so, you’ll need your own licence from your local authority (you should find details about this on your local authority’s website).</li>
	<li>If children (under 16) are involved in fundraising in any way, please make sure that they have permission from their parent or guardian, and are properly supervised by a responsible adult. Children should never approach strangers about fundraising.</li>
	<li>If you are planning any type of lottery (such as a raffle, tombola or sweepstake), please be aware that there are strict rules about what you can do. For England, Wales and Scotland, the Gambling Commission publishes useful guidance on lotteries at <a class="link link--light-grey inline" href="http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk" id="" rel="" target="_blank" title="">gamblingcommission.gov.uk</a>. In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action publishes a good practice guide at <a class="link link--light-grey inline" href="http://www.nicva.org" id="" rel="" target="_blank" title="">nicva.org</a>.</li>
	<li>You should always consider whether you need appropriate insurance cover for your fundraising activity. If necessary, carry out a risk assessment and make sure participants are fully briefed about the activity.</li>
	<li>For more information on fundraising please see the Institute of Fundraising website, <a class="link link--light-grey inline" href="http://www.how2fundraise.org" id="" rel="" target="_blank" title="">how2fundraise.org</a>.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Disclaimer – please read!</strong></p>

<p>Please be safe! Whilst we really appreciate your support, Comic Relief is not responsible for organising, supervising or hosting your Red Nose Day activity. All activities, and participation in them, are at the organisers’ and participants’ own risk. Your activity should not pose a danger to you or any onlookers.</p>

<p>Comic Relief does not accept responsibility or liability for any loss or damage, or for any death or personal injury, arising out of any fundraising activity including liability as a result of negligence (except death or personal injury caused by Comic Relief’s negligence).</p>

<p>If you wish to donate to Comic Relief or sponsor anyone for Red Nose day 2017, please note that your donation or sponsorship payment is non-refundable. If you sponsor someone your sponsorship is not conditional on the activity being completed.</p>

<p><span id="safety-tips">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Safety tips for parents &amp;&nbsp;guardians</h2>

<ul><li>If your child would like to fundraise for Red Nose Day, here are a few safety tips to keep in mind:</li>
	<li>Please make sure your child understands that they need your permission before they start any fundraising.</li>
	<li>We recommend that a responsible adult properly supervises children under the age of 16 who are involved in fundraising.</li>
	<li>We recommend that children don’t approach strangers to ask them for money or to get involved in their fundraising activity.</li>
	<li>Please always take care when publishing any information about children, in particular their surname, school name, home address, or photo to ensure that under-16s are not easily identifiable.</li>
	<li>Always check with other parents/guardians before you involve their children in fundraising, especially if their activity is being photographed or filmed.</li>
	<li>We recommend that an adult looks after any money that is collected, and is responsible for paying the money to us. We don’t recommend that children pay us money directly or send us their details.</li>
	<li>The best way for your child to fundraise is by setting them up with their own Red Nose Day Giving Page, which we have specifically tailored for under-16s. Giving Pages for under-16s can’t be found through any search on rednoseday.com and a parent/guardian’s email address is the only one we ever request and contact (we will only use this email address to communicate specifically about the U16 Giving Page). Please see our Online Safety Tips if you or your child are setting up a Red Nose Day Giving Page. You can help your child with their fundraising by downloading a kids’ sponsorship form.</li>
	<li>Please read our <a class="link link--light-grey inline" href="#privacy" id="" rel="" target="" title="">privacy policy</a> for information on how we take care of personal details.</li>
