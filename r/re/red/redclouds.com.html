1. What information do we collect? How do we use it?<br>

When you register, we need to know your name, e-mail address, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, mailing address,<br>

phone number and payment information. This allows us to safely process and fulfill your purchase process, as well<br>

unauthorized access.<br>

3. What about "cookies"?<br>

do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as linking and<br>

reselling. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent<br>

that. Sometimes at RedClouds we do use cookies during the purchase process, to have your own PC remember<br>

what kind of information was entered. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our<br>

customers need and not to track your individual usage patterns.<br>

Only in rare circumstances will RedClouds contact consumers via telephone to confirm purchase or resolve disputes.<br>

7. Will RedClouds notify me to changes in the way it uses Personally Identifiable Information?<br>

able to do so by responding to RedClouds. If you have any concern about privacy at RedClouds, please contact us<br>
