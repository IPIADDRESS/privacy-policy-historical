      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>1. Introduction</span></h2>
        <p class="content">This Privacy Policy discloses and covers all of the privacy   practices of Red Books LLC ("REDBOOKS" or the "Company"), including as   they relate to REDBOOKS’s website and related services (collectively,   the "Site").  In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us", "our" and other   similar references mean REDBOOKS and "you" and "your" and other similar   references mean a specific user of the Site.<br>
          <br>
          We understand and respect the privacy concerns of our users, and   we have made it a critical focus of the Site to protect the   confidentiality and security of the personal information you provide   us.  We have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we   collect, use and share your personal information, and our privacy   practices in general.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.  BY ACCESSING   OR USING THE SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND   AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY   POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PLEASE EXIT   THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>2. The Information We Collect</span></h2>
        <p class="content">We may collect two types of information:  Personally Identifiable Information ("<u>PII</u>") and Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("<u>Non-PII</u>").<br>
          <br>
          PII is information that identifies a specific user of the Site.    When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as when you   register to use the Site, we may ask you to provide certain information   about yourself that we will collect and store.  You do not have to   engage in the activities in which we ask you to provide such   information.  But if you choose to do so, we may ask you to provide   certain personal information, such as your first and last name, gender,   email address and date of birth.  Depending on what activity you are   engaged in, some of the information that we request will be identified   as mandatory or as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory   information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be   permitted to engage in that activity.<br>
          <br>
          Non-PII is information that identifies your computer and its   navigational patterns through the Site (but not a specific user).  We   may automatically collect Non-PII information when you visit the Site,   through the use of a variety of tools including cookies (small text   files that are stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes   and which contains information about that user’s computer), or other   available data analysis or collection technologies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>3. How We Use and Share Information</span></h2>
        <p class="content">We use the information we collect to (a) provide the services you   request; (b) notify you of promotions, special events, new services and   special offers; (c) improve our product offerings, customer service and   overall experience; (d) improve the content, operation, appearance and   utility of the Site; (e) conduct surveys, research and evaluations; (f)   troubleshoot and resolve disputes; (g) gather demographic data and (h)   accomplish other administrative tasks.<br>
          <br>
          We may share your information collected on the Site with our   subsidiaries and other affiliated companies, and with other vendors and   business partners, including marketing partners, with whom we work   (collectively, "Our Affiliates").  This includes companies who provide   business services to us or on our behalf such as to market products or   services to you, monitor Site activity, serve Site content, help to   maintain our customer database, administer e-mails, surveys or other   contests.  We also reserve the right to disclose your information in   good faith as required by law, in response to legal process including   law enforcement requests, with any person or entity that has acquired   all or any part of our business or assets, and where needed to prevent   fraud and to protect the safety, property, or legal rights of users of   the Site or Our Affiliates.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>4. Unsubscribe or Opt Out</span></h2>
        <p class="content">If you decide that you are no longer interested in receiving   email communications from us, you may follow the instructions in our   emails to unsubscribe from our email list or send us an email at   info@redbooks.com.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>5. Privacy Policies of Third Parties</span></h2>
        <p class="content">This Privacy Policy only addresses the use, storage and   disclosure of information that we collect from you.  Other websites,   such as websites you may have clicked-on that directed you to the Site   or websites that may be accessible to you by clicking-through the Site,   have their own privacy policies regarding data collection, use and   disclosure practices.  If you visit any such website, we encourage you   to review that website’s privacy policy.  We are not responsible for the   policies or practices of third parties.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>6. Editing and Requesting Your Information</span></h2>
        <p class="content">We will permit you to change your profile settings.  Even after   you change or remove information from your profile, copies of your   information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been   shared with others or it was copied or stored by other users.  We may   also be required to retain your information by law or for legitimate   business purposes, such as to prevent identity theft or other   misconduct.<br>
          <br>
          We will permit you to request a copy of your PII that we have   collected about you by contacting the Company at the address below.  You   can also correct factual inaccuracies in this information by contacting   the Company.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="innerDiv">
        <h2><span>7. Storage and Security</span></h2>
        <p class="content">We believe the security of your information is a serious issue   and we are committed to protecting the information we receive from you.    We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the   loss, misuse and alteration of your information under our control.    Notwithstanding such measures, please be aware that no security measures   are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of   any information transmitted to or from the Site.  We also are not   responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any   such information.</p>

        <p class="content">You acknowledge and agree that all discussion for ratings,   comments, bulletin board service, chat rooms and/or other message or   communication facilities on the Site (collectively, "Public Forums") are   public and not private communications, and others may read your   communications without your knowledge.  We do not control or endorse the   content, messages or information found in any Public Forum, and,   therefore, we specifically disclaim any liability concerning Public   Forums and any claims or injuries resulting from your participation in   any Public Forum, including any objectionable content.  Generally, any   communication which you post to the Site (whether in chat rooms,   discussion groups, message boards or otherwise) is considered to be   non-confidential.  If particular web pages permit the submission of   communications that will be treated by us as confidential, that fact   will be stated on those pages.<br>
          <br>
          By posting comments, messages or other information (collectively,   "Material") on the Site or any Public Forum, you irrevocably grant us a   non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual right   and license to use, copy, modify, adapt, publish, translate and   distribute such Material (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to   incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology now known   or hereafter developed for the full term of any copyright that may   exist in such Material, without territorial or time limitations, and to   sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, and you   represent and warrant that, if you are not the owner of such Material,   that the owner of such Material has expressly granted you the right to   grant the foregoing license to REDBOOKS.  You acknowledge and agree   that any other user may access, view, store or reproduce the material   for that user's personal use, and that you shall have no recourse   against us for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of   any proprietary right in your communications to us.
