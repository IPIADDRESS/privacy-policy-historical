<h1>What is Redtag's Privacy &amp; Security Policy?</h1>

<p>Redtag, Inc. ("Redtag") has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. As this policy may change from time to time, please check back periodically.</p>
<p>Redtag uses the information we collect about you to, among other things, process orders. When you register at Redtag, we collect your name, email addresses, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date in order to process and fulfill your order. In some instances, products ordered at Redtag are shipped directly from our vendors, and some of your information is shared with these vendors to enable them to fulfill and ship your order.</p>
<p>When you sign up for Redtag Auction Alerts, we need only an email address to send you the email topics that you have selected. We also use your email address to send you email notice of your bid and order status, and we may use your email address to send you notice of upgrades or changes to Redtag, new services, and special offers. You may choose not to receive any of these emails when you register or at a later date by accessing Redtag Auction Alerts.</p>
<p>We occasionally will ask for additional information from you. For instance, we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address in connection with a contest or other promotional feature in which you participate, so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We may offer contests or promotions with third parties; policies concerning use of your personal data gathered in connection with any such contest or promotion will be specifically set forth in the rules and policies applicable to the contest or promotion.</p>
<p>Redtag offers a service called "Tell a Buddy" that allows you to notify friends about open auctions. Please note, however, that Redtag opposes the practice of sending unsolicited commercial emails, also known as "spam." Therefore, we request that you send "Tell a Buddy" emails only to people known by you who may be interested in the auction. If someone asks you not to send these emails to him or her, please comply.</p>
<p>When you bid on an item, you must enter the amount of your bid, your Redtag Login ID and your password. Your initials, city and state and your bid will be publicly available in the Current Winning Bids history.</p>
<p>Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content. Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b><br>"Cookies" are pieces of information that are passed to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Redtag uses cookies to recognize repeat visitors, to automatically enter your login ID in our bid form, and to provide additional features to make shopping at Redtag easier and more efficient. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can turn them off using your browser's settings.</p>

<p><b>Sharing data with third parties </b><br>
Upon registration with Redtag, each of our customers is assigned a random and anonymous customer number, which we use to track customer orders. This customer number is different from any custom login ID selected by you and may be passed to third party vendors with whom we work to provide more efficient and relevant services to our users. Our anonymous customer numbers may be used to measure traffic and visiting patterns on Redtag and on other websites on the Internet. We may also compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregated basis, and may share such aggregated data with selected third parties. Redtag can (and you authorize us to) release any information about you when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to comply with law, enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, enforce other Redtag rights, or protect the rights, property or safety of Redtag, the Redtag Web site, our users, or others. Further, as permitted by applicable law, Redtag can (and you authorize us to) disclose your login ID, name, street, address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, company and any other information in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity whenever Redtag in its sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate. Nothing in this privacy policy shall affect or restrict Redtag's ability to sell or transfer such data as part of a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets and you consent to our doing so.  In addition, we may share information about you with third parties as necessary to complete a transaction requested by you and we may share information about you with our business partners, affiliates or other third parties if we believe that these other parties may have information of interest to you.  You may change your personal information at any time, including email address, phone number, mailing address, and credit card information in My Account, located in My Page. You may choose whether or not to receive Outbid and order processing emails in My Account and in My Mailbox. By registering at Redtag, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Redtag. In the event of changes in our privacy policy, this page will be updated with the current information.</p> 

<p><b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by Advertising.com, our Web advertising partner, and other third-party advertising companies. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information regarding your cookies, disabling your cookies, and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></p>

<p><b>Links</b><br>This Web site may contain links to other web sites.  We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control or monitor the privacy practices of websites operated by others.  We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them.  Your use of other web sites is subject to the terms and conditions of those web sites, including the privacy policies of those web sites.</p>

<p><b>Children's Privacy</b><br>This Web site is designed for an adult audience only, and children should not use this Web site.  We will not intentionally collect online any personal information (such as a child's name or e-mail address) from children under the age of 13.  If you think that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us and we will address the issue.</p>

<p><font size="3">Security</font></p>
 
<p><b>How your information is encrypted </b><br>There are certain areas on the site where you may enter and submit additional information. Certain of these areas are encrypted using SSL encrypted transmissions between your Web browser and our Web server. This is designed to reduce the chance that someone (e.g. on your network at work or at your Internet service provider) may try to compromise your private information as it travels from your Web browser to our secure server. You'll know when transmitted data is encrypted by a security notice when you enter an encrypted page, and by the presence of an icon on your browser, either a key for Netscape or a lock for Microsoft Internet Explorer. The pages where you submit your account information, place a bid, and receive confirmation of a successful bid are all encrypted.  In addition, your credit card information is encrypted within the Redtag database and access to such information is restricted.  This system is unique and designed to provide you with additional security when purchasing items on Redtag.com.</p>

<p><b>Protecting your login ID and password</b><br>
Always keep your Redtag account number and password secret. They are your only identification for bidding purposes. If you receive information about a bid you did not place, or questionable communications regarding your account, please contact Redtag Customer Support immediately [Insert email address, link and phone number]. One potential way for someone to steal your login ID and password is if you bookmark any area on MyPage or a bid submission page. This is a concern if your browser is available to other people at work, home, or especially if you use a browser at a public internet cafe. You should not bookmark such pages and you should clear the browser cache and quit the browser completely when you are done surfing Redtag. We have also worked to protect you against such a mistake. Even if someone obtains both your login ID and password, the system is designed to restrict access to your credit card information because that field is cleared when they log in to My Page.</p>

<p><b>About SSL, security, and firewall problems</b><br> 
Some older browsers (such as IE 3.0.2) have known SSL bugs. These can result in the browser crashing on SSL pages or giving error messages. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of whatever browser you prefer. For AOL users, you may be able to upgrade your security by downloading and replacing the schannel.dll from Microsoft. For users behind corporate firewalls, you need to configure your web browser security settings. This includes setting https or secure proxy settings. To determine if you have such a security problem, you can edit a secure URL, replacing 'https' (secure) with 'http' (insecure). If the page works with http:// but not https://, then you have a problem with your security settings. You should contact your system administrator for assistance.</p>

<p><b>Technical Details About Encryption</b><br>
Redtag operates with a VeriSign Digital Server Certificate, featuring cryptographic techniques to reduce the risk that Digital IDs are not forged or tampered with. These techniques, developed by RSA Data Security, use a matched pair of encryption and decryption keys. This use of matched-key cryptography with a 1024-bit key length provides a level of security unavailable with conventional secret key cryptography.</p>
