	demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses the 
	information gathering and dissemination practice for the uBid.com
	web site. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want
	to help you make it so.
	</p><p>When you reserve or purchase travel services or other products
	through uBid.com, we will ask you to provide us with personal
	information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, 
	credit card information and other personal identifying information.
	We need this information in order to process your order or travel
	arrangements and need to share this personal information with the
	relevant airline, car rental agency, hotel, travel agency and/or
	other involved third party.
	</p><p>As a user of uBid.com, you have the option to engage in
	certain additional activities on the site, such as entering
	contests or sweepstakes, and receiving our e-mail alerts. It is 
	completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you
	elect to engage in these activities, however, uBid.com may
	require you to provide us with personal information, such as your
	name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal
	identifying information. uBid.comSkyAuction.com needs to
	collect this personal information for various reasons, which
	may include: (i) notifying sweepstakes or contest winners, 
	(ii) fulfilling prizes; (ii) disseminating our e-mail; 
	(iii) aggregating statistical information; and (iv) tracking 
	and verifying compliance with uBid.com policies and international,
	federal, state and local laws.
	</p><p>uBid.com recognizes and respects the importance of
	responsible use of your personal information. If you do not
	want the information you provide to uBid.com to be used to
	inform you of other products and special offers from uBid.com,
	and you indicate this preference when you provide the information,
	uBid.com will honor your preference. In case you change your
	mind or some personal information may change (such as your zip code),
	we provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data you
	give us. You can do this at the member information page or by 
	<a href="/action/custCare">contacting our Customer Support organization</a>.
	</p><h3>OPTING-OUT</h3><p>To keep you in control of your personal information and the
	communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of 
	receiving certain communications from uBid.com about 
	new features or services. If a guest objects to such use
	for any reason, you may stop that use, either 
	<a href="/action/custCare">by e-mail request to Customer Support</a>
	or by modifying your member information online.
	</p><p>Information provided when reserving or purchasing travel
	services through uBid.com, may be used for marketing and
	promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes
	described on, or linked to, each order form.
	</p><h3>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h3><p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when
	you visit our Web site. These companies may use information
	(not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) 
	about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
	advertisements on this site and other sites about goods 
	and services that may be of interest to you.
	</p><h3>THIRD PARTY COOKIES</h3><p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our 
	third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie"
	on your browser.
	</p><h3>USE OF TRAFFIC DATA</h3><p>Each time a visitor comes to our Web site, we collect some
	information to improve the overall quality of the online experience.
	This includes the visitor's IP address, referral data (e.g., the 
	the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking 
	through to the uBid.com Web site), and browser information.
	We collect visitor information for purposes of product monitoring,
	product improvement, and targeted advertising. We also count, 
	track, and aggregate all visitors' activity into our analysis
	of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where 
	traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the uBid.com
	properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information
	about you into group data, which may then be shared on an
	aggregated basis with our advertisers; but uBid.com will not
	disclose your individual identity or personal data without your
	permission. When uBid.com does present aggregated information
	to outside companies, no one is able to identify you or contact you.
	</p><h3>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</h3><p>An IP address is a number that's associated with your computer 
	whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers use your IP address to
	communicate with your computer.
	</p><p>uBid.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system
	administration, to report aggregate, or combined, information to
	our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When users
	request pages from the SkyAuction.com Web site, our servers log
	the user's IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses
	to anything personally identifiable, which means that your session
	will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. We can and will use
	IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to
	enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect
	our service, site, customers or others. 
	</p><h3>USE OF e-mail DATA</h3><p>uBid.com will use your e-mail address to send correspondence
	about reservation confirmations, purchases, important updates about
	your travel	plans, and newsletters. Members who sign up to receive
	newsletters and notifications of deals and travel specials, will 
	receive a reguarly scheduled newsletter, as well as occasional
	product-related announcements.</p><p>Users can choose to unsubscribe from uBid.com newsletters or
	product-related announcements at any time by following the unsubscribe
	instructions found in each e-mail or <a href="/action/custCare">by
	contacting our Customer Support organization</a>. 
	</p><h3>CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES</h3><p>uBid.com offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request
	certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information
	includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must
	answer survey questions about a range of other personal data. The
	information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's
	identity and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Participation
	in these contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary and the
	user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
	information. There are two situations in which uBid.com will
	divulge this information to a third party provided the user gives
	express consent: (1) A user may expressly choose to receive
	additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case
	the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to
	the advertiser; (2) Some of the contests may be hosted on the
	uBid.com site but administered by the sponsor; in such
	cases, the information a user provides is passed on to the third
	party as long as that user gives express consent. Because the rules
	and terms of each contest and sweepstakes can vary, all information
	about each contest and sweepstakes is clearly posted during the event.
	</p><h3>SURVEYS</h3><p>Occasionally SkyAuction.com conducts user surveys to better
	target our content to our audience. Participation in these surveys
	is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
	whether or not to disclose this information. We sometimes share
	the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our
	advertisers and partners. We never share any personally
	identifiable information with such third parties. 
	</p><h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3><p>Users should be aware that when you are on the uBid.com website,
	could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are
	links to other sites from SkyAuction.com pages that take you outside
	our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement or
	a SkyAuction.com more information link, the click takes you off
	the uBid.com site. This includes, but is not limited to,
	links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use
	uBid.com logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other
	sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit
	personal information.
	</p><p>This privacy policy does not extend to such third parties' use of such
	information, anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, 
	and therefore beyond the control of uBid.com, and is not to be
	applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental
	regulation. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our
	site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site
	that collects personally identifiable information.
	</p><h3>SECURITY</h3><p>SkyAuction.com has taken strong measures to protect the
	security of your personal information and to ensure that your
	choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions
	to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or
	disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
	</p><p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable
	information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us.
	We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your
	information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data
	transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
	As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information,
	uBid.com can not ensure or warrant the security of any information
	you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do
	so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our
	best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit
	card information is transmitted we use industry standard, 
	SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. SSL is a coding system that
	lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble data before
	you send it to us.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot ensure that all of your private
	communications and other personally identifiable information
	will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
	this Privacy Policy.  By way of example (without limiting the
	foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the
	government or third parties under certain circumstances, or
	third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
	or private communications.  We can (and you authorize us to)
	disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other
	government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe
	necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation
	of fraud, intellectual property infringement or other activity
	that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.  Therefore,
	although we will endeavor to protect your privacy as described
	in this Privacy Policy, we do not promise, and you should not
	expect, that your personally identifiable information or
	private communications will remain private.
	</p><p>Your SkyAuction.com account is password protected so that only
	you can access it and view the member information relevant to the
	account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to
	anyone. SkyAuction.com will never ask you for your password in
	an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are
	responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords
	and any account information.</p><h3>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</h3><p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the 
	uBid.com Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy,
	please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the uBid.com 
	Web site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean
	you accept those changes. Any such change, update or modification
	will be effective immediately upon posting to the uBid.com 
	Web site.</p><h3>CONTACTING THE WEB SITE</h3><p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, 
	the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, 
	you may <a href="/action/custCare">contact Customer Support via email</a> 
	or write to:</p><p>uBid.com
