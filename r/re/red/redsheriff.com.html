    <b class="header">RedSheriff Cares about Your Privacy</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    At RedSheriff, we know that providing us with your personal information is an act of trust - an act we take very seriously. 
    <p>
    This privacy policy covers:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> The information we collect<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Our use of your information<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> How to change or deactivate your information
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Our Value to Clients and Consumers</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    RedSheriff is a business intelligence company that delivers accurate and reliable interactive media and business intelligence for our clients. We provide insights and information that allow our clients to create more efficient and effective products and services to their customers. Through our efforts, our clients can provide richer, more personalized online experiences. 
    </p><p>
    We use the term "RedSheriff Client Web Sites" throughout this privacy policy to refer to the Web sites of our clients, but also to this RedSheriff Web site. You may be reading this privacy policy as a result of following a link from a RedSheriff Client Web Site.
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">The Information We Collect </b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    When you visit a RedSheriff Client Web Site, we may collect general information that will not personally identify you, such as:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Internet browser <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Operating system<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Date of visit<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Time of visit<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b class="header">·</b> Path taken through the site
    </p><p>
    This information alone does not identify an individual and we will not combine it with information that does identify you as an individual. It provides statistics that we use to analyze and improve RedSheriff Client Web Sites. Through this "Aggregate Statistical Data," we are able to gain insights and a greater understanding of how people use our client Web sites.
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    Personally identifiable information is defined as any personal information that could identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, billing and shipping information, credit card information, or e-mail address.
    </p><p>
    In general, when you visit a RedSheriff Client Web Site, you do not have to tell us who you are, or reveal any personally identifiable information. Because we take your privacy seriously, we will not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it.  At no time during your visit to a RedSheriff Client Web Site should you feel obligated to reveal any personal information to RedSheriff. 
    </p><p>
    At some RedSheriff Client Web Sites, a pop-up window may invite you to answer survey questions and provide certain demographic information, such as your age, sex, income bracket, country of access, and location of connection, (e.g., home or work). Response to these windows is voluntary. If you choose to provide your demographic information, another cookie will be set, which will link to your Unique Visitor Cookie. The result of these two sources of information is your "Site Usage Information". (For more information, see the section, <a href="#collect">"How We Collect Information"</a>.) 
    </p><p>
    In many cases, we will not ask for anything more than demographic information which does not identify you as an individual. However you will need to provide personal information in order to participate in certain promotions, receive product information, or buy products offered through RedSheriff Client Web Sites. In some cases we may seek personal information in order to verify whether you have already completed a survey or questionnaire. Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide a better understanding of your needs to our clients. We provide the personally identifiable information you have given us to our client only if you consent to us doing so. This information allows our client to perform various functions including, but not limited to, analyzing site usage (who has visited the site and what they are interested in), customizing the advertising and content seen by users, and improving marketing and promotional efforts. RedSheriff does not, however, make any representations whatsoever concerning the policies of its clients. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by RedSheriff. We encourage users to read the privacy statements of any Web site that collects personally identifiable information. RedSheriff is not responsible for the privacy practices of our clients. 
    </p><p>
    We may share your personal information with third party suppliers and service providers, including independent contractors providing services for, or with RedSheriff. In all cases, these third parties are contractually required to keep that information confidential. They are not authorized by RedSheriff to use that information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for, or with RedSheriff. We may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties if you consent to the disclosure, if we are compelled or authorized to do so by law, or if we reasonably believe there is a threat to someone's life or health. 
    </p><p>
    Personally identifiable information submitted for employment purposes will only be used in connection with the application process. It will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes unless required or authorized by law. 
    </p><p>
    <a name="collect"></a>
    <b class="header">How We Collect Information</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    We may use "cookies" to gather statistical information that helps us understand what you find interesting and useful on our client Web sites. These cookies are known as your "Unique Visitor Cookie" and identify you only by random number (e.g. #12489). You can decline our cookies by adjusting the "accept cookies" setting on your browser, however this may affect the functionality of RedSheriff Client Web Sites. 
    </p><p>
    We may also embed a piece of code into pages of certain client Web sites. This gives us statistical site usage information about the pages visited, duration of page view, location previous to accessing the RedSheriff Client Web Site, the navigational habits of user, and browser and operating system. We do not use this code to collect any personally identifiable information.
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Security and Storage of Information Collected</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    We are committed to maintaining the security of the data we collect and protecting it from loss, misuse, or alteration. This applies to demographic information, client site usage information, and personally identifiable information. We store the data collected on secure RedSheriff servers that can be accessed only by authorized RedSheriff personnel 
    </p><p>
    To safeguard all information collected, RedSheriff and all of its employees follow the practices in this policy. No one is permitted to access or use information for any purpose other than those explained in this policy.
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Changing and Deactivating Your Information</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    If you would like to change or deactivate the information you have submitted, please send a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@redsheriff.com">privacy@redsheriff.com</a>. RedSheriff will change or de-activate any information that could be used to identify you as soon as possible after your request, unless there we are required or authorized by law not to do so. Once de-activated your data will not be accessible, however due to limitations imposed by system backups to magnetic media, including the off site secure storage of data from our data warehouse your data can in some circumstances remain on these tapes. In the unlikely event that one of these tapes is accessed as part of a larger recovery of RedSheriff data, your data would continue to be flagged and remain de-activated and inaccessible for use by RedSheriff staff.
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    To fully protect your privacy, we reserve the right to amend this policy at any time, and for any reason. We will post the amended terms on this Web site as they occur and encourage you to frequently check for updates. This privacy policy was last amended on May 15, 2001. 
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">No Contract or Liability</b><br>
    <br style="font-size:6px;line-height:100%">
    Nothing contained in this policy is intended to create a contract or agreement between RedSheriff and any user providing identifiable information in any form, whether visiting this site or any RedSheriff client site. 
    </p><p>
    We will take all necessary steps to comply with this privacy policy, however, to the extent permitted by law, nothing in this policy is intended to hold RedSheriff liable for any failure to comply with this policy. 
    </p><p>
    Further, because RedSheriff does not control the privacy practices of our clients, we advise that you read and fully understand their privacy policies. 
    </p><p>
    <b class="header">Contact RedSheriff about this policy. </b><br>
