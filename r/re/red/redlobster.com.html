</p><p>This Privacy Notice describes the types of information we collect on the Service and Canadian Services (as applicable), how we may use the information, with whom we may share it and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information.  We also describe the measures we take to safeguard the information and tell you how to contact us about our privacy practices.

Information We Collect</strong></em></h2><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(a) Information About You That You Provide.</strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Personal Information and Demographic Information</strong>. &nbsp;On the Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number and home address (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about your gender, age, household income, employment status, nutritional preferences, and media preferences (“<strong>Demographic Information</strong>”). &nbsp;We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service, including registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with the Service. &nbsp;Except to the extent required by applicable law, Demographic Information is “<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>” (i.e., data that is not Personal Information under this Privacy Notice). In addition, Personal Information, including, without limitation, Personal Information Red Lobster collects directly from you on the Service (“<strong>Red Lobster-Collected PI</strong>”), once “de-identified” (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(b) Information Collected or Stored As You Access and Use the Service.</strong></p><p>Red Lobster, its Service Providers (defined below), and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device, each a “<strong>Device</strong>”). &nbsp;Except to the extent required by applicable law, or to the extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of Red Lobster with Red Lobster-Collected PI, Red Lobster does not consider Usage Information (including, without limitation, unique identifiers (“<strong>UIDs</strong>”)) to be Personal Information or Red Lobster-Collected PI. For more information on Third-Party Services and Service Providers’ data collection and practices, see Section 3 below. &nbsp;For information on choices some of these third parties may offer you regarding automated data collection, see Section 10 below.&nbsp;<br><br>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p><ul><li><strong>Log Information</strong>: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: &nbsp;Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. &nbsp;See Section 13 for a glossary of tracking technology terminology.</li></ul>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services, and used by Red Lobster and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. &nbsp;See Section 10 regarding certain choices regarding these activities. &nbsp;<br><br>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, Red Lobster currently does not alter Red Lobster’s practices when Red Lobster receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>, but Red Lobster is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. &nbsp;Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies, as more fully explained in Section 10. &nbsp;For Canadian Services see Section 7(b).<ul><p></p></ul><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You.</strong></p><p>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. &nbsp;Additionally, Red Lobster may, from time to time, also obtain information about you from other sources, including Service Providers and Third-Party Services, and combine that with Red Lobster-Collected PI for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except to the extent such data combined by or on behalf of Red Lobster with Red Lobster-Collected PI, this Privacy Notice is not intended to limit Red Lobster’s activities regarding such third-party-sourced, or non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information) and limitations on Red Lobster’s activities regarding Red Lobster Collected PI (e.g., on sharing) described in this Privacy Notice do not apply to such data. &nbsp;For Canadian Services, see Section 7(b).</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(d) Third-Party Content and Services.</strong></p><p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site, platform, tool, application or other service, and accessing or display of third-party content via the Service (“<strong>Third-Party Service(s)</strong>”). &nbsp;The use of Third-Party Services may involve the third-party operator thereof (“<strong>Third-Party Operator</strong>”) providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. &nbsp;For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. &nbsp;In addition, you may be able to access our Service, your account and/or Service content via a third party platform, site, app or other service, and those Third-Party Operators may collect Personal Information and other data about you in connection therewith, and may provide some or all of it to us.</p><p>If we offer and you choose to use Third-Party Services to access or use our Service, the Third-Party Services may send Personal Information about you to us. &nbsp;If we discontinue use of any Third-Party Service (e.g., your Facebook or any other account as an access mechanism for the Service), as permitted by applicable law you consent that we may nevertheless retain any Personal Information, and other information and data, we may have already received in connection therewith in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p><p>In addition, we may provide Third-Party Services’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. &nbsp;For example, we may use third parties to facilitate e-mails, tweets, “likes,” content submissions or postings of comments on Facebook or other social media platforms. &nbsp;We may also enable access to or display of third party content via the Service, that is actually being served or published by the third party, and such third party may be collecting data from you in connection with that content. &nbsp;These third parties may collect and retain any information used or provided in any such communications in accordance with their privacy policy. &nbsp;</p><p>When you use Third-Party Services, you are using the services of Third-Party Operators and not our Service and you should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such Third-Party Services in connection with our Service. &nbsp;For more information on Third-Party Services and the policies and activities of Third-Party Operators see Section 3. &nbsp;See Section 10 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>&nbsp;(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party.</strong></p><p>You may send someone else a communication from the Service, such as sending an invitation to a friend. &nbsp;If so, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. &nbsp;Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s). &nbsp;For such functionality through our Canadian Services, see also Section 7(b). &nbsp;Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies as further detailed in this Section 1 and Section 3.</p><h2><em><strong>2. How We Use The Information We Obtain</strong></em><br></h2><p>We may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information, Red Lobster-Collected PI or Usage Information that we collect about you: &nbsp;(1) to operate the Service, &nbsp;provide you with information, including sending you promotional materials (see Section 10 regarding communications options), or services or process transactions with you; (2) to improve the Services or create new service offerings, to customize your experience on any of the Services, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (3) to contact you with regard to your use of any of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to the any of the Services &nbsp;and/or any of the Services’ terms or policies; (4) for internal business purposes; and (5) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Notice or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law. &nbsp;Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, we may use the information we obtain through the Service to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Create and manage your account;</li><li>Customize your visits to the Service, including (i) specifically targeting relevant advertisements, offers or content to you; (ii) understanding the usefulness of the advertisements or content that have been delivered to you; (iii) allowing you to comment or add content to the Service; and (iv) using your location information to display offers or verify certain actions;</li><li>Process and collect payments for gift cards;</li><li>Analyze your purchase data and use it to credit your rewards account and to provide you with other offers or promotions;</li><li>Communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programs, surveys, contests, sweepstakes, and other offers or promotions;</li><li>Respond to and communicate with you about your requests, questions and comments;</li><li>Manage your application for employment with Red Lobster and contact you in connection with potential employment opportunities;&nbsp;</li><li>Process claims we receive in connection with our products and services;</li><li>Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; managing our communications; identifying users of our Service; determining the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and advertising; analyzing and enhancing our products, services and Service; and performing accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation and collection activities);&nbsp;</li><li>Administer the Service, and diagnose technical and service problems;</li><li>Perform data analyses and other processing (including market and consumer research, trend analysis, financial analysis, de-identification, encryption and tokenization of Personal Information);&nbsp;</li><li>Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities and harms; and</li><li>Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies.</li></ul><h2><em><strong>3. Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics</strong></em></h2><p>The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), Third-Party Service(s) as more fully described in Section 1(d).

Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Service, and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features and functionalities of the Service may not work. &nbsp;A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file which may be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. &nbsp;HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and HTML 5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in the browser and browser settings won’t control them. &nbsp;To identify certain types of local shared objects on your computer and adjust your settings, please visit: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. &nbsp;The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(b) Device Recognition Technologies.</strong></p><p>Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household).</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(c) Embedded Scripts. </strong></p><p>An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from Red Lobster’s web server, or from a third party with which Red Lobster works, and is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(d) Fingerprinting.</strong></p><p>Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or tracking.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(e) In-App Tracking Methods.</strong></p><p>There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. &nbsp;Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(f) Location-identifying Technologies. </strong></p><p>PS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) your device for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location.</p><p style="margin-left:30px;"><strong>(g) Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”). </strong></p><p>Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.</p>
