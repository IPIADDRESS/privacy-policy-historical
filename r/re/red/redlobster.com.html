In addition, Personal Information, including, without limitation, Personal Information Red Lobster collects directly from you on the Service (“<strong>Red Lobster-Collected PI</strong>”), once “de-identified” (i.e., the removal of personal identifiers from data to make it no longer personally identifiable) is also non-Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law.&nbsp;</p></li><li><h3><strong>Information Collected or Stored As You Access and Use the Service.</strong></h3><br><p>Red Lobster, its Service Providers (defined below), and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, information about your use of the Service, and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device, each a “<strong>Device</strong>”). &nbsp;Except to the extent required by applicable law, or to the extent Usage Information is combined by or on behalf of Red Lobster with Red Lobster-Collected PI, Red Lobster does not consider Usage Information (including, without limitation, unique identifiers (“<strong>UIDs</strong>”)) to be Personal Information or Red Lobster-Collected PI. For more information on Third-Party Services and Service Providers’ data collection and practices, see Section 3 below. &nbsp;For information on choices some of these third parties may offer you regarding automated data collection, see Section 10 below.&nbsp;<br><br>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p><ul><li><strong>Log Information</strong>: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: &nbsp;Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. &nbsp;See Section 13 for a glossary of tracking technology terminology.</li></ul><p>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third-Party Services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services, and used by Red Lobster and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third-Party Services. &nbsp;See Section 10 regarding certain choices regarding these activities.</p><p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many online services, Red Lobster currently does not alter Red Lobster’s practices when Red Lobster receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutdnt.com<span class="show-for-sr"> Opens in a new Window</span></a>, but Red Lobster is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. &nbsp;Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies, as more fully explained in Section 10. &nbsp;For Canadian Services see Section 7(b).</p></li><li><h3><strong>Information Third Parties Provide About You.</strong></h3><br><p>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. &nbsp;Additionally, Red Lobster may, from time to time, also obtain information about you from other sources, including Service Providers and Third-Party Services, and combine that with Red Lobster-Collected PI for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you. &nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except to the extent such data combined by or on behalf of Red Lobster with Red Lobster-Collected PI, this Privacy Notice is not intended to limit Red Lobster’s activities regarding such third-party-sourced, or non-Service-sourced, information (including Personal Information) and limitations on Red Lobster’s activities regarding Red Lobster Collected PI (e.g., on sharing) described in this Privacy Notice do not apply to such data. &nbsp;For Canadian Services, see Section 7(b).</p></li><li><h3><strong>Third-Party Content and Services.</strong></h3><br><p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site, platform, tool, application or other service, and accessing or display of third-party content via the Service (“<strong>Third-Party Service(s)</strong>”). &nbsp;The

log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. &nbsp;In addition, you may be able to access our Service, your account and/or Service content via a third party platform, site, app or other service, and those Third-Party Operators may collect Personal Information and other data about you in connection therewith, and may provide some or all of it to us.</p><p>If we offer and you choose to use Third-Party Services to access or use our Service, the Third-Party Services may send Personal Information about you to us. &nbsp;If we discontinue use of any Third-Party Service (e.g., your Facebook or any other account as an access mechanism for the Service), as permitted by applicable law you consent that we may nevertheless retain any Personal Information, and other information and data, we may have already received in connection therewith in accordance with this Privacy Notice.</p><p>In addition, we may provide Third-Party Services’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. &nbsp;For example, we may use third parties to facilitate e-mails, tweets, “likes,” content submissions or postings of comments on Facebook or other social media platforms. &nbsp;We may also enable access to or display of third party content via the Service, that is actually being served or published by the third party, and such third party may be collecting data from you in connection with that content. &nbsp;These third parties may collect and retain any information used or provided in any such communications in accordance with their privacy policy. &nbsp;</p><p>When you use Third-Party Services, you are using the services of Third-Party Operators and not our Service and you should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such Third-Party Services in connection with our Service. &nbsp;For more information on Third-Party Services and the policies and activities of Third-Party Operators see Section 3. &nbsp;See Section 10 for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use.</p></li><li><h3><strong>Information You Provide About a Third Party.</strong></h3><br><p>You may send someone else a communication from the Service, such as sending an invitation to a friend. &nbsp;If so, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. &nbsp;Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s). &nbsp;For such functionality through our Canadian Services, see also Section 7(b). &nbsp;Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies as further detailed in this Section 1 and Section 3.</p></li></ol></li><li><h2 id="how-we-use-the-Information-we-obtain"><em><strong>How We Use The Information We Obtain</strong></em><br></h2><p>We may use your Personal

Advertising and Analytics</strong></em></h2><p>The Service may include hyperlinks to, or include on or in connection with, the Service (e.g., apps and plug-ins), Third-Party Service(s) as more fully described in Section 1(d). For example, if you “click” on a link, the “click” may take you off the Service onto a different site. &nbsp;We encourage you to note when you leave our Service. &nbsp;The Third-Party Operators of these Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. &nbsp;When you use Third-Party Services, you are using their services and not our Service and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. &nbsp;You should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such Third-Party Services in connection with our Service, including before submitting any Personal Information to such Third-Party Services.&nbsp;</p><p>Certain functionalities on the Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third party social networks (“<strong>Social Features</strong>”). &nbsp;Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Service and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” Red Lobster’s content; logging in to the Service using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Service); and to otherwise connect the Service to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Service). &nbsp;If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (see Section 5) or by the Third-Party Service that you use as permitted by applicable law. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Red Lobster in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or otherwise by Red Lobster. &nbsp;Also, both Red Lobster and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.&nbsp;</p><p>Red Lobster may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Service and/or on third-party services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and elsewhere on the Internet, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising” (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Service (i.e., “retargeting”).

under this Privacy Notice. &nbsp;Otherwise, the information collected, stored, and shared by third parties remains subject to their privacy policies and practices, including whether they continue to

rights applicable to all Personal Information collected by us in connection with our Canadian Services.</p><p>Red Lobster is not responsible for and makes no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Service Providers and Third-Party Services associated with the Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself
