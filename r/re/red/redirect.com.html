<p>
    We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of your personal
    information, and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to provide you with
    important information about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy
    applies when you use a website, mobile or tablet application, or other
    online service (collectively, the "Services") that links or refers to it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>If you are a user in the European Economic Area</strong>
("EEA") or Switzerland, please see the    <a href="#eea"><strong>Users in the EEA and Switzerland</strong></a> section of this Privacy
    Policy for additional provisions that are applicable to your use of the
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Information We Collect</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may collect personal information about our users in various ways. For
    example, we may collect information that you provide to us, information
    that we collect through your use of the Services, and information that we
    collect from publicly available sources or third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information You Provide to Us. </strong>
    When you register or otherwise interact with the Services, you may be
    invited to provide personal information to enhance your experience on the
    Services. For example, during account registration, we may ask for
    information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender,
    street address, job title and industry and related information. We may
    collect payment information, such as your credit card number and expiration
    date, where appropriate to process a financial transaction you have
    requested.
</p>
<p>
    We also collect information that you provide us when you comment on
    articles, participate in message boards, and submit images, photos, videos,
    or other content to the Services. We may ask you for additional information
    at other times, such as when you enter a contest or participate in a
    promotion, when you post an online ad, or when you order products from us
    or otherwise engage with the Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information About Your Use of the Services. </strong>
    In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may collect
    information about your use of the Services. For example, we may collect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Device information</em>
        - such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device
        identifiers, operating system version, browser type and settings, such
        as language and available font settings, and settings of the device you
        use to access the Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Usage information</em>
        - such as information about the Services you use, the time and duration
        of your use of the Services and other information about your
        interaction with content offered through a Service, and any information
        stored using cookies, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies
        that we have set on your device. For detailed information about our use
of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, see the        <strong>Online Tracking and Advertising</strong> section below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Location information</em>
        - such as your computer's IP address, your mobile device's GPS signal
        or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that
        may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information From Third-Party Sources. </strong>
    We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially
    available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other
    information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive
    information about you from a social media site if you connect to the
    Services through that site.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other Information We Collect. </strong>
    We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use
    of the services in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection
    or otherwise with your consent. You may choose not to provide us with
    certain types of information but doing so may affect your ability to use
    some of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children
    under the age of 13 (a "Minor"). The Website is not directed to Minors. If
    we obtain actual knowledge that we collected personal information about a
    Minor, that information will be automatically deleted from our database.
    Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to
    use or to disclose to Third Parties. We have designed this policy in order
    to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). You
may read more about COPPA at    <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.coppa.org</a>.
    If you become aware that your child, a Minor, has provided us with personal
    information without your consent, you should contact us immediately.
</p>

    <strong>Affiliates.</strong>
    We may share information within our family of affiliated companies and
    other companies that might be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Business Partners.</strong>
    We may also share your information with business partners to provide you
    with services that you request. For example, if you sign up for a promotion
    that runs on our Services but that is sponsored or co-sponsored by another
    company, your information may be shared with that sponsor. We are not
    responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.
</p>

    We may share information with vendors providing contractual services to us,
    such as hosting vendors, advertising service providers, and list managers.

    appropriate to process your payments for the Services or complete a
    transaction.

<p>
    <strong>
        Other Parties When Required by Law or As Necessary to Protect Our Users
        and Services.
    </strong>
    We may share your personal information as we believe is necessary or
    appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy,
    safety, or property of the Services, our employees or agents or users or to
    comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to
    requests from public and government authorities.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Logging In Through Social Media Services. </strong>
    If you log into the Services with a social media service or if you connect
    a social media account with the Services, we may share your information
    with that social media service. The social media services' use of the
    shared information will be governed by the social media services' privacy
    policy and your social media account settings. If you do not want your
    information shared in this way, do not connect your social media service
    account with your Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising, or Functionality.
    </strong>
    When you use our Services, third parties may collect or receive certain
    information about you and/or your use of the Services (<em>e.g.</em>,
    hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date,
    information about your interactions with advertisements and other content),
    including through the use of cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and
    similar technologies, in order to provide content, advertising, or
    functionality or to measure and analyze ad performance, on our Services or
    other websites or platforms. This information may be combined with
    information collected across different websites, online services, and other
    linked or associated devices. These third parties may use your information
    to improve their own services and consistent with their own privacy
    policies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction. </strong>
    We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the
    event that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets
    to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in
    connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Otherwise With Your Consent or At Your Direction. </strong>
    In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share
    information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct
    such sharing. We also may share other information with third parties in a
    manner that does not identify particular users, including, for example,
    aggregated data about how users are using our Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Disputes. </strong>
    If you have any concerns or claims with respect to our data handling
    practices, please contact us first. We will investigate and attempt to
    resolve any complaints and disputes regarding our use and disclosure of
    your Individual Information. If your complaint or dispute cannot be
    resolved through our internal process, or if we do not adequately respond
    to your question, you agree to resolve your dispute through arbitration. If
    arbitration is necessary, it will be conducted by telephone and email, and
    if it must be done in person, it will be conducted in Denver, Colorado. The
    arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator member of the American
    Arbitration Association, and under the rules of commercial arbitration of
    the American Arbitration Association or as agreed between you and the
    Company. Both parties will bear equally the cost of arbitration (exclusive
    of legal fees and expenses). You acknowledge and agree that you and the
    Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as
    a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit,
    class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other
    representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the Company
    otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
    one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
    class or representative proceeding. All decisions of the arbitrator will be
    final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent
jurisdiction. For additional information you may contact    <a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.ADR.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Limitation of Liability. </strong>
    We exercise reasonable efforts to safeguard the security and
    confidentiality of your personal information; however, transmissions
    protected by industry standard technology and administered by humans cannot
    be guaranteed to be secure. We will not be liable for unauthorized
    disclosure of personal information that occurs through no fault of our own
    including, but not limited to, errors in transmission, access to your
    account by anyone, uses of your Member ID and password by a third party,
    your failure to comply with your security obligations, and the unauthorized
    acts of our employees.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your California Privacy Rights. </strong>
    (a) California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to
    request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of
    certain categories of personal information to third parties for their
    direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. We do not share
    personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing
    purposes. (b) California residents who are registered users of the Services
    and are under the age of 18 are entitled, in accordance with California
    law, to request and obtain removal of content and information that they
    themselves post on the Services. You may request such removal by emailing

    <strong><em>Data Security</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect
    the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures
    are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security
    of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will
    not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Other Important Information</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Children's Privacy.</strong>
    We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under
    the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we
    learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal
    information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

<p>
    <strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. </strong>
    Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with
    which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers
    incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users
    intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware
    of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what,
    if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the
    Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and
    when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to
    respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see Online Tracking &amp;
    Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be
    available to you with respect to targeted advertising.

            How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How
            To Disable These Technologies
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or
    measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web
    beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate
    administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve
    our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here
    or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookies.</strong>
    Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a
    website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied
    to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user
    across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies
    serve many useful purposes. For example:
</p>
<p>
    · Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter
    those credentials each time you visit a Service
</p>
<p>
    · Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our
    Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and
    features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By
    studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services
    and provide you with a better experience.
</p>
<p>
    · Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so
    that you don't receive the same ad each time you access a Service.
</p>
<p>
    Most browsers accept cookies automatically but can be configured not to do
    so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to
    disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable
    cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere
    with the proper functioning of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Beacons.</strong>
    We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or
    "pixels") that communicate information from your device to a server.
    Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can
    allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know
    when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message,
    determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP
    address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of
    purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction
    with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your IP Address. </strong>
    We, along with third parties, may use your IP Address to determine your
    location, ISP ("Internet Service Provider"), and internet connection type.
    We may use this information for ad targeting as well as to protect our
    network from fraudulent activity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HTTP Headers. </strong>
    We, along with third parties, may use the HTTP Headers provided by your
    device/web browser in order to determine what web browser you are using,
    the operating system you are using, your preferred language, and if you are
    accessing our services behind a proxy. We may use this information for ad
    targeting as well as to protect our network from fraudulent activity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Local Storage &amp; Other Tracking Technologies. </strong>
    We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as
    Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local
    storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique
    identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers.
    These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they
    are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information
    about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make
    use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you
    might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and
    settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary
    depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling
    or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found

        <em>Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking
    technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these
    technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular
    advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before
    and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about
    certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the
    <u>
        <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance </a>
    </u>
    website.
</p>
<a name="eea"></a>
<p>
    Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you
    may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in
    mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted
    advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or
    your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile
    settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall
    process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.
