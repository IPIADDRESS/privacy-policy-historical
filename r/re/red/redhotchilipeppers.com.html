	wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally
	Identifiable Information (as defined below).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Policy</strong>")
	describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information
	that we collect through<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>certain
	of our web sites, including the site from which you are linking to this Policy</strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b>&nbsp;</b></span>(the "<strong>Site</strong>").&nbsp;
	This Policy does not govern our collection of information through any web site,
	or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this Policy govern
	the collection of information by any of our affiliates, or by third
	parties.&nbsp; To the extent that you submit any Personally Identifiable Information
	to any third party (for example, via a third-party software application or
	service that is available through or included in the Site), such third party's
	collection, use and disclosure of such information may be governed by its
	privacy policy, and not by our Policy (in any event, we are not responsible for
	the information collection, usage and disclosure practices of third parties).</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><span>By using
	the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy.&nbsp; If you do
	not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the
	Site.&nbsp; We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior
	notice.&nbsp; You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring
	to the "<em><span>LAST UPDATED</span></em>"
	legend at the top of this page.&nbsp; Any changes to our Policy will become
	effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site.&nbsp; Use of the
	Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy
	then in effect.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><span>The Site
	is controlled and operated by Company from the United States; accordingly, this
	Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable
	Information, is governed by U.S. law, and not by the laws of any country,
	territory or jurisdiction other than that of the United States.&nbsp; Company does
	not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or
	available for use in any particular jurisdiction.&nbsp; Those who choose to
	access the Site<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="grame">do</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>so on their
	own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all
	local laws, rules and regulations.&nbsp; You are also subject to United States
	export controls in connection with your use of the Site and/or Site-related
	services, and are responsible for any violations of such controls, including
	without limitation any United States embargoes or other federal rules and
	regulations restricting exports.&nbsp; We may limit the Site's availability, in
	whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at
	any time and in our sole discretion.&nbsp; By using the Site and submitting any
	Personally Identifiable Information, visitors from outside of the United States
	acknowledge that the Site is subject to United States law and consent to the
	transfer of Personally Identifiable Information to the United States, which may
	provide a different level of data security than in their country of residence,
	and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>Note
	Regarding the Use of the Site by Children:</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen
	(13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally
	Identifiable Information through the Site.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	What Types of Information Does Company Collect From Me?&nbsp;</span></strong><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><span>Company
	gathers two basic types of information through the Site: "<strong>Personally
	Identifiable Information</strong>" (or "<strong>PII</strong>")
	and "<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>" (or
	"<strong>Non-PII</strong>").&nbsp; Personally Identifiable
	Information is information that identifies you as an individual; that is, your
	name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or
	other payment account number.&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information is
	aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other
	information that does not reveal your specific identity.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally Identifiable
	Information.&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>You do not have to provide PII
	to use the Site.&nbsp; However, in order for you to take advantage of
	particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to sign up for
	a newsletter or to view certain areas of the Site), we may require that you
	furnish PII.&nbsp; We collect PII from you through the Site only when you
	voluntarily provide it to us.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable
	Information.&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>When you visit and interact
	with the Site, Company and third parties with whom Company has contracted to
	provide services to Company may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the
	Site pages you visit).&nbsp; Non-PII is generally collected through the Site
	from five different sources:&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="grame">server log</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>files,
	environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and
	information that you voluntarily provide.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Server Log Files.&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>Your Internet Protocol (IP)
	address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are
	using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; This number is identified
	and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site,
	along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.&nbsp;
	We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as
	calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's
	servers, and administering the Site.&nbsp; Collecting IP addresses is standard
	practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Environmental Variables.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="grame">We and our service providers</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>may also collect certain environmental
	variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh),
	screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser
	version.&nbsp; These environmental variables are collected by most browsers,
	and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Cookies.&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span class="grame"><span>We
	and our service providers</span></span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>may use "cookies" on the
	Site.&nbsp; Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's
	computer for recordkeeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies are an industry standard
	used by most web sites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of
	a particular web site; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or
	files.&nbsp; If you do not want information collected through the use of
	cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to
	automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or
	accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web
	site, to your computer.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Pixel Tags.&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>We and our service providers
	may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons,"
	"clear<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="spelle">GIFs</span>"
	or similar means (collectively, "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") in
	connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among
	other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response
	rates.&nbsp; A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1),
	that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with
	Cookies on the visitors' hard drives.&nbsp; Pixel Tags allow us to count users
	who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to
	help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.&nbsp;
	When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender
	whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><strong><span>Flash Local Stored Objects.</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>We and our service providers may use a third-party technology,
	called Flash, in connection with the Site or our online content. Flash provides
	a facility, referred to as Local Stored Objects ("LSO"), that allows
	a web site operator or online content provider, or their service providers, to
	store certain information locally on an individual's computer; for example, Flash
	LSOs can be used to store information regarding an individual's computer.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><span>If you do
	not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of
	your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using
	the<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>Website Storage Settings Panel</span></span></span></span><span>. You can also control Flash LSOs
	by going to the<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>Global Storage Settings Panel</span></span></span></span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>and following the instructions (which may include instructions
	that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as
	"information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
	being placed on your computer without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
	and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator
	of the page you are on at the time).</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><span>Please
	note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash
	LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications,
	including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or
	our online content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to
	honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot
	guarantee that they will do so.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

	<p><strong><span>vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span class="apple-converted-space"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><strong><span>Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Company also collects
	Non-PII (<em>e.g.</em>, your interests, your geographic location, etc.) when
	you voluntarily provide such information to us.&nbsp; When such information is
	not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it
	does not personally identify you or any other user.&nbsp; Additionally, we may
	aggregate PII in a manner such that the<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><span class="grame">end-product</span><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>does
	not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by
	using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular
	artist.&nbsp; Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of
	this Policy.</span><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>
