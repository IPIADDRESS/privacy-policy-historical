<h2>Your IP Address</h2>
<p>Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page from which you came. We use this information to administer and optimize the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site. We use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. </p>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>In some cases, we will collect information from you that can be used to identify you personally, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, purchase history, and credit card number ("Personal Information"). We collect Personal Information when you sign up to receive newsletters, create a personalized fan homepage, request information regarding an event we sponsor, enter games, contests or sweepstakes, open an account, purchase tickets or products, join a mailing list, and otherwise as needed to fulfill your requests for information, products, and services. You will know when we collect this information because in each instance you will submit it to us voluntarily in order to open your account or receive the information, product, or service you request. </p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, the Site uses a software technology called "cookies" to collect non-personally identifiable information. Cookies contain information that we may place on your computer to help personalize your experience at the Site and to keep track of your user name and password so you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit the Site. We also use  cookies to collect information about the pages that you visit at our Site in a given session of use, and may also use them to keep track of where you left off in a game.  This information is then retained in a database, which we use to better satisfy your needs and those of other visitors.  Except with respect to our e-commerce activities (e.g., on-line purchases), we do not link the non-personally identifiable information in cookies with personally identifiable information about you. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place cookies on your browser to gather information; they use your information in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control.  If you wish to disable cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the Site. </p>
<h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
<p>We use your Personal Information for our internal purposes, such as maintaining the Site and fulfilling your requests for products, services, and information. For example, we will contact you when necessary in connection with events for which you purchased tickets on the Site (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations). We also use your Personal Information to send you information, offers and other promotional materials from us and selected third parties. We carefully select the information we send to you and attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. We provide you with the option of declining to receive offers from us by "opting-out" of receipt of this type of communication. Generally, we will not send you communications on behalf of third parties unless we add our redhotchilipeppers.com  brand to those communications. 
</p>
<h2>Product Support for Our Visitors</h2>
<p>Please send an email to support@redhotchilipeppers.com should you need help with a technical problem relating to this Site.  To respond to your problem, we may ask you to provide your first name and email address.  We will use the information for no other purpose and it will be deleted as soon as the problem has been resolved.</p>
<h2>Forwarding Web Pages</h2>
<p>If we provide you with the opportunity to email a web page to another person, we will need to collect your email address and the email address of those to whom you send the page. We will use the email addresses collected this way for no other purpose except to send the web page, and the addresses will be deleted once the page has been sent.
</p>
<h2>When We Share Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We share your Personal Information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions, order fulfillment and game, contest, sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment. We do not authorize these entities to use your information for any other purpose. If you purchase tickets on the Site, we will share your Personal Information with the venues, promoters, artists and other third parties associated with the concerts and events for which you purchase tickets ("Event Partners"). Due to our contractual obligations with Event Partners, we cannot offer you the opportunity to opt-out of our sharing of your Personal Information with them. 

We may select certain third parties with whom we will share your Personal Information so that they can communicate directly with you about their products and services. We attempt to carefully select these third parties and the specific offers they intend to communicate to you so that you will receive high quality, valuable and relevant offers. We generally do not authorize third parties (except our Event Partners) to communicate with you without adding our RedHotChiliPeppers.com brand to the communication. The Site provides you with the option of declining to have your Personal Information shared with these selected third parties. 

We will also provide your Personal Information to a third party if you purchase products or services offered by third parties on the Site (such as magazine subscriptions). 

Your Personal Information may be shared with a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or a bankruptcy of RedHotChiliPeppers.com. We may also disclose your Personal Information as required or permitted by law, to protect the interests or safety of RedHotChiliPeppers.com or a third party, or to prevent an emergency. 

Any third party with whom we share your Personal Information is authorized to use your Personal Information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control. Those who contact you will need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your Personal Information by them. 

</p>
<h2>Games, Contests, Sweepstakes and Certain Promotions</h2>
<p>Should we or our business partners sponsor online games, contests or sweepstakes, or certain promotions, the specific rules and regulations will vary. Your participation will constitute your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations. We will use the information you provide when we fulfill a prize. If you reside in the United States and are older than 12 but younger than 18 years of age, we will ask you for information to contact your parent or guardian at the time of registration, and if you win, he or she will be sent an e-mail with information about the game, contest, sweepstakes or promotion in question and about your award. Your parent or guardian will then have a chance to "opt out" of collecting your prize on your behalf, in which case the prize will not be awarded.  Persons who are not residents of the United States and under the age of 18 are not eligible to make use of our site, and accordingly, they cannot participate in games, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions.  (See above.)</p>

When you purchase products or services of third parties (such as magazine subscriptions) offered on the Site, we will provide your financial information (including credit card transactions) to those third parties.
