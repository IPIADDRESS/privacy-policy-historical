</font></span><font color="#414141" face="Tahoma" size="2">This website (the "www.RedZee.com")
is owned and operated by ISE Corp. ISE Corp (collectively, "ISE" or "we") are
committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for
appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information
("Personal Information") you share with us. ISE has established this Privacy
Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the Site and
how we may use that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our
Privacy Policy. By using the Site (including ISE's “RedZee” search engine and
any other services offered on the Site), you agree to accept the terms of our
Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please
do not use the site or our services. This Privacy Policy applies only to
information that we collect on the site (or otherwise through our search engine)
and does not apply to information which we may collect by other
means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#414141" face="Tahoma" size="2">

<br>
Personal Information Information We May Collect<br>
<br>
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an
individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or
other physical address and an email address. In general, you can visit the Site
and use its search engine and other features without telling us who you are or
revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, in order to access
certain information, services or features contained on the Site, we may require
you to provide Personal Information. For example, we will collect certain
Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to our mailing list or send
questions or comments to us via e-mail.<br>
<br>
How We May Use Your Information<br>
<br>
Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A
cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual's hard
drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be used, for example, to collect
information about website activity. Most browsers allow you to control cookies,
including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most
browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block
cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the
Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may
occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links
on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies
sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. We do not link
the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information
you submit while on our site.<br>
<br>
Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host
names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system
types; click stream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed. We
do not link the information we record using tracking technologies to any
personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.<br>
<br>
Search Engine<br>
<br>
When you use our search engine, we may collect certain non-personally
identifiable information through the use of cookies and other tracking
technologies described above. For example, when you use our search engine, we
may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we display advertising to
you on the Site (including the search results pages displayed after any searches
you may run), such advertising may be related to the search terms you entered.
ISE may present search result links in a format that enables us to understand
whether they have been followed and may monitor click-throughs on an individual
and an aggregate basis. We use this information to understand and improve the
quality of ISE's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine
how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often
they proceed to later results.<br>
<br>
Certain search results may be "sponsored" results, which consist of websites who
have paid for placement in the search results. These listings are provided by
our business partner, Link Positions, which is a subsidiary of ISE. These
premium results may contain tracking URLs provided by Link Positions to identify
clicks from the search results page. Again, information gathered by these means
will not personally identify you. Any information collected by Link Positions
will be subject to Link Positions's privacy policy, and Link Positions and ISE
may share information that either company gathers in connection with the use of
ISE's search engine.<br>
<br>
Links to Other Sites<br>
<br>
Please be aware that when you are on the site, you could be directed to other
sites that are beyond our control. For example, when you use our search engine,
the search results will provide links to other sites from the Site's pages that
take you outside the Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to
visitors, collect data or solicit Personal Information. The privacy policies of
these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy Policy. We
are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot
guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected there.<br>
<br>
Security<br>
<br>
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within ISE or on its behalf, we
intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal
Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information
and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you
disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft,
destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.<br>
<br>
Updating Your Information<br>
<br>
To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, ISE wishes to
maintain accurate Personal Information. If we collect Personal Information from
you on the Web, you may send updates and corrections about your Personal
Information to privacy@RedZee.com and we will make reasonable efforts to
incorporate the changes in your Personal Information that we hold as soon as
practicable.<br>
<br>
Children's Privacy<br>
<br>
Redzee.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not
knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If you
are under the age of 13, please do not provide any Personal Information to us.<br>
<br>
Changes to Our Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time without prior
notice to you, so please check this page periodically for any changes. By
checking the "Last Modified" date above, you can determine if this Privacy
Policy has been updated since your last visit to the Site. Your continued use of
the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes.<br>
<br>
Governing Law<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of ISE will be subject exclusively
to the laws of the State of Florida within the United States of America. ISE
makes no representation that this Privacy Policy and such practices comply with
the laws of any other country. Visitors who use the Site, the search engine or
any other services offered on the Site and reside outside the United States do
so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws,
if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</font><br>
