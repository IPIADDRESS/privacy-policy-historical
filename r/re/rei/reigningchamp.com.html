		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Unsubscribe from our newsletter</h3>

<p>If you wish to unsubscribe from our subscriber list, simply
click on the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of each
newsletter you received and your email will be promptly taken off
from our newsletter system.</p>

<p>CYC Design Corporation ("CYC"), which owns the Reigning Champ
brand, shares a strict policy with respect to maintaining the
privacy of subscribers to all Reigning Champ special offers, blogs
and information services. This Privacy Policy outlines what
specific information is gathered on the company's main website and
related websites, and how that information is used. Maintaining the
privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it
helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with
our customers and industry partners. If, at any time, you have
questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free
contact <a href="mailto:info@reigningchamp.com">info@reigningchamp.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>CYC explicitly asks when we need information that personally
identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your personal information
is used to create your personal record for the purposes of
communicating, distributing email, news alerts and/or traditional
mail. Demographic and profile data collected by CYC may be used to
tailor this web site or any requested email communications, and to
display information that is more relevant to you. Under no
circumstances will CYC make any personal information about an
individual user available to anyone. Your email address is used to
only send you information that you have requested by subscribing to
the posted information service(s). CYC allows you to elect to
receive, or not receive, certain information from CYC. CYC adheres
strictly to a permission-based email policy. Except as mentioned
above, CYC will not send you unsolicited email information,
commercial offers or advertisements. CYC will not sell, rent, or
loan our contact lists or our news and/or information subscriber
contact lists to any outside firms. All emails that you have
requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests
are fulfilled within minutes and no further communications will be
sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the
specified information.</p>

<h3>Communications from the Company</h3>

<p>We send all new subscribers a welcoming email to verify their
email address. Subscribers will occasionally receive information on
reigning Champ and other CYC apparel brands, offers, announcements,
events, information delivery services, important news, and company
newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of subscribers, we
present the option to not receive these types of communications.
Users can unsubscribe via the unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom
of each email. Also, from time to time, we may include in our own
email notices or newsletters, news, offers or announcements by one
of our partners in business, but we would never, under any
circumstances, share all or part of your contact information with a
third party.</p>

<h3>E-News &amp; Mobil Alerts</h3>

<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to one or more of our email or
Mobil Alert services, we ask for contact information such as name
and email address, and when a Mobil Alert is subscribed to, for a
SMS-capable telephone number. Out of respect for our users privacy
we provide a way to opt-out of these communications via the
unsubscribe mechanism at the bottom of each email.</p>

<h3>Website Usage</h3>

<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
server, and to administer our Web site. We do not link your IP
address to any personally identifiable information. We use tracking
information to determine which areas our site users visit based on
traffic to those areas. CYC does not track what individual users
read, but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us
maintain a superior and informative website for you.</p>

<h3>Security Technology</h3>

<p>CYC has adopted the latest server, database, backup and firewall
technologies to protect our information assets. These technologies
are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture. All
data resides in a tightly controlled, secure hosted data center.
These protocols mean that information about the identity and
preferences of individual subscribers is never accessible to anyone
outside CYC and its contracted website and mail administration and
hosting partners. We are committed to maintaining the security of
your personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Policy Modifications</h3>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when CYC
makes changes to this privacy statement, we will highlight the
changes on our homepage and/or email users who have given us
permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to
check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the
Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal
information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a
manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy,
without your prior consent.</p>

<h3>Correct Errors In Your Information?</h3>

<p>You can access and correct errors in your personally
identifiable information by contacting us as indicated below. While
CYC uses reasonable efforts to ensure that the information we hold
about you is accurate, complete and current, we rely on you to
inform us about changes to your contact or other relevant
information.</p>

<h3>Contacting Us About Privacy</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about our privacy statement, the
information we have collected from you online, the practices of
this site, or your dealings with this web site, please contact: <a href="mailto:info@reigningchamp.com" title="email us a ReigningChamp.com">info@reigningchamp.com</a></p>
