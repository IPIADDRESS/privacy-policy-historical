                        <h2>HOW DOES THOMSON REUTERS PROTECT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS?</h2>

                        <p>
                            We have implemented certain appropriate security measures to help protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, some of your network communications when you use Reuters TV are protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology which protects against eavesdroppers by using encryption. Also, we store Personal Information in a data center with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus protection software. <b>However, please note that we do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside of your home country, including countries located outside of the European Union. However, regardless of where storage and processing may occur, we take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is protected, consistent with the principles set forth under this statement.  By using this application you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as described in this privacy statement.
                        </p>

                        <h2>WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

                        <p>
                            We will not sell, rent, or lease mailing lists or your Personal Information to others, and we will not make your Personal Information available to any unaffiliated parties, except as follows:</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                As required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another company or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will not disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties, except as necessary to service the account, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our obligations to content and technology providers, or as required by law.
