        and tools from one site to another, this policy states Reunion.com’s 
        company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices.<br>
        <br>

        <font color="#333399"><b>Overview of Our Policy</b></font><br>
        The security of your personal information is a high priority at 
        Reunion.com. We maintain these web sites and all associated data with 
        technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against 
        loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and 
        improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully 
        protected against every possible hazard, but Reunion.com is committed to

        message boards, or people search, that information can be viewed and 
        possibly used by others, both on the Reunion.com Sites and potentially 
        on our Partners’ sites. We advise users not to disclose contact information, 
        including phone number, email address, street address or instant 
        messenger address ("Personally Identifiable information") within these 
        public areas that they do not wish to share.&nbsp; This information 
        should instead be maintained in the appropriate email and contact 
        information section of this site, which is protected under the terms of 
        this privacy policy. <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#333399"><b>Changes to this Policy</b></font><br>
        This Privacy Policy is available to users on this page for you to read. 
        This Privacy Policy may be updated and modified from time to time to

        by a notice on the home pages of the Reunion.com Sites of any 
        significant update to our Privacy Policy. By registering as a member of

        <br>
        <font color="#333399"><b>Information Collection and Use</b></font><br>
        Below are more details about the information the Reunion.com Sites 
        gather from you and how we use it.<br>
        <br>
        <b>A. Email Newsletters and Updates.</b> Reunion.com Sites offer email 
        newsletters and important account activity updates. Only registered 
        users will be able to receive these updates. We will only send you the 
        update(s) that you signed up for. If you want to update your email 
        address or stop receiving our newsletter, follow the procedures at the 
        bottom of any newsletter or update we send you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>B. Membership Registration Information.</b> When you register for 
        membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you and 
        your interests. We do this so we can better understand what you like and 
        tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, 
        birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you 
        volunteer, the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to 
        your interests. We may engage third parties to perform analysis or data 
        processing of our databases that involves access to this information in 
        order to better provide you with the services for which you joined (in 
        which case we will take measures to ensure that such parties are 
        contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to 
        use it other than in a manner that is necessary to perform their work 
        for Reunion.com). <br>
        <br>
        We may also use or disclose your membership registration or other 
        Personally Identifiable Information as follows:</font><blockquote>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">• <b>Service Providers.</b> We also 
          sometimes offer our members other services provided by third parties. 
          When you register for membership on a Reunion.com Site or activate a 
          service by clicking on a particular service link (e.g., email) on our 
          sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free 
          services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information 
          may be shared by Reunion.com with those third-party service providers. 
          By becoming a member of the offered service you authorize us and our third-party service 
          providers to send you email updates and information about promotions 
          and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party 
          service providers only use our member’s data as necessary to provide 
          the particular service requested and to give you updates on that 
          service provider’s products and services. <br>
          <br>
          • <b>Co-registration with Other Sites. </b>As a member, we may offer 
          you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. 
          In some instances where Reunion.com provides co-registration, the 
          co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If 
          you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of 
          service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their 
          select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is 
          shared with those organizations. As a result, you may receive 
          information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. 
          We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for 
          further information. We are not responsible for the use of your 
          Personally Identifiable Information by any such service provider. In 
          order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will 
          need to go directly to the partner's site. <br>
          <br>
          • <b>Third Party Search Engines.</b> When you create and submit a 
          public profile to Reunion.com, you authorize Reunion.com to publicly 
          disclose such information, other than Personally Identifiable 
          information, through the Reunion.com website as well as 
          other third party search engines and websites.<br>
          <br>
          • <b>Updates to Personal Information.</b> When you become a member, 
          other members and third parties may, through use of our GoodContacts 
          and other specified services, seek to update their personal contact 
          lists by requesting your personal information, including your 
          Personally Identifiable Information. In some cases, businesses may 
          send us a list of personal information in an attempt to re-contact 
          customers or subscribers whose contact information may have changed. 
          WE WILL NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THESE 
          OTHER MEMBERS, BUSINESSES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. 
          We will notify you when any such request for your contact information 
          is made, and you will be provided with the option to accept or decline 
          the request. If you do not respond to this request, you will be 
          considered to have declined the request, and your updated contact 
          information will not be provided. <br>
          <br>
          In the future, we may provide you with the default option of 
          automatically approving the request of any person, business and/or 
          other third party to update their contact information relating to you 
          so that you do not have to approve or reject each individual request 
          for contact information updates. We will notify you when and if we 
          make this default automatic approval option available. If you elect 
          this default option, your contact information will automatically be 
          provided to each member or third party that requests it through the 
          use of our GoodContacts or other specified services. However, you may 
          change your election at any time by changing your preferences.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>C. When You Purchase a Service from 
        Reunion.com</b> –When you purchase a service from Reunion.com, you will 
        be required to provide us with certain contact information, including 
        your name, email address and billing address. We also require other 
        information necessary to process your payment (such as a credit card and 
        expiration date). We may use the information you provide us to bill you 
        for products and services you have requested, or to notify you of 
        additional products and services available to you. By becoming a member, 
        you agree that we may share this information with our service providers, 
        which may include banks and credit card companies we use to process your 
        transaction.<br>
        <br>
        <b>D. Email Updates to Members.</b> The Reunion.com Sites and our 
        partners may periodically send service email updates announcing special 
        offers and/or new features to registered users. If you want to update 
        your email address or stop receiving our email service announcements, 
        please follow the procedures at the bottom of any email we send you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>E. Promotions.</b> We may ask you for Personally Identifiable 
        Information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you 
        enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions sponsored by a third party. If 
        you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions of this nature, 
        we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties 
        involved in the promotion so they can contact you. They may use that 
        information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is 
        possible that your information may be shared with others.<br>
        <br>
        <b>F. Surveys and User Research.</b> Reunion.com conducts email and 
        web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to 
        gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that 
        taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no 
        obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of 
        these surveys, not individual data, with our advertisers and partners to 
        help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their 
        advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that 
        our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests 
        and to make the site more useful for you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>G. Use of Cookies.</b> On the Internet, a "cookie" is a piece of 
        information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user's computer for 
        record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. 
        The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site 
        involves cookies. Cookies help us and our advertising service (discussed 
        below) track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also 
        enable us to measure the aggregate or total usage and traffic to our 
        site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that 
        best meets our users’ preferences. In order to implement new services, 
        we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to 
        understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that 
        information to display advertisements that we think will be of 
        particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject 
        cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of the 
        Reunion.com Sites. To find out more about changing your browser to 
        reject cookies, we suggest the EPIC Cookies Page
