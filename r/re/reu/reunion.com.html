                <p>While Reunion.com Sites each offer a different combination of services and  tools from one site to another, this policy states Reunion.com's company-wide  Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices. Please refer to our <a href="http://www.reunion.com/user-agreement">User Agreement</a> for the  registered Members' terms of service, which states the terms of use. </p>
                <p>By registering as a Member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree to accept this  Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed  below. </p>
                
                <h2>Overview of Our Policy</h2>
                <p>The security of your personal information is a high priority at Reunion.com. We  maintain these websites and all associated data with technical, administrative,  and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access,  destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. No computer system  or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard, but  Reunion.com is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security  controls to protect our websites and their information against foreseeable  hazards. </p>
                <p>The information you provide helps us and our partners (including our service  providers, advertisers, and other partners) make the Reunion.com Sites more fun  and useful for you. It also enables us to provide you updates about our  services and special offers from our partners. When you become a registered  Member of our site, you may receive email or postal mail from Reunion.com. If  you have so elected, you may also receive email or postal mail from our  partners. </p>
                <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public  areas of a Reunion.com Site, such as the user profile pages, message boards, or  people search, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others, both  on the Reunion.com Sites and potentially on our partners' sites, such as  Wink.com. We advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone  number, email address, street address, or instant messenger address ("personally  identifiable information") within these public areas that they do not wish  to share. This information should instead be maintained in the appropriate  email and contact information section of this site, which is protected under  the terms of this privacy policy. </p>
                
                <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is available on this page for you to read. This Privacy  Policy may be updated and modified from time to time to reflect new features,  services and options, as well as any other changes with regard to the use of  personal information. Users  will be notified by email and shown a prominent  notice on the home pages of the Reunion.com Sites of any material changes to  our Privacy Policy. By registering as a member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree  to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over  time. Continued use of the Reunion.com Site or other Reunion.com services will  signify that you agree to these changes. </p>
                
                <h2>About Children</h2>
                <p>The Reunion.com Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. The  Reunion.com Sites prohibits registration by and will not knowingly collect  personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. Note to parents: If  you have any concerns about the Reunion.com Sites or their related services, please  contact us by <a href="http://help.reunion.com/">clicking here.</a> </p>
                
                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>Below are more details about the information the Reunion.com Sites gather from  you and how we use it. </p>
                  
                <p><strong>A. Email Newsletters, Updates, and  Invitations.</strong> Reunion.com Sites offer email newsletters and important account  activity updates that may include material that is promotional in nature.&nbsp; These email updates may also include offers  from Reunion.com’s marketing partners.&nbsp; &nbsp;As part of the Reunion.com service you will  receive these updates. If you want to update your email address or stop  receiving any of the updates, follow the unsubscribe procedures at the bottom  of any newsletter or update we send you, or alternatively, you may change your  notification settings by visiting the Email Notification Settings page located  in the My Account area of our site. Please note that even if you unsubscribe  from any promotionally oriented emails, newsletters, or account activity  updates, you may continue to receive transactional email messages from  Reunion.com with important information pertaining to your account and our  services, such as notifications related to a paid subscription. </p>
                <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we  will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically  send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the site, plus two  reminder emails if they do not respond. Reunion.com stores this information for  the sole purpose of sending these emails and tracking the success of our  referral program. </p>
                <p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reunion.com">support@reunion.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database. </p>
                  
                <h2>Your  Contacts and Their Information</h2>
                <p>To make the best use of Reunion.com and to help you keep in touch with your  contacts and with other Members, we make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books to join you on Reunion.com. At your request we will  search your email address book to see if anyone in it is already a Member of  Reunion.com; you can also select and/or input your contacts’ email addresses  manually. Contacts who are not registered Members will receive an email  invitation from us on your behalf inviting them to join. We may follow up such  invitations with two reminder emails to some contacts if they do not respond to  the initial invitation. </p>
                <p>This feature -- a helpful, easy way to connect with your friends and family and  keep everyone updated on your life -- is common on many social networking  sites. Information you enter about your contacts is covered by the same privacy  policy terms as your own personal information on Reunion.com. </p>
                  
                <p><strong>B. Reunion Member Profiles and Registration Information.</strong> As of September 17, 2008, Reunion.com Sites have  two kinds of profiles.&nbsp; A Reunion.com  Member is someone who has created an account by registering on our site (as a  paid or free member), agreed to our <a href="http://www.reunion.com/user-agreement">User Agreement</a>, and personally  submitted profile information.&nbsp; Every  member has a Member Profile, which includes information you provide, and may  also include information available to us from various sources in the public  domain.</p>
                <p>When you register for membership on one of our  sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we  can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At  a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address, and zip  code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site,  updates, and promotions to your interests. We may engage third parties to  perform analysis or data processing of our databases that involves access to  this information in order to better provide you with the services for which you  joined (in which case we will take measures to ensure that such parties are  contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it  other than in a manner that is necessary to perform their work for  Reunion.com). </p>
                  
                <p>We may also use or disclose your membership registration or other personally  identifiable information as follows: </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We sometimes offer our Members services provided by third parties. When you register for       membership on a Reunion.com Site or activate a service by clicking on a       particular service link (e.g., email) on our sites, you may be       automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of       your personally identifiable information may be shared by Reunion.com with       those third-party service providers, such as our credit card processing       company. We take care to require that our third-party service providers       use our Members' data only as necessary to provide the particular service       requested. These service providers may not use this information for any       other purpose, including their own marketing purposes. </li>
                  <li><strong>Co-registration with Other Sites.</strong> As a member, we may offer you the ability to co-register with select       third-party partner sites. In some instances where Reunion.com provides       co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt out of       their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and       accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a       member of their select websites, and your personally identifiable       information is shared with those organizations. As a result, you may       receive information from one of these websites as any of their members       would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies       for further information. We are not responsible for the use of your       personally identifiable information by any such service provider. In order       to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go       directly to the partner's site. Examples include special discount savings       subscription offers from Web Loyalty and Lift Media. </li>
                  <li><strong>Third-Party Search Engines.</strong> When you create, claim or register a public profile at Reunion.com, you authorize Reunion.com to       publicly disclose such information, other than personally identifiable       information, through the Reunion.com website as well as other third-party       search engines and websites. </li>
                  <li><strong>Updates to Personal Information.</strong> When you become a Member, other Members and third parties may, through use       of our Reunion.com for Outlook and other specified services, seek to       update their personal contact lists by requesting your personal       information, including your personally identifiable information. In some       cases, businesses may send us a list of personal information in an attempt       to contact customers or subscribers whose contact information may have       changed. WE WILL NOT PROVIDE YOUR personally identifiable information TO       THESE OTHER MEMBERS, BUSINESSES, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT YOUR       CONSENT. We will notify you when any such request for your contact       information is made, and you will be provided with the option to accept or       decline the request. If you do not respond to this request, you will be       considered to have declined the request, and your updated contact       information will not be provided. </li>
                  <li><strong>Blogs and Forums.</strong> If you use a blog or forum area on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable       information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other       users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.       We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you       choose to submit in these forums. </li>
                  <li><strong>Testimonials.</strong> We use testimonials on this site. We receive your permission to post these prior to their appearance  on our site. If you would like your testimonial removed at any time, please  contact us by <a href="http://help.reunion.com/">clicking here</a>. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>C. Reunion Public Profiles.</strong> A Public Profile is one that has been created by us  using&nbsp; public-domain information.&nbsp; People can search on Reunion.com by name,  age, and state and reconnect with people from their past.&nbsp; If people search for you on the internet, for  example at a search engine such as Google or Yahoo, they may be directed to and  see your public profile.&nbsp; If you are a  member, they will see your Member Profile as well.&nbsp; Your Member Profile may include additional  public domain information, such as your telephone number.&nbsp; We do not have the ability to remove your  profile or information from other people search services, public records  databases, or online search engines.&nbsp; But  we do offer you the ability to claim or register your Public Profile at our  site, including control of the fields of data which are displayed to the  public.&nbsp; Our registration and profile claiming  features, and answers to questions (such as what to do if information is  inaccurate) are described more thoroughly <a href="http://www.reunion.com/faq.pub">here</a>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p><strong>D.&nbsp;When You Purchase a Service from Reunion.com</strong> When you purchase a  service from Reunion.com, you will be required to provide us with certain  contact information, including your name, email address and billing address. We  also require other information necessary to process your payment (such as a  credit card and expiration date). We may use the information you provide us to  bill you for products and services you have requested, or to notify you of  additional products and services available to you. By becoming a Member, you  agree that we may share this information with our service providers, which may  include banks and credit card companies we use to process your transaction.  They are prohibited from using this information for any other purpose including  their own marketing purposes. </p>
                <p><strong>E. Email Updates to Members.</strong> The Reunion.com Sites periodically  send service email updates announcing special offers and/or new features to  registered users. &nbsp;&nbsp;This may also include  email offers from selected marketing partners.&nbsp;  If you want to update your email address or stop receiving any of the  updates, follow the unsubscribe procedures at the bottom of any newsletter.  Alternatively, you may change your notification settings by visiting the Email  Notification Settings page located in the My Account area of our site.</p>
                <p><strong>F. Promotions.</strong> We ask you for personally identifiable information at other times, including but not limited  to when you enter sweepstakes, contests, or promotions sponsored by a third  party. If you choose to enter sweepstakes, contests or promotions of this  nature, we may share your personally identifiable information with third  parties involved in the promotion so they can contact you. They may use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible  that your information may be shared with others.  &nbsp;If you do not want to share your personal information  with these third parties, do not enter into promotions of this nature.</p>
                <p><strong>G. Surveys and User Research.</strong> Reunion.com conducts  email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to  gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that taking  these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond  to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual  data, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our  services and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service. We also  store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help  us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you. </p>
                <p><strong>H. Use of Cookies.</strong> On the Internet, a "cookie" is a  piece of information (a file) that a website transfers to a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The  process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of our site involves  cookies. Cookies help us and our advertising service (discussed below) track  the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to  measure the aggregate or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific  offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users'  preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of  cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that  we think will be of particular interest to you.

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The Reunion.com Sites endeavor to protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us once it is received on our systems. However, when  you submit information about yourself to the Reunion.com Sites over the  Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the  control of Reunion.com. We take the protection of user data very seriously and  to that end provide extra assurances that your information will not be  intercepted.

                <p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card information and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that  information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). </p>
                <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,  is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially  acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you  can email us by <a href="http://help.reunion.com/">clicking here.</a></p>
