<b>1. &nbsp;What personal information does Re-QUEST dot Net™ collect from me?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we value our privacy as much as you do yours, <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ <u>does 
not</u> actively collect any personally identifyable information from you, except that information which is disclosed in Items 2 
and 3 below and in those instances such information is collected only in the aggregate.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time-to-time we may also place an occasional survey or 
questionnaire on our site which you are always free to participate. However, by voluntarily completing one of these surveys or questionnaires you will help us better 
serve you. Wherever a survey or questionnaire asks you for personal information, we always make every effort 
to include a link to this Privacy Policy. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ does not sell or rent such personal information to anyone.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<a name="cookies"></a>
</p><hr size="0" noshade="">

<b>2. &nbsp;What are cookies and how does Re-QUEST dot Net™ use
them?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience. For example, 
when you are first served an advertisement from <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™, we may assign a unique 
random ID to your computer's web browser, this process is commonly referred to in cyberspace as a "<a href="http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=cookie"><font color="#0000FF">cookie</font></a>."  
We do this to understand the way you respond to the advertisments we deliver. For example, this ID lets us keep track of how 
many times you view an advertisement that we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help rotate our advertisements, giving you 
the opportunity to see a variety of advertisments rather than the same advertisement over and over again, thus, enhancing your 
online web viewing experience and making our Web site more profitable at the same time.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time-to-time, we may also use cookies to:
</p>

<ul>
<p align="justify">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Estimate Our Audience Size</u>. Each browser accessing <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may be given a
unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent and duration of a visitor's usage.
</p>

<p align="justify">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Measure Traffic Patterns</u>. In measuring certain traffic patterns of <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ we are able to 
determine which sections of <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ you have visited and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. With this 
information we are better able to expand those sections of <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ which are most often utilized by our visitors 
and give more detail to the ones which are least visited.
</p>

<p align="justify">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Third Party Measurement Services</u>. On occasion, some of our advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service 
for the tracking and performance of a particular advertising campaign.  In these instances, <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ 
has no control over the information being collected by the third party and, therefore, we may not be held responsible for the actions 
of the third party where such collected information is concerned. If you have any questions regarding a specific third party 
measurement service and their respective method of information collection, please <a href="#contact"><font color="#0000FF">contact us</font></a>.
</p></ul>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may also from time-to-time collect <a href="http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=IP+address"><font color="#0000FF">IP addresses</font></a> for use 
in system auditing and administration and, in some instances, we may report such aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, affiliates and/or partners.

<b>3. &nbsp;What is Behavorial Targeting and how is it used?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ uses many third-party advertising companies 
who help us serve the ads which appear on our website. By visiting <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ as well as other websites, 
these third-party companies may use your web surfing habits on an aggregated basis (which does NOT include your name, 
address, telephone number or e-mail address) in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that might 
be of interest to you, as opposed to just showing you random advertisements. Because your behavior, i.e., your recent web 
surfing habits, these advertisements are targeted towards those areas of interest. For instance, if you recently 
visited several pet websites, you might see pet related advertisements. Hence, in the Internet advertising 
community, this is known as "Behavorial Targeting."
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like more information about this practice and want to know 
more about your choices of whether or not to allow this information to be used by these third-party companies, you 
may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="nofollow"><font color="#0000FF">NetworkAdvertising.org</font></a> 
website and choose to opt-out of behavorial targeting.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ does not do any behavorial targeting of 
its own.

<b>4. &nbsp;Who is collecting my information?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you happen to voluntarily complete our demographic survey, rest 
assured any personal information obtained via the survey, i.e. age, occupation, etc., will only be used to make our 
website a better experience for future vistors. Such information may from time to time be collected by third parties 
but only collected in the aggregate. By knowing our vistiors' demographics, you are helping us expand those areas of 
interest which attract the most visitor attention.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ is involved in several affiliate programs. 
These programs are conducted by reputable companies that have separate privacy polices and data collection practices. 
<b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more 
information regarding these affiliate programs and their privacy policies, please visit these affiliate sites 
and review their separate policy regarding your privacy.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have painstakeningly visited, reviewed and eliminated web sites from our directory which we feel are malicious or which exist solely to collect personal information from you, usually to sell or trade to others. Nothwithstanding this effort, you should be aware that <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ does contain links to a few web sites that may collect some 
personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites are 
not covered under this Privacy Policy. Please consult these Websites for their own privacy policy to understand how they may treat your personal information.

<b>5. &nbsp;How is my information being used?</b>

<b>6. &nbsp;Who are you sharing my information with?</b>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ does not disclose any personally
identifiable information about you except when we have your permission or under
special circumstances. Some special circumstances may include, but are not limited to, 
the following:
</p>

<ul>
<p align="justify">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Aggregated User Statistics</u>. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, frequency of visits, demographics, survey results, etc.)

</p>

<p align="justify">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Other Lawful Instances</u>. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may disclose user information in special cases
when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or
unintentionally) with, our rights or property, other <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ visitors, or
anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ may also disclose
such user information when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it.

</p><hr size="0" noshade="">

<b>7. &nbsp;What choices do I have regarding the collection, use and
distribution of my information?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we strongly believe in your right to privacy, we take this time to alert you to the several choices you have with respect to cookies. 
By modifying your web browser's preferences, you have the ability to accept all cookies, to be notified 
when a cookie is about to be set, or to reject cookies altogether. Please consult your web browser's help

<b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ will not be impaired.

<b>8. &nbsp;What kind of security precautions does Re-QUEST dot Net™ take to protect 
my information from misuse?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, cyberspace has not yet evolved to a realm where 
the Internet is a totally secure environment. Consequently, no data transmission over the Internet can be 
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, <b>Re-QUEST 
dot Net</b>™ cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. However, 
once we are in receipt of a transmission from you, we make every effort to ensure its security while it is in 
our possession, custody or control, including limiting the availability of your personal information to only 
key <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ personnel and by storing such information offline in a secured and 
password protected environment.

<b>9. &nbsp;How does Re-QUEST dot Net™ serve to protect children's privacy?</b>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The safety of children surfing the Internet is of great importantance to us at <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™. 
As such, <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from 
children of any age. Notwithstanding this, children should always ask a parent for permission before sending any personal
information to <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™, or to anyone else in cyberspace for that matter. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ 
does not share personal information about its visitors with third parties regardless of their age, except 
as outlined in herein, and in those instances only in the aggregate.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, while our web site was designed to be user friendly to both students and professionals, 
we are aware of our attractiveness to children, especially those doing homework assignments. We have, therefore, not provided any links to web sites 
which we believe may contain content not suitable or appropriate for children of any age. In addition, our <a href="search/index.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Search 
Engine</font></a> has been specifically designed to weed out inappropriate, lewd and sexual content. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ will always strive to protect 
children from the black holes of cyberspace and we challenge other web sites to join us in this endeavor.
</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ has fully complied with the requirements of the 
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</font></a> as well as the recommendations regarding the same as published by the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Federal Trade Commission</font></a>. 
In our attempt to better serve our younger audience, our actions not to seek out personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 13 without prior written permission from their parents or guardians pre-dates 
the concerns of Congress and the aforementioned legislative Act. Rest assured, while visiting <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™, your children will be treated as if they were our own. <b>Re-QUEST dot Net</b>™ 
takes every precaution to keep our content and your children's privacy our top concern.

<b>10. &nbsp;What else should I know about online privacy?</b></a>
<p></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep in mind and be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose any personal information online, 
<i>i.e.</i> through e-mail, usenet newsgroups, message boards or in chat arenas, such information 
may be collected and used by others. In essence, if you post personal information online it becomes 
part of the public domain and, thus, you can expect to receive some unsolicited messages and 
advertisements, commonly referred to in cyberspace as "<a href="http://www.netlingo.com/lookup.cfm?term=spam"><font color="#0000FF">spam</font></a>." 
Some of these may come from less than reputable people and sources.
