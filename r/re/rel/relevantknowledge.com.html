            Our online market research community has millions of participants who are interested in voicing their opinions through surveys and allowing their passively-tracked online browsing and purchasing behavior to be used as part of anonymous market research reports that help shape the future of the Internet. The information that you contribute is used by comScore Networks, Inc., a U.S.-based market research company that is a nationally-recognized authority on Internet and general economic trends, whose data are routinely cited by major media outlets such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and CNBC, and is extensively used by the largest Internet services companies and scores of Fortune 500 companies.<br><br>
            Be assured that protection of your privacy is one of our top priorities. Our privacy procedures are regularly audited and certified by the nationally-recognized firm, Ernst &amp; Young, who assure that we conform with the international trust services and privacy principles developed and managed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. While participation in our program will allow us to send you periodic surveys and track information about your online activities such as where you surf and the transactions that you make, <u>the personally identifiable information you provide to us will NOT be used by us, or anyone with whom we do business, to advertise or market products or services to you!</u><br><br>

          <div class="C_TD">
            
              <u>Basic Demographic Information:</u> When you sign up for this program, we may obtain your contact information and some basic demographic information about you using a questionnaire, information from companies through which you obtained or inquired about this program, or the application that you install onto your computer and allow to track your Internet usage.<br><br>
            
              <u>Survey response information:</u> Once you agree to participate in this program, we may notify you of survey opportunities through e-mail, pop-ups, toast windows, U.S. mail, and other means. If you elect to participate in a survey, we require that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself and your household.<br><br>
            
              <u>Computer hardware, software, and other configuration information:</u> Our application may collect certain basic hardware, software, computer configuration and application usage information about the computer on which you install our application, including such data as the speed of the computer processor, its memory capacities and Internet connection speed.  In addition, our application may report on devices connected to your computer, such the type of printer or router you may be using.<br><br>
            
              <u>Internet usage information:</u> Once you install our application, it monitors all of the Internet behavior that occurs on the computer on which you install the application, including both your normal web browsing and the activity that you undertake during secure sessions, such as filling a shopping basket, completing an application form or checking your online accounts, which may include personal financial or health information. We may use the information that we monitor, such as name and address, for the purpose of better understanding your household demographics; however we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers. Inadvertently, we may collect such information about our panelists; and when this happens, we make commercially viable efforts to purge our database of such information.
            <br><br>
            This application also tracks the pace and style with which you enter information online (for example, whether you click on links, type in webpage names, or use shortcut keys), the usage of cookies, and statistics about your use of online applications (for example, it may observe that during a given period of use of a computer, the computer downloaded X number of bytes of data using a particular Internet enabled gaming application).<br><br>
            Please note: Our application does not examine the contents of your instant messages or e-mail messages. We may, however, review select e-mail header information from web-based e-mails as a way to verify your contact information and your online usage information.<br><br>

            </div><br>
          
          <div class="C_TD">
            This application monitors your Internet usage by transmitting to our servers information about the web pages that you visit and the actions that you take while online. In addition, we may ask for information about you using surveys, for which participation is completely voluntary. We may also combine the information that you provide us with additional information (such as select credit bureau and prescription information) or with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies, credit reporting agencies, and prescription benefits managers) using confidential matching procedures. In these cases, we will: (i) provide the third party data match processor only the personal information necessary to perform a match and, infrequently, to assist us performing statistical analyses; (ii) establish procedures and legal obligations that prohibit use of the information received for any other purpose or disclosure of this information to anyone else; and (iii) require destruction of the received information after completion of the match. The information that we obtain from other sources will not include confidential personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers and account numbers. Your information is stored in the United States where our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of other countries may differ from those of the United States.<br><br>

            </div><br>
          
          <div class="C_TD">
            
              <u>Market Research Reports:</u> Applying concepts similar to those used by television-rating services, we use the information collected through our application and your survey responses, combined with information from other sources, to make statistically-based projections about current and future Internet user behavior and, more generally, to extrapolate data about potential economic trends.  For certain commercial customers, we may provide individual-level information. We make this data available so that these customers may enhance their own understanding of Internet usage and online commercial trends.  In all cases, we make commercially viable efforts to automatically filter confidential personally identifiable information such as UserID, password, credit card numbers, and account numbers from the data being provided.
            <br><br>
            Our customers use our market research reports to: (i) modify online services and offerings; (ii) make more effective use of online data to understand both online and offline commercial behavior; and (iii) discern general economic trends and the business performance of specific entities for a wide range of business purposes including, but not limited to, identifying financial investment opportunities and understanding the value and interest in certain business enterprises.<br><br>
            
              <u>By Service Providers:</u> From time to time, we may share your contact information with those third parties who help us deliver this program to you (for example, companies that administer incentive programs). When we do this, we provide only the necessary information for the service provider to perform its assigned function, and we contractually prohibit the use or disclosure of this information to anyone else unless you authorize it.<br><br>
            
              <u>As Required by Law:</u> In rare cases, and as is done by any other business, if we are compelled to disclose certain information through a valid legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, or a search warrant, we would do so. However, we would comply by providing only the minimum information necessary.<br><br>

          <div class="C_TD">
            
              <u>Safeguards:</u> We have implemented a variety of safeguards (including physical, digital, and legal protections) focused on ensuring that the information collected through this program is protected from unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure. For example, any secure information collected by our application is encrypted before it is sent to our servers. Moreover, our employees are subjected to periodic evaluation and investigation, are contractually restricted on their use and access to personally identifiable information, and are educated and retrained as needed on internal security policies and procedures.<br><br>
            
              <u>Independent Third Party Verification:</u> We recognize that your trust is difficult to earn. To help us earn this trust, we allow third parties to periodically challenge and test our data security and information handling practices to ensure we are achieving our goal of vigorously protecting participant data. Since late 2000, our market research systems have been one of a handful to earn the honor of achieving the certification of one of the nation’s leading assurance providers, Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”). Prior to certification, we must undergo an evaluation of our privacy and data security practices including our data acquisition, processing and reporting procedures. E&amp;Y verifies: (a) we only collect the information we declare we collect, and (b) we only use that information in ways we have disclosed to our members. Their examination also includes attempts to break into and compromise the hardware and security systems we have built. E&amp;Y’s review is base on an international set of online privacy principles and criteria for systems and electronic commerce, which requires that the entity meet extensive standards for the protection of personally identifiable information collected through its online systems.  <a href="JavaScript:call_ey();">Click here</a> for more information regarding this review or the principles upon which it is based.<br><br>

After you remove our application from a computer, all settings we have made to your computer will be deactivated; however, some inactive elements may remain on your machine such as registry entries or DLL files, which is not at all unusual for many types of online services and software.<br><br>
            
              <u>Use of Third Party Programs to Remove our Software:</u> Please note that use of third party programs to remove this application may cause instability in your system and to your Internet connection.
