<p><a name="SECURITY"></a><b>SECURITY MEASURES</b></p></center>

<p>RelayHealth employs a high degree of security consciousness.  The environment at RelayHealth currently encompasses the 
highest level of security as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security tenets that of 
the proposed regulations.  The overall priorities of RelayHealth as an organization are to ensure security and be fully compliant 
with all HIPAA regulations, proposed and finalized.  Access, integrity, availability, ownership, authorization, dependability, authentication, 
and confidentiality are all major considerations within the RelayHealth Security Policy. </p>

<p>RelayHealth upholds its stringent Security Policy with the following security measures: 
</p><p>· <u><strong>Audit Trail.</strong></u>  RelayHealth maintains an audit trail and log of accesses to your medical profile. 

</p><p>· <u><strong>Role-Based Usage</strong></u>.  RelayHealth grants varying degrees of access to users with different 
levels of authority within a provider practice. 

</p><p>· <u><strong>Encryption</strong></u>.  All communication between you and the RelayHealth server is secured by using SSL 
version 3.0, which uses 128-bit encryption. This is the highest level of encryption currently available commercially. 

</p><p>· <u><strong>Data Security</strong></u>.  RelayHealth is taking all reasonable measures to secure your data on our servers, 
in our data center.  Our data center is both physically and electronically secured.  Our servers are isolated from the Internet by 
using a firewall which is a hardware and software system that blocks access by unauthorized parties. 

</p><p>· <strong><u>Confidentiality</u></strong>.  RelayHealth has internal policies that keep your data private and confidential, 
and will not share your data with any other party. 

</p><p>· <strong><u>Login ID and Password.</u></strong>  Access to your account is controlled by a login ID and a password, 
which you chose.  Strict login ID and password rules virtually eliminate the unauthorized user from gaining access. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Auto-Logoff.</u></strong>  RelayHealth protects you against accidentally leaving your personal 
information active on a computer browser screen. The RelayHealth service ends your “session” if you are logged in to 
RelayHealth but have not actively used the service for a set period of time. This prevents others from accessing your 
account when you leave a session and forget to log out. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Digital Certificates.</u></strong>  RelayHealth uses a digital certificate issued by RSA 
Data Security, Inc., a leading Secure Server Certification Authority. This gives you the confidence that you are 
connected to a site operated by RelayHealth, and authenticated as such. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Sensitive Information.</u></strong>  RelayHealth handles all your health information 
with respect to its confidentiality and privacy. We ask that you follow your provider’s policy on communicating 
sensitive information in their practice. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Business Partners.</u></strong>  We require people we do business with to obey privacy 
and security laws and respect HIPAA regulations. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Disaster Recovery.</u></strong>  We currently utilize the highest levels of disaster 
recovery available on the market which ensure uptime by preventing outages caused by power, security, 
environment, fire, and natural disasters. Within these facilities, RelayHealth is able to deliver the highest levels of 
reliability through a number of redundant subsystems, such as multiple Internet trunks coming into from multiple 
sources, fully redundant power on the premises, and multiple backup generators. 
</p><p>· <strong><u>Data Integrity.</u></strong>  RelayHealth employs the latest products and technology to 
ensure data is always available and access to the site continues without interruption.

<p>We will not sell, share or rent this information that is collected in the RelayHealth service to others in ways different than from what is disclosed in this policy.   RelayHealth collects information from you at several points in our service.  </p>

	<u>
<strong>What does RelayHealth do with anonymous (de-identified) information? </strong></u>
<p>RelayHealth removes your identity from your personal information (contact, health and/or financial) and may work with it as anonymous ("de-identified") information.</p>

<p>Individual information is information about a user presented in a form where information about one anonymous user would be indistinguishable from information relating to other anonymous users ("a 40 year old female"). Individual information is not in a form that allows anyone studying the information to personally identify any user.</p>


<p>Aggregate information is information that describes the habits, usage patterns and/or demographics of users as a group but does not reveal the identity of particular users. Your anonymous data is combined with the anonymous data of other RelayHealth users and becomes statistics. </p>

<p>We might use aggregate information within RelayHealth to understand the needs of the RelayHealth community of users and determine what kinds of programs and services we can help your Provider offer to you. RelayHealth could use this anonymous information to give potential users, providers, or business partners a picture of the RelayHealth community and services.</p>

<p>
Aggregate information may be provided or sold to third parties. Absolutely no personal identifying information is included in the aggregate reports; each individual remains anonymous.
</p>

<p>Locator information is your name, electronic messaging address, physical address, and / or other data that enables someone to personally identify you. RelayHealth and your Internet Access Provider may use Locator Information as is necessary to enforce any of the terms of the RelayHealth Terms of Use.</p>
