				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Vin DiCarlo, Inc., Altare  Publishing, Inc., and Mad Scientist Marketing, Ltd. (hereinafter collectively  referred to as "<strong>Altare</strong>") &nbsp;are committed to respecting the privacy rights  of users of the Website (all capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy  Policy have the same meanings as in Altare’s <a href="terms.php">Terms of Service</a>). Altare  created this Privacy Policy to give You confidence as You visit and use the Website,  and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information practices and to the  protection of privacy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is only  applicable to the Website and not to any websites of third parties (“<strong>Third-Party Websites</strong>”), which may have  data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially  from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see the section  concerning Third-Party Websites, below.<br>
BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU  REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS  OF, THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND  BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE WEBSITE.<br>
Each time You use the  Website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly,  each time You use the Website You should check the date of this Privacy Policy  (which appears at the end) and review any changes since the last time You used  the Website. For additional information, see the section concerning Updates and  Changes to Privacy Policy, below.</p>
        <h3> 1. CHILDREN’S  PRIVACY</h3>
        <p>BY USING THE WEBSITE OR  SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND ARE  OTHERWISE LEGALLY QUALIFIED TO ENTER INTO AND FORM CONTRACTS UNDER APPLICABLE  LAW. </p>
          <p>Because all users of the  Website are required to be at least 18 years of age, Altare does not solicit or  knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the  age of 13. If Altare obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally  identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, Altare will  immediately delete such information from its database. Because Altare does not  collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, Altare  has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. Altare has  designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online  Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). </p>
        <h3>2. INFORMATION  COLLECTION PRACTICES </h3>
        <p class="list2"><strong>(a) Traffic Data.&nbsp; </strong>Like most website operators, Altare automatically  gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available,  including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers  accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website  (collectively “<strong>Traffic Data</strong>”). Traffic  Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.</p>
        <p class="list2"><strong>(b) Cookies.&nbsp; </strong>A “<strong>Cookie</strong>” is a string of information that  a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to  the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a  Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Altare uses  Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure  that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages  repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each  time You visit the Website. For additional information on Altare’s uses of  Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure  Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.<strong></strong></p>
        
        <p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE  COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES  BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE  SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT  THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR  ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </p>
        <p class="list2" id="linked"><strong>(c) Ad Serving.</strong> Altare  uses third-parties for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These  third-parties may place cookies on Your machine, use web beacons, gather IP  addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to send to the  United States in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and  advertising.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
        <p class="list2"><strong>(d) Personal  Information.&nbsp; </strong>In order for You to use certain of the Website services,  You will be asked to provide Altare certain information that personally  identifies You (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”).  Personal Information includes, without limitation: (1) “<strong>Contact Data</strong>” (such as Your e-mail address, website URLs, avatar  URLs, and instant messaging screen names); and (2) <strong>Demographic Data</strong>” (such as Your date of birth and gender).<strong> </strong>In  each case, You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will not  gather it surreptitiously. Altare may supplement the Personal Information You  provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or  from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide  such information to Altare.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
        <p>You are under no obligation  to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may  prevent You from using certain of the Services.</p>
        <p class="list2"><strong>(e) Information You Make Public.</strong> The Website contains features that permit You to  upload, post, transmit, display, perform or distribute content, information or  other, including Your Personal Information. Any information that You choose to  disclose by means of such features becomes public information over which Altare  is unable to exercise control. You should exercise caution when deciding to  disclose Your Personal Information by means of such features, and You agree to  assume all responsibility for doing so.</p>
