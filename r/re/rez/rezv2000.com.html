<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Who may use this website.</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This website is not intended or designed to attract 
  users under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable data from 
  any person we know to be under the age of 18 and instruct users under 18 not 
  to send us any information. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This site is restricted to users from the United
    States. Users from other countries are advised not to disclose personal information
    on this website. You transmit data to a server located in the State of Florida

<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Information collected from you.</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The kinds of information we collect from you will 
  vary, depending on how you use our website. It's possible to browse our site 
  without submitting any personal information at all. In order to take part in 
  certain services on our website, you will be required to provide certain personal 
  information (e.g., your name, address, e-mail address, etc.). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the information you choose to submit, 
  our systems are set up to gather certain anonymous data to help us better understand 
  how our site is being used and how we can improve it. This automatically gathered 
  data includes any content you view on our website.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">How your information is used.</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We utilize "cookies" on our site. These are small 
  files that we send to and store on your computer so that we may recognize it 
  as a unique machine the next time you visit our site. Our cookies are used to 
  let us know you are a prior customer and to help us personalize your online 
  experience by providing you with advertisements and messages of interest to 
  you. Also, companies offering products or services through our website may use 
  their own cookies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The personal information you provide is used among 
  other uses to help us customize your online experience. Your e-mail address 
  serves as a unique identifier in our record system, and it is used together 
  with a password to prevent unauthorized access to any information you choose 
  to store on our site. The data you give us about your personal preferences and 
  demographics (such as age, ZIP code, occupation, or other data) may be used 
  to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that are most 
  likely to appeal to you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will use your personal information to respond 
  to requests you may make of us, and from time to time, we may refer to such 
  information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our website, 
  products and services. We may also use this personal information to contact 
  you and/or provide you with general health information (like information on 
  certain health conditions). We may share this personal information with other 
  companies who offer products and services that may be of interest to you. We 
  may also enhance or merge this personal information with data obtained from 
  third parties for the same purposes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unless you specify that you'd prefer not to hear 
  from us, we may also use the e-mail address you provide at registration to contact 
  you for promotional, administrative, or other reasons. You may have these communications 
  terminated. This likely will take 48 hours from the time you give us notice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The information gathered automatically by our
    system—such 
  as your computer's IP address, the kind of browser you're using, and a record 
  of your navigation through our site—may be used by us so we can understand
  how to make our site convenient and useful to our audience and to improve our
products and services. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We may link information collected from you through
    various means, including information collected automatically and through
    the
  use of cookies and personal information, with information we learn via Nutri
    Blvd Customer 
  Care and from Rewards Program members. Our goal is to help offer you content,
    advertisements, products, and services that are most likely to appeal to
    you.

<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Access to Your Personal Information.</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the event that Nutri

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nutri Blvd may use your personal information to

    Blvd does not intend to reveal personal information 
  to third parties except in the manner stated in this Privacy Policy. Nutri
    Blvd will provide aggregated information received from you to third
    parties. Nutri

  of your personal information, and we are committed to employing reasonable technology 
  in order to protect the security of our website. Even with such technology, 
  no website is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures that we believe 
  are appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or 
  destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we 
  may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security.
