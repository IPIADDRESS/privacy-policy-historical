															<p>5). <strong>Third party personal information.</strong> If you choose to provide us with a third party's personal information (such as name, email, and phone number), you must ensure that you have the third party's permission to do so.

																				<h3>2. Device Information</h3>
															<p>1). <strong>Device setup information.</strong> We collect information related to the setup and usage of Reolink products, such as device name, model, UID, and adjustments you make to the product setup.</p>
															<p>2). <strong>Technical information about the device</strong> such as firmware and software version, WiFi signal strength and environmental data from Reolink’s sensors like ambient light in the room.</p>
															<p>3). <strong>Video and audio.</strong> Reolink Products enables you to determine the purpose and the means for which you collect video and audio signals data. When you enable the recording or streaming features of your camera, we may record and process video and/or audio recordings from the device, subject to your instruction, configuration and settings. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. If you subscribe to Reolink Cloud, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period (for example, 7, 30 or 60 days) and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time.</p>
															<p>4). <strong>Information about your mobile device,</strong> such as mobile device ID, device model and operating system, to enable Reolink App/Client to function properly.</p>
															<p>5). <strong>Information from interaction with Third Parties.</strong> If Reolink offers any product or account connections or integrations with third-party products, applications, functionality, or services (collectively, "Third-Party Products and Services"), and you choose to enable or connect to such Third-Party Products and Services through the means authorized and directed by Reolink and/or such third-party partners, you acknowledge and agree that we may share certain information about your Reolink Product with such third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the activation, connection and integration with and to such Third-Party Products and Services on such third parties’ platforms. For example, some of our Products use third-party voice assistance services like Google Assistant, which collects information including your Product name to display it on Google-enabled devices.</p>
															<p>In some cases, Reolink or the Third-Party partner will instead (or also) ask for permission to control the Reolink products and services and/or third-party products and Services that you have activated and connected to.

															<p>Any Reolink data that you choose to share with a third party, either directly or by or on behalf of Reolink through the authorizations, integrations and connections, is governed by that third party’s privacy policy while in that party’s possession.</p>
															<p>Any data that Reolink receives from third parties will be processed and stored by Reolink and will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This information may be processed in the same ways as any other data.</p>
