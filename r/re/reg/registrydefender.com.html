<h1>Registry Defender Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection and use practices of Grab Media Holdings, LLC, for its software Registry Defender ("Registry Defender") in connection with the Registry Defender Web site (the "Web Site") and all associated Registry Defender products and services (the "Registry Defender Services").</p>

<p>Registry Defender will not directly inform you of any changes to the privacy policy which involve use of your personal information. If at anytime you are dissatisfied with our service to you or are in disagreement with our terms and conditions or privacy policy, you reserve the option to Opt-out of our website and future communication.</p>

<h2>What Information We Collect/How We Use It.</h2>
<p>We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide our marketing partners if you joined Registry Defender though one of our partners) requests that you provide certain contact and profile information. That information includes but may not be limited to: name, address, email address, phone number, gender and birth date.</p>

<p>In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your Registry Defender membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you).</p>

<p>We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a Registry Defender e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify the information you have provided by sending an e-mail to info@registrydefender.com with your requested changes.</p>

<p>When you submit personal information, it is kept in a secure database to ensure that is not subject to any unauthorized data usage.</p>

<p>We use all this information in five ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery, telemarketing and/or direct mail. These may include personalized offers from 3rd party sources.</li>
<li>to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;</li>
<li>to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;</li>
<li>to send you general and administrative information about Registry Defender via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and</li>
<li>to provide your contact information to Registry Defender marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of Personal Information </h2>

<p>We may share non-personal, summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties. However, any individual customer's information provided for partners or third parties under contract with Grab Media Holdings, LLC, shall be used only to perform or complete a necessary transaction or function related to the customer's purchase. These transactions or functions shall be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. In some cases, Grab Media Holdings, LLC, may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for web site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue.</p>

<h2>Agents</h2>

<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for Registry Defender.</p>

<h2>Third-party Advertising</h2>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like to be removed from any 3rd party advertising and solicitation through E-mail, telemarketing, or direct mail please send your request to info@registrydefender.com or simply go to http://www.registrydefender.com/email.aspx and enter the email address you would like removed.</p>

Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>

<h2>E-Mail Links</h2>

<p>In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements and content, and to better understand and serve you.</p>

<h2>Disclosures</h2>
