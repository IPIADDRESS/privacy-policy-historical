        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">DR globalDirect, Inc. Operates This Web site</strong>
        
        <br><br>This Web site is hosted and operated by DR globalDirect, Inc. ("we," "us," and "our"), an independent e-commerce reseller.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Scope of This Privacy Policy</strong>
        
        <br><br>This DR globalDirect Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy") describes how DR globalDirect protects your privacy when you use this Web site.
        
        <br><br>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected through DR globalDirect Web sites. "Personal information" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Privacy Notices</strong>
        
        <br><br>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time-to-time by "Privacy Notices" posted on this Web site. These Privacy Notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of this Web site contain Privacy Notices providing details about the personal information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Country-Specific Notices</strong>
        
        <br><br>Privacy requirements vary from country-to-country. To meet these requirements, we have included certain "Country-Specific Notices" as part of this Privacy Policy. You may locate the Country-Specific Notice for your country, if there is one, by scrolling to the end of this Privacy Policy.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">This Privacy Policy May Change</strong>
        
        <br><br>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on this Web site. These changes will only apply to personal information we collect after we have posted the revised Privacy Policy. Your use of this Web site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all personal information collected from or about you through this Web site after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.
        
        <br><br>To alert you to these changes, we will update the effective date of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide a notice at the top of this Privacy Policy for at least 30 days after the new effective date and highlight the changes so that you can locate them easily. Unless the change is a minor change (such as a change in our contact information) or a non-substantive change (such as the reformatting of our Privacy Policy), we will post notices on the page where you submit your order and/or on other relevant pages of this Web site for 30 days after the new effective date to alert you to the change.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">What Personal Information Do We Collect Through this Web site?</strong>
        
        <br><br><em>Information You Volunteer.</em> We collect the personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Web site, for example, the information you provide when you request information about products or services. This information may include your name, street and e-mail address, phone number, credit card information, and information used to verify your identity or to prevent fraud.
        
        <br><br><em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em> We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. This information typically includes your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed this Web site, the name of your operating system (such as Windows® or Macintosh®), the name and version of your browser (such as Netscape® or Internet Explorer®), and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
        
        <br><br>The information provided by your browser does not identify you personally. We use this non-personal information primarily to create statistics that help us improve the DR globalDirect Web sites and make them more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs -- which contain visitors' IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.
        
        <br><br><em>Information Collected Using "Cookies" and Other Web Technologies.</em> We use "cookies," and similar technologies, such as Web Beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels," or "action tags"), to collect personal information and support the functionality of this Web site. For more information about our use of cookies and Web Beacons, see below.
        
        <br><br><strong style="font-size: 14px;">Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>
        
        <br><br><em>Cookies and Web Beacons.</em> A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer by our Web server. We may use two types of cookies -- "session cookies" and "persistent cookies."
        
        <br><br><em>Session Cookies.</em> A "session cookie" is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser. A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access one of our Sites. Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our Web sites, by permitting us to maintain a persistent "state" for your session, such as, maintaining the contents of your shopping basket during checkout. We also use session cookies to collect information about the ways visitors use this Web site - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "click-stream information") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this Web site.
        
        <br><br>Sessions cookies do not contain your personal information. If, however, you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Web site, we may link the session cookie identification number to information that identifies you personally.
        
        <br><br><em>Persistent Cookies.</em> When you visit this Web site, we may place one or more "persistent cookies" on your computer. Unlike a "session cookie," a persistent cookie does not expire when you close your browser. It stays on your computer until it expires (for example, at the end of the calendar year) or until you delete it.
        
        <br><br>Some persistent cookies simply "tag" your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognize you, not by name, but by the "tag" on your computer. This will enable us to provide you with a personalized experience even if we do not know who you are. It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this Web site, for example, how people use this Web site on their first visit and how often they return. If, at some point, you create a user identity, we may link the information collected by these persistent cookies to information in our database that identifies you personally. We may also transfer this information to a cookie and place it on your computer's hard drive so that our web server can read this information each time you visit this Web site. In either case, using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.
        
        <br><br>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Web site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Web site. For example, you will not be able to purchase products and services on this Web site.
        
        <br><br><em>Web Beacons.</em> Web beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels" or "action tags") are graphic images, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, placed at various locations on our Site. Web beacons help us recognize the cookies on your browser. Like cookies, Web beacons help us collect information about the ways visitors use our Sites. They also help us identify browser types, IP addresses, search terms that bring visitors to our Sites, and the domain names of the Web sites that refer traffic to us. The information collected by Web beacons does not identify you personally.
