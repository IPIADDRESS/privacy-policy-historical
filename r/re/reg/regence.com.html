<b>

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Income, when necessary for coverage.</font></li>
  
</ul>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Why do we collect your personal information?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We collect personal information from you to help

</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">We collect your personal
information through you and your health care providers. For example, we receive
personal information from you on your insurance application and from your health
care providers through insurance transactions, such as the submission of a claim
for reimbursement of covered benefits.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To whom do we disclose your personal information?</font></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will not disclose your
personal information unless we are allowed or required by law to make the
disclosure, or if you give us permission. Following are some examples of
disclosures we may make as allowed or required by law:</font></p>
<ul>

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To health care providers (doctors and others
      who provide you with care) in connection with an insurance transaction,
      such as verifying that you have coverage;</font></li>

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To service companies that perform insurance
      functions on our behalf, such as third party administrators, insurance
      agents, auditors, benefit consultants, or care management specialists for
      utilization management and quality improvement;</font></li>

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To an insurance regulatory authority; or</font></li>
  

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To respond to legal requests such as a
      subpoena.</font></li>

</ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will not disclose your
personal information to any non-affiliated company for that companyâ€™s
marketing purposes.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">We may share your financial
information with our affiliated companies for marketing purposes to better serve
your needs as one of our customers. Financial information means information
about your income or your identity, such as your name, age, or address. An
affiliated company means a company owned or controlled by us. For example, if
you choose to purchase insurance from us, we may share your financial
information with an affiliated life insurance company to make our full range of
insurance products and services available to you. Also, when you reach a certain
age, we may share your financial information with an affiliate to alert you of
additional products or programs for which you may become eligible, such as
Medicare or Medicaid.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How do we protect your personal information?</font></p>
</b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We protect your personal information by:</font></p>
<ul>

    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Treating all of your personal information
      that we collect as confidential;</font></li>


  
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stating confidentiality policies and
      practices in our employee handbooks as well as disciplinary measures for
      privacy violations;</font></li>
  

  
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Restricting access to your personal
      information only to those employees who need to know your personal
      information in order to provide our services to you, such as paying a
      claim for a covered benefit;</font></li>
 

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Only disclosing your personal information that
    is necessary for a service company to perform its function on our behalf,
    and the company agrees to protect and maintain the confidentiality of your
    personal information;</font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Maintaining physical, electronic, and
    procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state regulations to
    guard your personal information.</font></li>
</ul>
<b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Can I "opt out " of certain
disclosures?</font></p>
</b>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">You may have received notices
from other organizations that allow you to "opt out" of certain
disclosures. The most common type of disclosure that applies to "opt
outs" is the disclosure of personal information to a non-affiliated company
so that company can market its products or services to you. As a health plan, we
must follow many federal and state laws that prohibit us from making these types
of disclosures. Because we do not make disclosures that apply to "opt
outs," it is not necessary for you to complete an "opt out" form
or take any action to restrict such disclosures.</font></p>
