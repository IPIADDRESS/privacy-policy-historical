                          your health care providers. For example, we receive 
                          personal information from you on your insurance application 
                          and from your health care providers through insurance 
                          transactions, such as the submission of a claim for 
                          reimbursement of covered benefits.</p>
                        <p><b>To whom do we disclose your personal information?</b></p>

                          or if you give us permission. Following are some examples 
                          of disclosures we may make as allowed or required by 
                          law:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>To health care providers (doctors and others who

                            transaction, such as verifying that you have coverage; 
                          </li>
                          <li>To service companies that perform insurance functions 
                            on our behalf, such as third party administrators, 
                            insurance agents, auditors, benefit consultants, or 
                            care management specialists for utilization management 
                            and quality improvement; </li>
                          <li>To an insurance regulatory authority; or </li>

                        </ul>

                          purposes.</p>
                        <p>We may share your financial information with our affiliated 
                          companies for marketing purposes to better serve your 
                          needs as one of our customers. Financial information 
                          means information about your income or your identity, 
                          such as your name, age, or address. An affiliated company 
                          means a company owned or controlled by us. For example, 
                          if you choose to purchase insurance from us, we may 
                          share your financial information with an affiliated 
                          life insurance company to make our full range of insurance 
                          products and services available to you. Also, when you 
                          reach a certain age, we may share your financial information 
                          with an affiliate to alert you of additional products 
                          or programs for which you may become eligible, such 
                          as Medicare or Medicaid.</p>
                        <p><b>How do we protect your personal information?</b></p>
                        <p>We protect your personal information by:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Treating all of your personal information that we

                          <li>Stating confidentiality policies and practices in 
                            our employee handbooks as well as disciplinary measures 
                            for privacy violations; </li>
                          <li>Restricting access to your personal information 
                            only to those employees who need to know your personal 
                            information in order to provide our services to you, 
                            such as paying a claim for a covered benefit; </li>
                          <li>Only disclosing your personal information that is 
                            necessary for a service company to perform its function 
                            on our behalf, and the company agrees to protect and 
                            maintain the confidentiality of your personal information; 
                          </li>
                          <li>Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural 
                            safeguards that comply with federal and state regulations 
                            to guard your personal information. <br>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Can I "opt out " of certain disclosures?</b></p>
                        <p>You may have received notices from other organizations 
                          that allow you to "opt out" of certain disclosures. 
                          The most common type of disclosure that applies to "opt 
                          outs" is the disclosure of personal information 
                          to a non-affiliated company so that company can market 
                          its products or services to you. As a health plan, we 
                          must follow many federal and state laws that prohibit 
                          us from making these types of disclosures. Because we 
                          do not make disclosures that apply to "opt outs," 
                          it is not necessary for you to complete an "opt 
                          out" form or take any action to restrict such disclosures.</p>
