                          security of electronic transmissions via the Internet

                          taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others 
                          have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity 
                          of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed. 
                          Regence will respect your request not to be contacted
