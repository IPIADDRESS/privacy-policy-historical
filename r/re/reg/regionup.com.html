			<dl class="mt20">
				<dt class="b">Disclosure of Personal Information</dt>
				<dd class="ml1em">We do not sell or rent Your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties to You. We use other third parties to provide web analytics on our Website. When You sign up for RegionUP, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Website, that information does not contain Personal Information.

				<dd class="ml1em">Our basic registration forms require Users to provide contact information, including full name, email address, and career-related information. We use this information to contact You about the services on our Website in which You have expressed interest. Should You choose to purchase services, Your credit card information will be stored by our third party payment processor. We use Your credit card information for billing purposes only. If we have trouble processing Your order, we will use Your contact information to contact You.<br><br>
				Sensitive information such as credit card information will be kept completely private by our third party payment processor.<br><br>
				Resumes: By registering on this website and providing us with your personal contact details and resume, You expressly consent to the collection and use of this personal information in accordance with this policy. <br><br>
				When your profile is activated for search, your resume is viewable by recruiters.  A recruiter, whether a direct hiring company or 3rd party recruiter may obtain your contact details provided during your registration by clicking on your profile and downloading your contact number. By activating your profile and making it searchable, you hereby consent to provide your contact details to recruiters using the Website.<br><br>
				We do our best to ensure that the ability to contact individuals in the resume database is restricted to bona-fide clients such as recruiters, hiring managers, and HR professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the resume database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your resume(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of RegionUP may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this resume in these circumstances.<br><br>
				Should you not want to be contacted by potential employers or 3rd party recruiters, you may adjust your privacy settings <a href="/settings/scout/">here</a>.<br><br>
				Should You post a resume, the amount of information You choose to keep confidential is entirely up to Your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as You choose.

				We use other third parties to provide credit card processing services on our Website. When You sign up for Premium membership, we will process Your full payment information including credit cards through a third party payment processor and they may collect some information (e.g., credit card numbers, name) as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using Your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. RegionUP shall not be responsible for any damage, loss or harm to You resulting from Your use of that third party's service.<br><br>
				We post customer reviews on our Website, which may contain Personal Information such as the customer's name. We obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the review to post their name along with their review.<br><br>
