			"Personal Information" means information that would allow a third party to learn Your identity or contact You, including, for example, Your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.<br><br>
			Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we collect, use and protect Your Personal Information. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify You in accordance with the process described in the Terms of Use.

			</dl>
			<dl class="mt20">
				<dt class="b">Disclosure of Personal Information</dt>
				<dd class="ml1em">We do not sell or rent Your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of marketing the products or services provided by those third parties to You. We use other third parties to provide web analytics on our Website. When You sign up for RegionUP, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service. Although we may disclose aggregated information about the use of our Website, that information does not contain Personal Information.

We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this resume in these circumstances.<br><br>
