<h4>Third Party Access to Your Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
<p> Active will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties other than to provide necessary services to register you for your chosen event (which would include the client whose event you register for and if payment is processed, the payment card entities but subject to payment card industry standards) unless we have your permission or as described in this privacy policy (see “Business Transitions”).  Active will provide you the option to opt-out from any sharing of your personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries or affiliates within the Active family for their promotional use when the information to be shared is collected. </p>

Our service providers are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for their own promotional purposes. </p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

<p> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p>
<p>We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service that uses tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate in order to capture usage and volume statistics. We use this information to improve our Web site and services. </p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to your personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (such as a tracking utility company) use cookies and Web beacons on our sites. We have no access or control of these third party tracking utilities. </p>
<p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
