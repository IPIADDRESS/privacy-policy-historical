      <p> The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong> Information Collection &amp; Uses </strong></p>
      <p><em> Types of Users</em> We have two different types of users of the site and it’s services. The type of user you are will determine the collection and use policies of your information. The first type is a client. A client is a RegOnline customer that is using the services we provide to create a registration form for an event. They are a company or an individual using the software and services from RegOnline to run and manage an event. The other type of user is an attendee. An attendee is a person signing up for an event through a registration page created by our services and software by a client. The types of information collected and the use of that information is detailed below. </p>
      <p><em> Attendee information collected by RegOnline</em> All attendee data that is collected and maintained through our service is solely owned by the client, and we have no rights to sell or use the information provided. The client, not RegOnline, is responsible for what information is collected and required on the registration forms. We will provide and maintain the secure storage of all information collected from the attendee and will not sell, use or rent the information collected to any third party. </p>
      <p><em> Client information collected by RegOnline </em><strong></strong> Clients purchasing service through RegOnline will be required to provide certain personally identifiable information. This will include personal information (such as name, email, phone, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit number and expiration date). This information from clients is collected when a client signs up for a live demo, opens a new account, or calls and starts a new account over the phone. </p>
      <p> The information collected is used for billing purposes and to send orders to the client or other involved third parties. If we have trouble relaying the order or the client cannot fill an order, the information provided will be used to contact the client. RegOnline does not share, rent, or sell this information to any third parties. </p>
      <p><em> Attendee information collected by client’s registration pages</em> Attendee information that is collected by RegOnline’s service is the sole property of the client. The client will decide what information will be required and collected as well as how they will use the information. RegOnline is responsible for safe and secure storage of all information collected but will not have any rights to sell or use the information provided. </p>
      <p><em> Surveys </em> From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information (such as demographic information, e-mail, phone, and address) from you. Participation in these surveys are completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. </p>
      <p> We use the information gathered in the survey to better personalize our service, improve the ease-of-use of our website, or to get customer feedback on changes or improvements that we have made. These surveys are conducted in-house. We will not share the personally identifiable information provided through your survey with any other third party unless we give you prior notice and choice. </p>
      <p><em> Tell-A-Friend</em> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site with a link to our site. RegOnline does not store this information. The information collected is for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email to visit our site.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><em> Uses of Information</em><br>
  RegOnline offers its online event registration service to clients as a means of collecting and managing attendee and/or vendor registrations. Any information provided on a registration page is the sole property of the client, kept on RegOnline's servers and is accessible only to the authorized client or to RegOnline at the direct request of the authorized client. If an attendee wants to find out how the client will be using their information the attendee should see the client’s privacy statement or contact the client directly. </p>
      <p> RegOnline, under the digression of the client, will use the clients e-mail address provided to send secondary communications such as newsletter to the client. The client can “opt-out” of these secondary communications when they sign up for an account or can be removed from the list by following the instructions on the newsletter in-order to get removed. RegOnline will not use attendee’s information for any secondary communication unless authorized by the client. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong> Communications from the Site</strong></p>
      <p><em> Customer Service</em><br>
  Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will communicate with you in response to your inquiries in order to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. </p>
      <p> We do not share your profile with other third parties. </p>
      <p align="center"><strong> Information Sharing and Disclosure </strong></p>
      <p><em> Choice/Opt-out</em> Attendees providing personally identifiable information will need to refer to the client and their privacy policies regarding the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes (such as newsletters and other marketing materials). We are not responsible for “opt-out” opportunities for attendees as attendee’s personally identifiable information is the sole property of our client. We provide the secure storage and software to obtain the information but will not share or use attendee information for any purpose, unless otherwise indicated by our client. </p>
      <p> Clients submitting their information will have the opportunity to “opt-out” of their personally identifiable information being used to send secondary communications from us, such as newsletters. This option will be available when clients are opening a new account. If you currently receive our newsletter and other secondary communications, clients will have the option to “opt-out” of receiving that material by either following the instructions on the secondary communication material to be taken off the list or clients may <script language="javascript">zrEmail_addy('support','Full','Send an email to us');</script><a href="mailto:support@regonline.com">Send an email to us</a> at <script language="javascript">zrEmail_addy('support','Full','');</script><a href="mailto:support@regonline.com">support@regonline.com</a>. </p>
      <p><em> Co-Branded Relationships</em> We have a co-branded relationship with our clients whereby, clients use the software and service we provide to create an online registration form and all personally identifiable information that attendees enter into these forms is solely owned by the client. The client is the user of the information attendees provide and all attendees should refer to the client directly or the client’s privacy statement for disclosure on use of the submitted information. RegOnline’s role is providing the online registration service and safely maintaining the storage of the information but is not responsible for the client’s use of the information. <strong></strong></p>
      <p><em> Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</em><br>
  We collect aggregated demographic information about our user base. This information does not identify individual users or any of their personal information and is used for our own reports, marketing and customer satisfaction efforts. </p>
      <p> We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. </p>
      <p><em> Personally identifiable information</em><br>
  We DO NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties, except as otherwise indicated in this privacy statement. </p>
      <p><em> Access to Personally Identifiable Information </em> Attendees who have changes to their personally identifiable information or would like to cancel their registration can either log in to the registration page using their ID number (given to the attendee through a confirmation e-mail after registering for an event with a RegOnline client) or can simply type in your email address to the registration form. Either of these entries will bring up the personally identifiable information the attendee has previously entered for that registration form and the attendee will have the option of either updating or canceling their registration. </p>
      <p><em> Agents</em><br>
  We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. </p>
      <p><em> Service Providers</em><br>
  We use other third parties, such as ReadyTalk, to provide web conferencing for our product demos. ReadyTalk is governed by its own unique Privacy Policy. RegOnline is not responsible for any information provided to ReadyTalk when using their service to access RegOnline's web demos. </p>
      <p><em> Legal Disclaimer</em><br>
  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site </p>
