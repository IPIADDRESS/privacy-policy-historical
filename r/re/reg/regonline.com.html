				The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this  Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software  downloaded from the site. <br>
				<strong>Information Collection &amp;  Uses </strong><br>
				<em>Types of Users</em> We have two different types of users of the site and  it’s services. The type of user you are will determine the collection and use  policies of your information. The first type is a client. A client is a  RegOnline customer that is using the services we provide to create a  registration form for an event. They are a company or an individual using the  software and services from RegOnline to run and manage an event. The other type  of user is an attendee. An attendee is a person signing up for an event through  a registration page created by our services and software by a client. The types  of information collected and the use of that information is detailed below. <br>
				<em>Attendee information collected by RegOnline</em> All attendee data that  is collected and maintained through our service is solely owned by the client,  and we have no rights to sell or use the information provided. The client, not  RegOnline, is responsible for what information is collected and required on the  registration forms. We will provide and maintain the secure storage of all  information collected from the attendee and will not sell, use or rent the  information collected to any third party. <br>
				<em>Client information collected by RegOnline </em>Clients purchasing  service through RegOnline will be required to provide certain personally  identifiable information. This will include personal information (such as name,  email, phone, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit  number and expiration date). This information from clients is collected when a client  signs up for a live demo, opens a new account, or calls and starts a new  account over the phone. <br>
				The information collected is used for billing purposes and to send orders to  the client or other involved third parties. If we have trouble relaying the  order or the client cannot fill an order, the information provided will be used  to contact the client. RegOnline does not share, rent, or sell this information  to any third parties. <br>
				<em>Attendee information collected by client’s registration pages</em> Attendee information that is collected by RegOnline’s service is the sole  property of the client. The client will decide what information will be  required and collected as well as how they will use the information. RegOnline  is responsible for safe and secure storage of all information collected but  will not have any rights to sell or use the information provided. <br>
				<em>Surveys </em>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to  participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will  request certain personally identifiable information (such as demographic  information, e-mail, phone, and address) from you. Participation in these  surveys are completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not  to disclose this information. <br>
				We use the information gathered in the survey to better personalize our  service, improve the ease-of-use of our website, or to get customer feedback on  changes or improvements that we have made. These surveys are conducted  in-house. We will not share the personally identifiable information provided  through your survey with any other third party unless we give you prior notice  and choice. <br>
				<em>Tell-A-Friend</em> If you choose to use our referral service to tell a  friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email  address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him  or her to visit the site with a link to our site. RegOnline does not store this  information. The information collected is for the sole purpose of sending this  one-time email to visit our site.<br>
				<em>Forums </em>If you use the forums on this site, you should be aware that  any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read,  collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send  you unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not  responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in  these forums.<br>
				<em>Testimonials </em><em>From time to time we receive and post testimonials from our valued  customers on our site.&nbsp; We receive  permission to post these testimonials prior to posting on the site. If you  would like your testimonial removed, please contact us at
				<a href="mailto:support@regonline.com">support@regonline.com</a>
				. </em><br>
				<em>Uses of Information</em><br>
				RegOnline offers its online event registration service to clients as a means of  collecting and managing attendee and/or vendor registrations. Any information  provided on a registration page is the sole property of the client, kept on  RegOnline's servers and is accessible only to the authorized client or to  RegOnline at the direct request of the authorized client. If an attendee wants  to find out how the client will be using their information the attendee should  see the client’s privacy statement or contact the client directly. <br>
				RegOnline, under the discretion of the client, will use the clients e-mail  address provided to send secondary communications such as newsletter to the  client. The client can “opt-out” of these secondary communications when they  sign up for an account or can be removed from the list by following the  instructions on the newsletter in-order to get removed. RegOnline will not use  attendee’s information for any secondary communication unless authorized by the  client. <br>
				<strong>Communications from the Site</strong><br>
				<em>Customer Service</em><br>
				Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will  communicate with you in response to your inquiries in order to provide the  services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you  by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. <br>
				We do not share your profile with other third parties except as described in  this privacy statement.&nbsp;
				<br>
				<strong>Information Sharing and  Disclosure </strong><br>
				<em>Choice/Opt-out</em> Attendees providing personally identifiable  information will need to refer to the client and their privacy policies  regarding the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable  information used for certain purposes (such as newsletters and other marketing  materials). We are not responsible for “opt-out” opportunities for attendees as  attendee’s personally identifiable information is the sole property of our  client. We provide the secure storage and software to obtain the information  but will not share or use attendee information for any purpose, unless  otherwise indicated by our client. <br>
				Clients submitting their information will have the opportunity to “opt-out”  of their personally identifiable information being used to send secondary  communications from us, such as newsletters. This option will be available when  clients are opening a new account. If you currently receive our newsletter and  other secondary communications, clients will have the option to “opt-out” of  receiving that material by either following the instructions on the secondary  communication material to be taken off the list or clients may
				<a href="mailto:support@regonline.com">Send an email to us</a>
				at
				<a href="mailto:support@regonline.com">support@regonline.com</a>
				. <br>
				<em>Co-Branded Relationships</em> We have a co-branded relationship with our  clients whereby, clients use the software and service we provide to create an  online registration form and all personally identifiable information that  attendees enter into these forms is solely owned by the client. The client is  the user of the information attendees provide and all attendees should refer to  the client directly or the client’s privacy statement for disclosure on use of  the submitted information. RegOnline’s role is providing the online  registration service and safely maintaining the storage of the information but  is not responsible for the client’s use of the information. <br>
				<em>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</em><br>
				We collect aggregated demographic information about our user base. This  information does not identify individual users or any of their personal  information and is used for our own reports, marketing and customer  satisfaction efforts. <br>
				We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. <br>
				<em>Personally identifiable information</em><br>
				We DO NOT Share Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties, except  as otherwise indicated in this privacy statement. <br>
				<em>Access to Personally Identifiable Information </em>Attendees who have  changes to their personally identifiable information or would like to cancel  their registration can either log in to the registration page using their ID  number (given to the attendee through a confirmation e-mail after registering  for an event with a RegOnline client) or can simply type in your email address  to the registration form. Either of these entries will bring up the personally  identifiable information the attendee has previously entered for that  registration form and the attendee will have the option of either updating or  canceling their registration. <br>
				At the minimum, we will provide a response within 30 days to a request for  access to personally identifiable information collected. <br>
				<em>Agents</em><br>
				We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.  These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable  information for any other purposes. <br>
				<em>Service Providers</em><br>
				We use other third parties, such as ReadyTalk, to provide web conferencing for  our product demos. ReadyTalk is governed by its own unique Privacy Policy.  RegOnline is not responsible for any information provided to ReadyTalk when  using their service to access RegOnline's web demos. <br>
				<em>Legal Disclaimer</em><br>
				We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as  required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our  rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal  process served on our Web site <br>
				<strong>Log Files</strong><br>
				As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically  and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP)  addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,  operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. <br>
				We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to  analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the  site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. <br>
				We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable  information. <br>
				<strong>Cookies &amp; Site Stats</strong><br>
				A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes.

We only use session ID cookies to make it easier  for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your  browser. <br>
				We also use Google Site Stats. This is a tracking feature offered by Google  that works for Google’s ad subscribers. To measure performance, Google uses  small strings of text (known as a cookie) that is placed on your computer when  you click on ads. Cookies typically remain active on your computer for about 30  days. If you visit certain pages of the RegOnline’s website during that period,  Google and the RegOnline will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by  Google. We only use this type of cookie to see how effective our advertising is  on Google’s website and will not link any information stored in the cookies to  any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website. <br>
				Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers, service providers,  tracking utility companies) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or  control over these cookies. <br>
				This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does  not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.<br>

				<strong>Security</strong><br>
				The security of your personal information is important to us. When logged in  to an event management section or registering for an event, every page you  visit is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology as opposed to  other websites that only encrypt pages with credit card information. <br>

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,  is 100% secure, however.
