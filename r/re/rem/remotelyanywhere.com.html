			<br>
			<p>3am Labs, Inc. ("3am Labs"), respects your privacy and is committed to protect 
			the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through 
			our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your 
			personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to 
			provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and 
			use your personal information.</p>
			
			<span class="intxtheader" style="background-color:#DEF0FA; width: 100%">Information Collection</span><br>
			<br>
			<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, 
			including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, telephone number 
			a home, postal or other physical address, birth date, gender, occupation, a valid credit 
			card number to process payment for products and/or services and such other information

			<p>As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information can be passively collected 
			(that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various 
			technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection 
			(log files, server logs, clickstream). Your internet browser automatically transmits to this 
			site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the web site you just came from 
			and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently 
			using. This site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies 
			and internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is 
			sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site might not work 
			without cookies.</p>

			basis or purchase a license or an upgrade. 3am Labs only uses such information if it has 
			been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy 
			and applicable laws.</p>
			
			<p>Notice: When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection 
			the purpose for the collection. We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of 
			receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have 
			given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy 
			unless you take affirmative action to opt out at the point of collection. Opt-out is the 
			means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information 
			for the purposes covered by the opt-out choice. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide 
			you with the opportunity to "opt in". This means we will require your affirmative action to
