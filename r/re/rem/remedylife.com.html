  <p><strong><u>MediZine Privacy Policy</u></strong></p></div>
    <span class="style1">This Privacy Policy applies to consumers who have agreed
    to receive promotional emails from MediZine, LLC ("MediZine").&nbsp; By
    continuing to receive such promotional emails, you consent to the collection
    and use of information by MediZine as outlined in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    MediZine practices permission-based marketing, and is committed to respecting
  and protecting your privacy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy will help you understand
  how and the extent to which MediZine collects, uses and safeguards the Personal
  Information (defined below) that you have provided.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Personal Information MediZine Collects From You</strong><br>
  <br>
  If you are receiving MediZine publications and promotional email messages,
  this is due to your having returned a business reply card to MediZine upon
  which you included certain Personal Information (defined below) and indicated
  your interest in receiving such communications.&nbsp; For purposes of this
  Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean information that
  can be used to identify you, including, but not limited to: (a) a first and
  last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and
  name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address; or (d) a telephone number.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How MediZine Uses Personal Information</strong><br>
  <br>
  MediZine may use your Personal Information to send email communications to
  you, including email communications sent on behalf of its advertisers and other
  partners.&nbsp; If you indicated your interest in receiving health or medical
  information from third parties, then MediZine may share your Personal Information
  with such third parties.&nbsp; MediZine does not share your Personal Information
  with any third parties other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;MediZine
  may use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as performing
  market analysis and analyzing and managing its business.<br>
  <br>
  MediZine may provide subscriber information in aggregate, de-identified form
  (i.e., in a manner that the data cannot be traced back to you) to its advertisers
  and other parties. <br>
  <br>
  MediZine may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Data
  where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process (for example,
  MediZine may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized
  civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), to protect the security or integrity
  of its databases or the Website, to protect MediZine’s business or reputation,
  to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition
  (see below), to protect and defend the rights or property of MediZine, for
  required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or
  complaints with respect to your use of the Website.<br>
  <br>
  MediZine may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain
  functions on its behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail,
  information technology support, maintaining and removing duplicate information
  from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents
  performing these limited functions on MediZine’s behalf shall have access
  to its users’ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions
  for MediZine but are not permitted to use your Personal Information for other
  purposes.&nbsp; All MediZine contractors operate under federal and state laws
  regarding consumer privacy.<br>
  <br>
  Business Transitions<br>
  <br>
  In the event MediZine goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
  acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
  your Personal Data might be among the assets transferred. <br>
  <br>

  the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the
  same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Website; and/or
  (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers,

  track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other
  information on a Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website
  page that are used to transparently collect information. MediZine may use action
  tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner
  ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products
