   On-line Privacy Policy</p>
   </font><font face="Verdana" size="4"></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
   <p>Your right to on-line privacy is of utmost importance. We recognize that when you choose to disclose information about yourself, you trust
   Remington to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we
   have put a policy in place to better explain how we protect your personal information.</p>
   <p>This policy covers Remington’s family of corporate and subsidiary web sites, which include <a href="http://www.remington.com/">www.remington.com</a>,
   <a href="http://www.stren.com/">www.stren.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.rempac.org/">www.rempac.org</a>. By visiting these sites
   you are under no obligation to provide any information to Remington except when necessary to receive requested products or services. We encourage
   you to take the time to read this privacy policy and those of any web site you visit.</p>
   <p>We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. As part of our commitment to your privacy we have outlined what information we
   gather from our web site users and how we use that information. Below is a summary of Remington’s on-line privacy policy.</p>
   </font><b>
   </b><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Information we collect</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
   In general, when you visit our web sites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this
   information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.</font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
   <p>There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, to adjust our web site
   to your personal preferences, to send to you via e-mail or postal mail newsletters, new product announcements or other information that we feel may
   be of value to you, and for other similar business purposes. Some examples of information our web sites collect are name, address, e-mail address
   and the services that you request. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive future materials from us. If you sign up for a Remington
   electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list.</p>
   <p>All opinions, ideas, suggestions, and other feedback submitted through our web sites may be used by Remington, without any restriction and free
   of charge, and nothing contained in this policy shall limit or otherwise affect this.</p>
   <p>Please note that Remington will fully cooperate with any court order or other legal process and will provide your personal information to the
   extent required in any legal proceeding.</p>
   </font><b>
   </b><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Protecting your privacy</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
   Remington will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information
   in storage. Access to personally identifiable information is limited only to individuals needing such access to perform their job function. All of
   our web sites that collect information will process and store that information in databases located in the United States.</font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
   <p>We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide
   your name and delivery address to third parties that Remington uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., a shipping
   company or fulfillment house if you have asked us to send something to you).</p>
   <p>Our web sites do provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies
   posted on these third party sites and any other sites that you visit. Additionally, the existence of any hyperlink does not imply that Remington
   endorses the linked company, product or service.</p>
   </font><b>
   </b><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Children's privacy</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
   None of the web sites covered by this policy knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13. If we discover that
   a child under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems.</font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
   <p>Remington encourages parents to go online with their children. Parents should understand the sites their kids are visiting and which sites are
   appropriate. There are parental control tools available such as browsers and filtering software that prevent children from accessing inappropriate
   sites. Children should never give out personal information on the Internet, such as name, address, phone number, or name of school, unless
   supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Look for a privacy policy on a web site and find out how information collected from children is
   treated. Parents should teach their children to look for sites that display a privacy policy.</p>
   </font><b>
   </b><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000000">Use of cookies</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>

   what areas of the web site are of interest to our visitors. This information gathered in our log files is not linked to any personally identifiable

   choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our web sites.</p>
