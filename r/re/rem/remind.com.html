COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“under-13 users”). Remind relies on a teacher, school, or school district to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to under-13 users. Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an under-13 user’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the under-13 user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to provide notice to the child’s parent or guardian that we may contact the under-13 user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services. If Remind does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period, the under-13 user will not be able to receive any messages and <strong>his/her Personal Information will be deleted</strong>. If an under-13 user’s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind’s policy is to delete the Personal Information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an under-13 user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an under-13 user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it. If you believe that an under-13 user may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:report@remindhq.com">report@remindhq.com</a>. </p> <p> In order for an under-13 user to gain access to additional features or services, Remind may employ one or more methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission for verifying parental consent. </p> </div> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> Remind collects limited Personal Information from children under-13, and we rely on a teacher, school or district to obtain the consent of each child’s parent when collecting this information.

Like many websites, Remind uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better. </p> <p> A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our agents) may use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Remind. </p> <p> Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with Remind. </p> <p> Remind uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories: </p> <h3>Authentication and security</h3> <ul> <li> <p> To log you into Remind. </p> </li> <li> <p> To protect your security. </p> </li> <li> <p> To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Remind’s policies. </p> </li> </ul> <p> For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Remind and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. </p> <h3>Preferences</h3> <p> To remember information about your browser and your preferences. </p> <p> For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with Remind content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Remind. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws. </p> <h3>Analytics and research</h3> <p> To help us improve and understand how people use our Services. </p> <p> For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Remind by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this. </p> <p> Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by anyone other than Remind is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over those cookies. </p> </div> <section class="terms-privacy--simple-exp column---1-3 column---desktop-1"> <h5>What this is saying</h5> <p> Cookies are bits of information that tell us you’ve visited Remind before and help the browser remember things about you (such as your language setting).

Other users may attend a school or school district that contracts with Remind for use of Remind’s Plans and this may automatically create an account for all the students, teachers, parents and relevant administrators of that school or district and associate their accounts with the school or district. </p> <p> By associating your account with an Organization, you acknowledge and agree that a verified Organization administrator, principal, technology specialist, or other party authorized by the school or organization (such as Organizers associated with the same Organization) may be able to view your User Submissions (including your Personal Information and messaging content but not your personal contact information). In addition, verified Organization administrators and Organizers, and school or district administrators may be able to make administrative changes to your account, such as, adding, removing, or moving you from classes and/or groups, sending messages on your behalf, and more. </p> <p> If you are an Organizer affiliated with an Organization, you acknowledge that Remind may enable other users who are associated with the same Organization to contact you—for example, teachers, students, or parents who are associated with your Organization may communicate with you.
