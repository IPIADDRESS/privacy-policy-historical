COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“under-13 users”). Remind relies on a teacher, school, or school district to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to under-13 users. Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an under-13 user’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the under-13 user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to provide notice to the child’s parent or guardian that we may contact the under-13 user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services. If Remind does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period, the under-13 user will not be able to receive any messages and <strong>his/her Personal Information will be deleted</strong>. If an under-13 user’s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind’s policy is to delete the Personal Information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an under-13 user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an under-13 user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it.
