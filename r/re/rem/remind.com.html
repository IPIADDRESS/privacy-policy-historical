                <p>
                  This Privacy Policy explains how Remind collects and uses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”). References to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy shall apply to personal information of individual users of the Services. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Remind’s treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to Remind through a third party website or service using a Remind application. This policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that we do not own or control.

                  Here’s what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while you’re using Remind. This policy doesn’t cover 3rd party companies that we don’t control but who help us operate our service. Keep reading, there’s more about this later!

                <h3>How is children’s personal information treated?</h3>
      
                <p>
                  We have included some information below related to the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“under age users”). Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an underage user’s name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Remind Services, and we may collect the underage user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to provide notice to parents that we may contact their underage user for the purpose of providing the Services. If Remind does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period, the underage user will not be able to receive any messages and
                  <strong>his/her personally identifiable information will be deleted.</strong>
                  If an underage user’s Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an underage user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an underage user has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that an underage user may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at
                  <a href="mailto:report@remind.com">report@remind.com</a>.

                <p>
                  Remind collects limited personal information from users under 13, and notifies a parent or guardian when collecting personal information from users under 13 years old. We will delete their personal information if the child’s account does not have an associated email address from a parent or guardian, or if the account has been inactive for at least 12 months. Any questions or concerns? Just email us!

                  When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services. Remind will not share personal contact information between Organizers and Subscribers (as those terms are defined in
                  <a href="/terms-of-service">Remind’s Terms of Service</a>) without user permission. The information we gather from users enables us to verify user identity and allows our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services, and helps us personalize and improve our services. We retain such information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

                  Information you provide to Remind by creating an account (or when joining a class) is used to operate our service. For example, we use this information to verify user identity and help users create an account on Remind.

                  We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way.

For underage users, we collect a name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number, and that underage user’s parent’s email address, to provide notice to parents regarding the service. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

                  We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Services. Remind automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Remind cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as your activity on the Services, the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). None of this information constitutes Personal Information. Certain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID and phone number, will be treated as Personal Information.

                <p>
                  We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from such automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site. We may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners’ services as well as the Services.

                  When users use our mobile application, we automatically collect IP address, device ID, device type, what OS users are running. If you create an account through an SMS invitation, we may ask you for your mobile phone number (even if you already have signed up for the Services through a different mechanism such as your browser).

                  We collect users’ IP addresses whenever they use our mobile application, which provides us with a coarse approximation of the user’s location at the city level in order for Remind to, for example:

                <p>
                  We also may, with your express consent, request more specific location information in order to provide you with more relevant information (such as nearby classes or relevant groups to which you may subscribe to). We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We may also collect location-based information from users as part of providing the Services and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the user’s jurisdiction.

                  Remind does not automatically collect or store phone numbers of first-time underage users unless he/she has previously used the Services over SMS and we have notified his/her parent; however, if the underage user has properly signed up for the Services through SMS and then downloaded the Services mobile application, Remind will have the underage user’s phone number and may use it:

                <p>
                  If you provide us your email address or phone number, Remind may send you administrative messages (such as updates, Notifications, newsletters, and other news) relating to the Services or to respond to communications from you. By maintaining a Remind account and/or not opting out of the receipt of information from Remind, you acknowledge and agree that you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile communications device from Remind and/or its Agents (as defined below). The receipt of such messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program. We only send these types of communications to underage users upon providing notice to the parent. If you no longer wish to receive administrative email messages from Remind you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each message or by emailing us at
                  <a href="mailto:contact@remind.com">contact@remind.com</a>. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.

                <h3>What about cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?</h3>
      
                <p>
                  Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites, Remind uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or our Agents) may use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain of web or email content on our Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Remind.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with Remind.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Remind uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:
                </p>
      
                <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                  <li>
                    <h4>Authentication and security:</h4>
      
                    <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          To log you into Remind.
                        </p>
                      </li>
      
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          To protect your security.
                        </p>
                      </li>
      
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the Remind Rules.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
      
                    <p>
                      For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Remind and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our Services.
                    </p>
                  </li>
      
                  <li>
                    <h4>Preferences:</h4>
      
                    <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                      <li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences.</li>
                    </ul>
      
                    <p>
                      For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide you with Remind content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Remind. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.

                    <h4>Analytics and research:</h4>
      
                    <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                      <li>To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.</li>
                    </ul>
      
                    <p>
                      For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Remind by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
      
                <p>
                  Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ features without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

                  All users have the choice of associating their account with a school or other organization. This may be required (for example) for teachers and may be either required or strongly encouraged for other types of Organizers (as defined in the

By doing so, you are aware that an administrator, principal, technology specialist, or other party authorized by the school or organization may be able to view your Content upon proper validation of such person’s credentials. As an Organizer, you also acknowledge that Remind may enable other persons who are associated with the same organization to contact each other -- for example, teachers, students, or parents who are associated with the same school or district. By associating your account with an organization, those persons may be able to view Content already in the account as well as future submissions and Content. Remind will endeavor to notify Organizers (and/or relevant Subscribers) upon making that Content available. In addition, these persons may be able to make administrative changes to your account, such as, but not limited to, adding subscribers, removing subscribers, sending messages on your behalf and more. They will not be able to delete Content already submitted.

Some examples of services for which we may use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, and providing user services.
