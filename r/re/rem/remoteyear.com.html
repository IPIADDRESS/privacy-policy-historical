These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” &nbsp;Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. Advertisements served through the Remote Year Platform may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on (i) anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age); (ii) Remote Year Platform usage patterns or (iii) user activity on third party services. We do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Remote Year Platform. To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Remote Year Platform. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You can opt out of certain types of targeted advertising as further described in the section below titled ‘Your Rights.’</p></li><li><p class="p-policy"><strong>aggregate information:</strong> we collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Remote Year Platform (“<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>”).
