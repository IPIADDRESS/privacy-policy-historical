<br><br>
Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information
<br>
In general, we collect and use information about you deliver benefits (e.g., our newsletter) and to inform you of Remilon-related conferences, benefits and/or other opportunities. Except as described herein, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share or disclose your private, personally identifiable information to third parties.

<br><br>

<br>
If you correspond with us via email, the postal service, or other form of communication, we may retain such correspondence and the information contained therein and use such to respond to your inquiry.
