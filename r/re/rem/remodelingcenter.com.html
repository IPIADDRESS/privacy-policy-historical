      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meredith cares about protecting 
        the privacy of children. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide 
        us any personally identifying information. Children should always get 
        permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves 
        (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, 
        to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's 
        online experience, and to share your interest in our sites with your young 
        ones. If you're under 13, please do not register with any of our sites 
        or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your 
        name, your email address or your phone number).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="information"></a>INFORMATION 
        WE COLLECT:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information we gather on 
        our sites falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you 
        register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information collected 
        as you navigate through our sites. Third-party providers featured on, 
        or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products and services 
        offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Personally Identifying 
        Information</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Registration Information.</b> 
        To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you 
        register, we collect personally identifying information about you, including 
        your name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We 
        may also ask for some additional information, such as, hobbies, age, browser 
        type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing this 
        information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our 
        sites, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including 
        when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a 
        problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process your 
        orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful 
        to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Contests and Other Promotions. 
        </b>From time to time, we may offer contests or other promotions involving 
        marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one 
        of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information 
        about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). We may 
        share this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional 
        partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for 
        example, in the contest rules). We don't control these third parties' 
        privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection 
        and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy policies 
        and learn how they will use your information before participating. If 
        you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with 
        a promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do 
        not participate in the promotion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>Tracking Information</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cookies. </b>To help us 
        serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes to track 
        user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your 
        browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A 
        cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites to identify your 
        computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your user name 
        and password (if you are a registered visitor) so you don't have to re-enter 
        that information each time you visit one of our sites. We also use cookies 
        to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our 
        sites. The help function on most browsers contains information on how 
        to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable 
        cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may not be 
        able to take advantage of various features on our sites that are available 
        to other visitors. In addition, our advertising and marketing partners 
        may use their own cookies. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Third Party Advertising 
        Services.</b> We use the services of DoubleClick, a third-party advertising 
        and email delivery company to serve and target advertisements that you 
        see on the pages of our sites, to serve and target promotions or other 
        marketing messages, and to send e-mails from us. DoubleClick also collects 
        "clickstream data," information about your visit to our sites and to third-party 
        sites, that can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and 
        other sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes. 
        This clickstream data does not include personally identifying information 
        such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. DoubleClick 
        uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects information 
        directly from our users. We share website usage information about visitors 
        to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with DoubleClick 
        to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information 
        used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick note 
        some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags 
        (also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know 
        more about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, 
        please see the privacy statement on the DoubleClick website (<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Browser Level Information 
        and IP Addresses.</b> When you use our sites, we may also collect information 
        about your access time and your computer configuration, including the 
        type of browser software you use, the operating system that you're running, 
        the resolution of your computer monitor and your Internet Protocol ("IP") 
        address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected 
        to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web 
        pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us 
        who you are. Like the IP address, none of the other information described 
        in this paragraph identifies you personally. We collect this information 
        for purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity that we, and our 
        advertisers, may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average 
        user spends on our site, which pages or features get the most attention, 
        and the like. The aggregated information helps to understand our audience 
        and confirm the value of advertising on our websites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="howyour"></a>HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL 
        BE USED: </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our primary goal in collecting 
        information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting 
        our sites and to make our sites more valuable to you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Vendors and Service Providers.</b> 
        To make your experience on our sites more useful and enjoyable, we may 
        offer some features (such as chat rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction 
        with third party providers ("Provider Partners") that specialize in operating 
        such services. We share with each of these Provider Partners such information 
        as is necessary to provide you with the services we provide you in conjunction 
        with that Provider Partner. Their use of this information will be subject 
        to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find 
        on their websites.<i> We will not provide your email address to such third 
        parties unless it's necessary to provide the services you have requested, 
        or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion. </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Sites to Which We Link. 
        </b>We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to 
        products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies 
        we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products 
        or services or conduct other transactions through our websites, use of 
        any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator 
        of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. 
        When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services 
        through our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed 
        by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even 
        if it appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction. 
        The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find 
        the privacy policy of any of our providers via a link either from the 
        site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are 
        offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Shopping.</b> When you are 
        ready to make a purchase through one of our sites, we will ask you to 
        provide us with certain information, including your contact details (such 
        as your name, address, telephone and email), and your billing information 
        (such as your credit card number and the date that your card expires). 
        We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction 
        and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share 
        this information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to 
        facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, 
        fulfillment and billing purposes). We may share non-financial information 
        with such merchants in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Our Affiliates</b>. When 
        you register for one of our sites, the information that you provide will 
        be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you will simultaneously 
        be registered for our other sites as well. We may share the information 
        that we collect from you with any wholly or majority-owned subsidiary 
        of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services that 
        we may believe may be of interest to you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Postal Address Lists</b>. 
        If you provide us with your postal address, we may include that address 
        in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties. If you 
        would like us to stop including your postal address in such lists, please 
        send us a letter (which should be addressed to Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out 
        Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309), 
        requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists. If we 
        receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible to 
        remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell 
        or rent to third parties.</font></p>

              </b>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Newsletters.</b> We 
              may offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters 
              on various topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors. 
              If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you can always 
              unsubscribe later either (1) by following the 'unsubscribe' link 
              located near the bottom of each newsletter, or (2) by going to <a href="http://www.bhg.com/bhg/myaccount">My 
              Account</a>, selecting "Unsubscribe" from the Newsletter options, 
              unchecking the relevant boxes and pressing the "Update" button.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Promotional Emails.</b> 
              If you provide us with your email address, from time to time we 
              may send you emails about Meredith products, services and special 
              offers (such as special Meredith magazine subscription offers) that 
              we believe may be of interest to you. When you register, you will 
              also be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to 
              receive emails about products, services and special offers from 
              third-party providers. Though we hope that you will find both types 
              of promotional emails helpful, if you decide that you no longer 
              wish to receive either or both types of emails, please go to the 
              <a href="http://www.bhg.com/bhg/profile/member/optout/">Email Preferences</a> 
              page and update your preferences. Of course, you may change your 
              preferences at any time. We will make any changes you request as 
              quickly as we can.</font></p>
