<p class="intercom-align-left">This Policy applies only to the Site and the Services. We do not exercise control over third party services or other websites that provide information, or over banners, other advertisements or links from within the Site or the Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer’s browser, collect data or solicit personal information from you.

<p class="intercom-align-left">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Information Sharing and Disclosure</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Disclosure by You of Information of Other Users.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">The sending of unwanted messages from one user to another is strictly forbidden. Personal Information of another user obtained through your use of the Site or the Services may be used by you only for the purpose for which such Personal Information was provided to you and strictly in accordance with the Terms of Service and this Policy, or otherwise subject to such user’s prior written consent.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Your Submissions.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">As a professional profile and networking platform, part of Your Information, including without limitation content of your profile, is published to the public Internet and visible to unregistered visitors to the Site. &nbsp;This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. &nbsp;Further, nothing shall restrict our right to use, access, process, collect, disclose, share or distribute any Public Data, even if such Public Data is duplicative of your Contact Data.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission on the Site or the Services will be publicly available and should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions. If you disclose your Personal Information to others, whether or not they are users of the Site, on our Site or through the Services or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them.</p>

<p class="intercom-align-left">If you have opted to link your Account to your Social Media account, you can easily share content from the Services to these third party services, in accordance with your Account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective policies of these third parties. &nbsp;If you connect your Account with one of these services, you may be giving such third party service access to your Personal Information or Contact Data.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Service Providers.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate or enhance the Services (for example, we share parts of Your Information with service providers in order to facilitate data associations and to create a more complete data record of your contacts), to provide the Services on our behalf (such as payment processing), to assist us in analyzing how the Services is used, and to perform services related to administration of the Services or the Site (including, without limitation, maintenance, payments, hosting and database management services, website analytics and administration). &nbsp;We may share Your Information, including your Personal Information and Content Data, with such third party service providers, so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf. While these third party service providers may not sell Your Information, they may use Your Information, including your Contact Data, to make associations between data elements that constitute Public Data (e.g., email address, twitter handle or Facebook username) and disclose these data elements to their end users even if the association was previously undisclosed. For example, if a person has a twitter handle, an email address and a Facebook page, all of which constitute Public Data, and the part of Your Information shared with them includes the data association to tie those three elements of Public Data together, such third party may disclose that connection. They are obligated to comply with this Policy and may not use Your Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Non-Personal Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.</p>

Among other things, linking this information may allow us generally to improve and personalize the Site and the Services. If we combine or link any information with your Personal Information, the resulting combination will be treated as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Policy or the Terms of Service; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to user comments or service inquiries; (5) protect the our rights, property, or safety and the rights, property and safety of the Services, our users or the public; or (6) prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.</p>
