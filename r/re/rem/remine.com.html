				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>Last Updated: September 2016</p>
			</center>
			
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information that Remine, LLC (the “<u>Company</u>,” “<u>we</u>,” or “<u>us</u>” or “<u>our</u>”) collects or receives through its website http://www.remine.com (“<u>Website</u>”), and from our interactions through [telephone, correspondence, electronic communications, newsletters, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and] the services (“<u>Services</u>”) that we provide through our web-based application (including all related documentation, the “<u>Application</u>”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect the personal information of Authorized Users and visitors (each defined below), and outlines the choices of Authorized Users and visitors regarding the collection and use of their personal information.</p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement located at <a href="http://legal.remine.com/terms">http://legal.remine.com/terms</a>.</p>
			<h3>1 Consent to Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>In this Privacy Policy, we describe the information we collect when an individual (“visitor”, “you” or “your”) uses or accesses our Website or Application, or otherwise engages with the Company. By accessing or using the Website or Application, you consent to the information collection, disclosure and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, please read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

			<p>2.1 We collect information from a visitor when she or he accesses or interacts with the Website or Application. We collect both personal information and non-personal information depending on the level of interaction of a visitor with the Website or Application.

			<p>2.2 Information you provide to us directly:</p>
			<p>a. <em>Registration Information: </em> We collect the information that a visitor provides to us when activating an account. This includes identifying information about a visitor, such as name, password, [mailing address, phone number,] and email address. A visitor who has activated their account and who has used a password to access the Application is deemed an “<u>Authorized User</u>”. All provisions of this Privacy Policy that apply to a “visitor” also apply to an “Authorized User”. Some provisions apply only to Authorized Users.</p>
			<p>b. <em>Payment Information:</em> The Website provides the ability to make online payments for access to certain Services. However, we do not directly access, collect, or store your credit card information. All credit card information and other customer details required to process credit card payments are collected directly by our service provider that processes online payments on our behalf. Our service provider processes this information in line with its own privacy policy and data handling practices. We are not responsible for the handling of this payment information by the service provider.</p>
			<p>c. <em>Electronic Communications: </em> We may collect information that a visitor or Authorized User chooses to share with us via electronic communications, such as support or administrative requests. We use this information to understand and respond to a visitor’s questions and to improve our processes and customer experience.</p>
			<p>d. <em>Surveys and Questionnaires: </em> We may invite visitors and Authorized Users to participate in surveys or to respond to a particular questionnaire. Participation in such surveys and questionnaires is voluntary, but may require that a visitor provide certain personal information, such as name, email address, or zip code. We will use this information for analytics purposes.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>a. <em>In general: </em>We record a visitor’s and Authorized Users IP address, the time of the visit, and information regarding the browser and operating system of the device used. We collect certain information about a the use of the Website, including actions taken on the Website, webpages visited, and time spent on specific webpages, and the like.</p>
			<p>b. <em>Mobile Device Users: </em>If a mobile device is used to access the Website or Application, we may collect, in addition to the general information above, the type of mobile device used and other technical information about the mobile device (e.g., the manufacturer of the mobile device, its location, and etc.).&nbsp;</p>

			<p>You may choose to block certain categories of cookies. Most browsers contain settings that allow you to control or delete cookies. These settings will typically be found in the “options” or “preferences” menu of your browser. Please note that blocking or disabling certain cookies may interfere with certain functionalities of our Service. Further, while disabling a cookie may prevent the future collection of information by that cookie, it does not prevent the use of the information collected prior to the cookie being disabled. For more general information about cookies you can visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
			<p>b. <em>Embedded Scripts:</em> Embedded scripts are used to collect information about a visitor’s and Authorized User’s interactions with the Website and Application, such as the links clicked. Embedded scripts are temporarily downloaded onto a visitor’s or Authorized User’s computer or mobile device and are deactivated or deleted when a visitor or Authorized User disconnects from the Website.</p>
			<p>c. <em>Third-Parties' Content and Widgets: </em>Our Website may include third-party widgets and other content from third-parties. These third-parties may use their own cookies or web beacons to track the actions of visitors online over time and across different websites or platforms to deliver targeted electronic advertisements to a visitor.

			<p>11.2 Do Not Track: Browsers provide the ability to inform operators of online services that a visitor does not want certain information about his/her online activities to be collected over time or across websites or online services. However, the Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what “do not track” means, on how compliance with “do not track” would be measured or evaluated or on a common approach to responding to a “do not track” signal. Consequently, due to this lack of standardization, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated “do not track” signals.
