        1.1&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Collection of
        Information</span><span class="c5">. RIPP.LY collects information from
        you when you voluntarily provide it to RIPP.LY or one of its partners,
        through websites (owned and operated by RIPP.LY or a third party),
        social networking applications, blogs, and other means (together, these
        sources are referenced hereafter as "Publishers") (for example,
        by signing up for an email newsletter or through a co-registration offer on
        a survey), or by other means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
        registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "User
        Form"). In a User Form, RIPP.LY or a third party may offer you
        incentives in exchange for providing information about yourself such as
        name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth
        date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation,
        employment information, and personal and online interests (together,
        "User Information"). Completing the User Form is voluntary and
        you are under no obligation to provide User Information. &nbsp;Information
        about business partners of RIPP.LY, including Publishers and
        advertisers, may be collected through various means in the course of
        conducting business operations, such as through agreements entered into by
        the party and by emails exchanged with those partners (all such information
        being “Business Information”).</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c5">1.2&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Vendor List
        Information</span><span class="c5">. RIPP.LY may obtain information
        about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit
        that party (the "Seller") to share the information, which
        RIPP.LY subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise lawfully
        acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name,
        street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary
        range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment,
        personal and online interests, and other information which you provided to
        the Seller (together, "Vendor List Information"). When acquiring
        Vendor List Information, RIPP.LY requires assurances from the Seller
        that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to
        RIPP.LY and that RIPP.LY may lawfully use the Vendor List
        Information to transmit offers from advertisers.</span></p>

        technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you,
        such as your Internet Protocol address and what Web browser you are using,
        with certain of your online behaviors, such as opening or clicking on a
        particular online advertisement. Additionally, RIPP.LY may use other

        Information").</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c5">(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of
        data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows RIPP.LY
        and/or its partners to identify and associate your IP address with
        corresponding information in RIPP.LY's database. RIPP.LY and/or
        its third party partners may use cookies to track individual responses or
        views of advertisements and activity across different websites over time,

        of interest to you and enable you to receive customized advertisements or
        content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The
        cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data
        you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we

        <p class="c1"><span class="c5">(b) Web beacons. A web beacon is programming
        code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an
        individual's user identification to a database and associate the
