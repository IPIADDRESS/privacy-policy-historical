									<b>Your privacy matters to us<br>
									</b>Welcome to Ribbit. Because we are 
									committed to protecting your privacy in all 
									aspects of our business, we hope you will 
									take the time to read this policy, which 
									explains what information we collect from 
									you and how we use that information. By 
									using our Web site or purchasing products or 
									services from us, you agree to be bound by 
									this policy. If we decide to change our 
									privacy policy, we will post those changes 
									on this page so that you are always aware of 
									what information we collect and how we use 
									it. Please check back periodically!</font><p>

									<b>What information we collect and how we 
									use it</b><br>
									When you visit our Web site, Ribbit does not 
									collects your IP address, which we use to 
									help diagnose problems with our server, to 
									administer our Web site, and to improve our 
									products and services. Your IP address also 
									is used to gather broad demographic 
									information that does not personally 
									identify you.<br>
									<br>
									To request more information about an item, 
									you must provide your e-mail address so that 
									the seller may reply to your question by 
									e-mail. Ribbit is not responsible for the 
									protection of your e-mail address if you 
									contact a Seller.<br>
									<br>
									To order from us you must set up an Ribbit 
									account. Setting up an account requires you 
									to provide your email address and choose a 
									password (your "Account Information"). When 
									you order from us, we also ask for your 
									name, shipping address, telephone number, 
									and your credit card number, billing 
									address, and expiration date (your "Order 
									Information"). This information is necessary 
									for us to process your order, to notify you 
									of your order status, and to fulfill orders. 
									To process and fulfill orders of Seller 
									items that usually ship in 2 to 3 business 
									days to United States and Canadian customers 
									we provide the Seller with your shipping 
									address, but do not provide any more 
									personal information such as your e-mail 
									address or billing information.<br>
									<br>
									If you subscribe to the Ribbit newsletter, 
									we may use your Account Information and 
									Order Information to occasionally notify you 
									about important changes to the Web site, new 
									Ribbit features, or special Ribbit offers 
									you may find useful. If you would rather not 
									receive this information, visit the Your 
									Account page to change your preferences. You 
									always have the ability to change your 
									preferences. If you have chosen to receive 
									this information and change your mind, visit 
									the Your Account page to change your 
									preferences. (Whenever you decide to change 
									your preferences, please make sure to change 
									your preferences for each account or email 
									address you have left with us.)<br>
									<br>
									You may also choose to provide personal 
									information, such as your name and address, 
									when you enter a contest or drawing or 
									participate in a survey. We may use this 
									information the same way we use your Account 
									Information and Order Information.</font></p>

									<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
									<b>How we protect your information</b><br>
									This Web site has security measures in place 
									to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration 
									of the information under our control. . <br>
									<br>
									Ribbit will not share your personal 
									information with third parties unless you 
									have consented to the disclosure or the 
									disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with 
									the law or with legal process, (2) protect 
									and defend our rights and property, (3) 
									protect our customers or users from misuse 
									or unauthorized use of the Ribbit Web site, 
									(4) protect the personal safety or property 
									of our customers or the public, or (5) to 
									fulfill orders of Seller items that usually 
									ship in 2 to 3 business days to United 
									States and Canadian customers.<br>
									<br>
									Ribbit may provide aggregate statistics 
									about our customers, sales, traffic 
									patterns, and related Web site information 
									to third parties, but these statistics will 
									include no personally identifying 
									information. Put simply, we will not tell 
									our business partners that you bought a 
									particular item, but we may tell them how 
									many customers in certain demographic groups 
									bought certain items. </font></p>
									<p>
									<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
									<b>Links to other Web sites</b><br>
									The Ribbit Web site contains links to other 
									sites, operated by third parties, that we 
									think may be of interest to you. Ribbit 
									encourages third parties to follow 
									appropriate privacy standards and policies, 
									but is not responsible for the actions of 
									those parties, the content of their Web 
									sites, or any products or services they may 
									offer.</font></p>

									<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
									<b>Cookies</b><br>
									The Ribbit Web site does not use "cookies," 
									which are small pieces of information that 
									are stored by your browser on your 
									computer's hard drive. Cookies may used by 
									our affiliates or advertisers. Ribbit 
									encourages anyone who uses cookies to follow 
									appropriate privacy standards and policies,

									<b>Children's privacy online</b><br>
									At Ribbit, we understand that children's 
									privacy is important. We do not monitor the 
									age of our user audience. However, if you 
									are under age 13, you should not submit 
									personal identifying information to Ribbit 
									without the consent of your parent or 
									guardian. If you are a parent and want to 
									limit your children's access to material you 
									believe may be harmful to them, you may want 
									to look into commercially available 
									hardware, software and filtering devices. If 
									you are interested in learning about these 
									protections, information is available at
									<a target="_new" href="http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/control.htm">
