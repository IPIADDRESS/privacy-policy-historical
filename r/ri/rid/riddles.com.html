            <p align="left">Information Collection and Use </p>
            <p align="left">Riddles.com is the sole owner of the information 
            collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this 
            information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in 
            this statement. Riddles.com collects information from our users at 
            several different points on our website.</p>
            <p align="left">Cookies</p>
            <p align="left">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard 
            drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in 
            no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on 
            our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply 
            terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user 
            would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
            time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still 
            use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be 
            limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be 
            able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly 
            Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and 
            target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our 
            site. </p>
            <p align="left">Some of our business partners use cookies on our site 
            (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control 
            over these cookies.</p>
            <p align="left">Log Files </p>
            <p align="left">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the 
            site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic 
            information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to 
            personally identifiable information. </p>
            <p align="left">Sharing </p>
            <p align="left">We will share aggregated demographic information with 
            our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal 
            information that can identify any individual person. </p>
            <p align="left">Links</p>
            <p align="left">This web site contains links to other sites. Please be 
            aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
            other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our 
            site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site 
            that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy 
            statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
            </p>
            <p align="left">Surveys &amp; Contests</p>
            <p align="left">From time-to-time our site requests information from 
            users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or 
            contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice 
            whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested 
            may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
            and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact 
            information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. 
            Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
            improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>
            <p align="left">DoubleClick</p>
            <p align="left">We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads 
            when you visit our website. These companies MAY use information (not 
            including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) 
            about your visits to this and all other websites in order to provide 
            advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you 
            would like more information about this practice and to know your 
            choices about not having this information used by these companies, 
            look here; http://doubleclick.com</p>
            <p align="left">Site and Service Updates </p>
            <p align="left">We also send the user site and service announcement 
            updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service 
            announcements, which contain important information about the 
            service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services 
            and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or 
            phone. </p>
            <p align="left">Notification of Changes</p>
            <p align="left">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will 
            post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of 
            what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, 
            if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally 
            identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at 
            the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. 
            Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
            information in this different manner. We will use information in 
            accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was 
            collected. </p>
