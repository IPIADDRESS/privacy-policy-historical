<p>We highly value your privacy and make this policy easily available throughout our site to assist you in understanding the handling of information in the course of using this site.</p>
<h2>Log Files and Cookies</h2>
<p>This website utilizes industry standard analytics packages which gathers limited information on visitors to our website automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files.
