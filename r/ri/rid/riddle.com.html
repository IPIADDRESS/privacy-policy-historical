                <h2>1. General</h2>
<p>We at Riddle Technologies AG (“Riddle”) take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Your privacy is important to us.
  We process your personal data in accordance with the applicable statutory data protection requirements for the following purposes.
  <br>If you have been in contact with Riddle services, for example by responding to a quiz created with our software, we guarantee that we will not collect, store or process any personal data about you. The data we collect is merely “aggregated data”, i.e. a statistical evaluation is made of how often a particular question has been answered with a specific answer. In doing so, Riddle deliberately does not collect any data as to which response came from which user. The services we offer only require anonymous data, so we cannot draw any conclusions about your person.

Personal data is only collected, used and passed on by the provider if this is permitted by law or if the users consent to the data collection.</p>

<p>a) When visiting the website <br>When visiting our website www.riddle.com the browser used on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.

<p>The data mentioned is processed by us for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To ensure a smooth connection of the website,</li>
  <li>To ensure comfortable use of our website,</li>
  <li>To evaluate system security and stability, and</li>
  <li>For further administrative purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above. In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person.</p>
<p>In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website. Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.</p>

  <li>This is legally permissible and, according to Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies on our site. These are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site.</p>
<p>Cookies do not harm your device, do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malicious software. Information is stored in the cookie, which results in connection with the specific terminal used. However, this does not mean that we are immediately aware of your identity. On the one hand, the use of cookies serves to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. For example, we use so-called session cookies to recognise that you have already visited individual pages on our website. These are automatically deleted after leaving our website. In addition, to improve usability, we also use temporary cookies that are stored on your device for a specified period of time. If you visit our site again to take advantage of our services, it will automatically recognise that you have already been with us and what inputs and settings you have made, so you do not have to re-enter them. On the other hand, we use cookies in order to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our offer (see section 5). These cookies allow us to automatically recognise when you visit our site again that you have already been with us. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined time. The data processed by cookies is done for the purposes mentioned in order to safeguard our legitimate interests as well as those of third parties according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or a notice always appears before a new cookie is set. However, disabling cookies completely may mean that you cannot use all features of our website.</p>

<h2>5. Analysis tools</h2>
<p>Tracking tools<br>The tracking measures listed below and used by us are based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. With the tracking measures to be used, we want to ensure the needs-based design and the continuous optimisation of our website. We also use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our offer for you. These interests are to be regarded as justified within the meaning of the aforementioned provision. The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools.</p>
<p>i) Google Analytics</p>
For the purpose of customising and continually optimising our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc.
(https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/) (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter: “Google”). In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies (see section 4)
are used.<br>The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website, includes:
<ul>
  <li>Browser type / version,</li>
  <li>Operating system used,</li>
  <li>Referrer URL (the previously visited page),</li>
  <li>Host name of the accessing computer (IP address),</li>
  <li>Time of server request.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage for the purposes of market research and tailor-made website design. This information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if third parties are commissioned to process this data. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with any other data provided by Google. The IP addresses are anonymised, so that an assignment is not possible (IP masking). You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting the browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case not all features of this website may be fully used. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (https: // tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent the collection by Google Analytics by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be set that will prevent the future collection of your data when you visit this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you must set the opt-out cookie again. For more information about privacy related to Google Analytics, see the Google Analytics Help Center (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/ 6004245? Hl = DE).
</p>
<h2>6. Integration of services and contents of third parties</h2>
<p>Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services such as videos or fonts (collectively referred to as “content”). For the purpose of optimising and economically operating our online offer, we also use the communication service described under 6 b). This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content see the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavour to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as “web beacons"”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web sites, visit time, and other information regarding the use of our online offer.</p>
<p>The following presentation provides an overview of third-party providers as well as their contents, as well as links to their privacy statements, which contain further notes on the processing of data and, in some cases already mentioned here, the possibility of objecting (so-called opt-out):</p>
<p>a) External fonts from: <br> Google LLC, https://www.google.com/fonts („Google Fonts“).  The integration of Google fonts is done by a server query with Google (usually in the US).</p>
<p>Privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, <br> Opt-Out: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/</p>
<p>b) Intercom<br>Integration of the third-party communications service Intercom Inc., San Francisco 55 2nd St, 4th Fl. San Francisco, CA, 94105 USA (“Intercom”). This is an instant messaging service. Integration takes place as part of the framing. Framing is the offering of a third-party content or service within a so-called “frame”. These frames are a “direct window” to the third-party online offer. As a result, all communication within the chatbox happens via an Intercom server (usually in the US). Data collected by Intercom during use will only be processed by Intercom and not supplied to Riddle.</p>

Chargebee is a platform that helps you make recurring payments (Subscriptions and other continuing obligations). It is used especially in the case of online payment services that do not have their own way to handle regular subscription fees.
