<h1 align="center">RINGCENTRAL SERVICE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>We realize how important it is to you to understand what happens to your Personal Information
when you use our RingCentral service.  RingCentral is committed to protecting the privacy of data
that you, the user ("you"), submit to this website or to websites under the operation and control
of RingCentral (as indicated by your ability to access such websites via hyperlinks on
<a href="http://www.ringcentral.com">www.ringcentral.com</a>). To demonstrate this commitment,
RingCentral has adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). Our policy is based on the principles of notice/awareness,
choice/consent, access/participation, and integrity/security in the collection and use
of all information regarding our users and their activities at the
<a href="http://www.ringcentral.com">www.ringcentral.com</a> website and such other websites as are directly accessible via hyperlink
(collectively "Website").  Please review this policy each time you use the Website, as it
is subject to change at any time with or without notice by RingCentral.  Whether or not
RingCentral places notice on the Website indicating that this Privacy Policy has been
modified, it is your obligation to review the Privacy Policy from time to time.
By accessing the Website, you are indicating your agreement to this Privacy Policy.
Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website.</p>

<p><u><b>Notice of Privacy Policy</b></u></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in
connection with the capability to receive and respond to incoming phone calls and faxes
while connected to the Internet, receive, store and access voice messages and faxes, and
place calls or faxes (collectively the "Service").</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy supplements and is incorporated into the RingCentral Terms of Use Agreement
(currently available on the Website at <a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/tou.asp">http://www.ringcentral.com/tou.asp</a>),
and you agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.  RingCentral reserves the right to modify
this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended version on the Website.  By continuing to
use the Service, you agree to the terms of the then-current version of this Privacy Policy.
If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using
the Service.  If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact RingCentral
at <a href="http://www.ringcentral.com/contact.asp">http://www.ringcentral.com/contact.asp</a>.</p>

<p>Information that may be collected based on your use of the Service includes Personal
Information and Non-Personal Information.  "Personal Information" is information that would
allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address,
telephone number, or email address, as well as information that is associated with or linked
to such contact information.  "Non-Personal Information" is information that is not associated
with or linked to the individually identifying contact information of a specific person
including without limitation information about your use of the Service, also referred to
as "Usage Data".  "Aggregate Data" is the combined information collected from all of the
users of the Service, or from subgroups of our users, which does not contain any individually
identifying contact information.  In other words, Aggregate Data is never connected to you
individually.</p>

<p><b>1. What Types of Information Is Collected and Why?</b></p>

<p><b>Personal Information.</b>  You provide certain Personal Information to RingCentral
when you: (a) register and sign up for the Service, (b) log into your account with the
Service, or (c) use the Service, submit forms, or send other information to RingCentral.</p>

<p>RingCentral may also receive Personal Information about you from other users, our
partners, or third parties, who may communicate information to RingCentral about you.</p>

<p><b>Non-Personal Information.</b>  RingCentral collects Non-Personal Information as well.
RingCentral's software and servers also automatically collect Usage Information, which includes,
but is not limited to, your frequency and duration of interaction with the Service.</p>

<p><b>Information collected by Cookies.</b>  RingCentral may also make use of website
"cookies" to help you use the Service more easily and to help RingCentral continuously
improve the Website and the value of the Service to you.  A "cookie" is a small data
file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard
drive to help that website "remember" information about you when you return to that
website, such as the specific web pages you previously visited.  RingCentral's cookies
do not read data off of your hard drive, read cookie files created by other websites,
or track any personal information about you.  RingCentral's cookies do monitor Website
usage, including the collection of IP addresses of visitors to the Website.  RingCentral
does not, however, collect any Personal Information with cookies.  You may have the
option of setting your browser to reject cookies; however, doing so may negatively
impact the performance of the Website or restrict RingCentral in effectively serving
your needs and interests.  The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell
you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify
you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  The Personal
Information and Non-Personal Information allows RingCentral to efficiently and properly
serve you, and to contact you should the need arise in order to respond appropriately to
your requests.</p>

<p>RingCentral may disclose Aggregate Data.  RingCentral may also share your responses

RingCentral may combine statistical results concerning the usage of the Website to prepare
collective profiles of users' activities for RingCentral's internal use.  For example,
RingCentral may track the number of RingCentral users who view certain pages or use certain
features of the Website.  Such information, and other information RingCentral derives from
individual users' information allows RingCentral to continue to grow and to provide you
with high-quality information and service.</p>

<p>Due to legal rules beyond RingCentral's control, RingCentral cannot fully ensure that
your private communications and other Personal Information will not be disclosed to other
third parties.  For example, if RingCentral needs to investigate or resolve possible problems
or inquiries, or if RingCentral receives a subpoena requesting information about you or
communications by or to you, RingCentral can, and you authorize RingCentral to (without
any opportunity by you to challenge the validity of the request or the subpoena), disclose
any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials or the party
serving the subpoena as RingCentral believes necessary or appropriate.</p>

<b><p>5. Privacy Protections for Children</p></b>

<p>RingCentral feels very strongly about protecting the privacy of children and encourages
children to involve their parents in any online activities in which they participate.  In
order to protect the privacy of younger Internet users, children under the age of 18 are
prohibited from registering for the Service.</p>

<p>You can limit the collection and use of different elements of your Personal Information
by not participating in those activities for which RingCentral collects Personal Information.
You may opt out at any time.</p>

use of passwords and through providing personal data.  RingCentral strives to keep your
personally identifiable information accurate. RingCentral will provide you with access
to your information, including online access to your registration data so that you may
view, update or correct your information on the Website.  To protect your privacy and
security, RingCentral will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.  Any links to third-party web

<b><p>8. RingCentral Security Procedures</p></b>

<p>Please keep in mind that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network
can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while RingCentral strives to protect
your Personal Information, RingCentral cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to RingCentral or from the Service, and you do so at your own risk.
Once RingCentral receives your transmission, RingCentral exerts best effort to ensure its
security on RingCentral's systems by implementing industry-standard security measures.</p>

<p>RingCentral may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Privacy
Policy at the Website.  RingCentral encourages you to investigate and ask questions about
disclosing any information to third parties; this is a good practice to follow in all of
your online activities.</p>
