<h4 style="background:white"><span>Last
updated December 07, 2009</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span>This Privacy Policy for www.RingNRock.com outlines
important information regarding the use and disclosure of information collected
via this Website (defined below). RingNRock provides this Privacy Policy to
help users make an informed decision as to whether to use or continue using the
Website. If you have any questions about the RingNRock Service, please see our
full </span><a href="http://www.ringnrock.com/help/index.php?page=faqs"><span>FAQ</span></a><span>, or contact our
Customer Care team at </span><a href="http://www.ringnrock.com/index.php?page=contactus"><span>Contact Us</span></a><span>. &nbsp;If we decide to
change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement
on the home page and on any other place we deem appropriate so that you are
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span>We reserve the right to modify this privacy
statement at any time, so please review it frequently.&nbsp; If we make material
changes to this policy, we will notify you as described above.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS
PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO RINGNROCK OR USE ANY OF
THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES REFERRED TO
IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>This Privacy Policy applies to RingNRock's
collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by RingNRock on its
websites, (collectively, the "Website"), and to RingNRock's other
information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third
parties. RingNRock is not responsible for the information collection or privacy

Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Website </span><a href="http://www.ringnrock.com/help/index.php?page=terms"><span>Terms and Conditions</span></a><span>. Your use of the
Website and any personal information you provide via the Website or through

well as the Terms and Conditions and/or other stated policies.</span></p>

General Data Collection. </span></h2>

<h2><span>Registration
</span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span>In order to use the services on the Website,
you must provide your cell phone number. We use this information to contact you
about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. &nbsp;After you
enter your cell phone number and sign up for a service, we will share your cell
phone number with necessary third parties such as wireless carriers and third
party business partners who verify, for example, your carrier and your ability
to incur charges on your cell phone plan. You have the option to provide
demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us in the “my
library” section of the Website; we encourage you to submit this information so
we can provide you a more personalized experience on our site. You can also
update your information in “my library” by logging in to your account and
updating your information. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.1
Survey Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock collects information from
individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an
individual voluntarily completes a RingNRock survey, order form, or a
registration page either online, or by means of online or offline surveys,
order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a
"Survey"). As used herein, "online" means using the
Internet, including the Website, and related technologies. In the Surveys,
RingNRock or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to
provide various information to RingNRock, which may include his or her name,
email address, street address, zip code, telephone number(s) (including cell
phone number(s) and carrier(s)), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and
content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and
marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online
interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time
(together, "Survey Information"). RingNRock may also collect
information concerning an individual from another source and use that
information in combination with information provided from this Website.
Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no
obligation to provide Survey Information to RingNRock or a Third Party, but an
individual may receive incentives from RingNRock or a Third Party in exchange
for providing Survey Information to RingNRock. </span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.2
Third Party List Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock collects information from
individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and
RingNRock subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the
information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased
information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email
address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone
numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of
the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and
such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller
(together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third
Party List Information, RingNRock seeks assurances from the Seller that the
Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to RingNRock
and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the
individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.3
Other Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>Other occasions when RingNRock obtains
information from individuals include but are not limited to (1) when an
individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive
offered by RingNRock or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests
assistance through RingNRock's customer service department, and/or (3) when an
individual voluntarily subscribes to a RingNRock service (together, "Other
Information").</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.4
Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock currently uses cookie and web
beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an
individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally,
RingNRock may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future
(together, "Technology Information").</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of
data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows
RingNRock to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that
resides in RingNRock's database. You may read more about cookies at </span><a href="http://cookiecentral.com"><span>cookiecentral.com</span></a><span> and elsewhere on the
Internet. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to
use all of the features and functionality of the Website. Our cookies are
linked to your personal information during each individual user session. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming
code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used
to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a
cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired
information about an individual in a database. This allows RingNRock to track
certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to
determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track
online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, RingNRock might
place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third
Party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual
listed in RingNRock's database, visits the baseball website, RingNRock receives
notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and
RingNRock would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is
interested in baseball. RingNRock may thereafter present offers of baseball
related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web
pages, RingNRock also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals
listed in RingNRock's database.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>(c) New Technology. The use of technology on
the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is
RingNRock's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, RingNRock strongly
encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use
of technology.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.5
Outside Information.</span></h4>

<p style="background:white"><span>RingNRock
may receive and supplement information about individuals from Third Parties or
from other sources of information outside of RingNRock including information
located in public databases ("Outside Information").</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.6
Personal Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>As used herein, Personal Information means
any information that can identify an individual, such as name, phone number,
email and address. This may be collected by us through Survey Information,
Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and
Outside Information, and any other information RingNRock gathers or receives
about individuals such as usage data, file transfer data and viewing data.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.7
No Information Collected from Children.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock will never knowingly collect any
personal information about children under the age of thirteen (13). If
RingNRock obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information
about a child under the age of thirteen (13), that information will be
maintained solely for regulatory compliance purposes. RingNRock has designed
this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act ("COPPA").</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>1.8
Log File Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>When users log in to access their account,
our servers may automatically record and archive certain information that
web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include
information vital to validating the user's authorization to access the account.
Information, such as a web request, Internet Protocol (the "IP")
address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and
visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time
spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary
to validate and authorize a user's entry and activity on the Website.</span></p>

<h2 style="background:white"><span>Part
2. Personal Information Usage</span></h2>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.1
Discretion to Use Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RINGNROCK MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION FOR ANY
LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION. The following
paragraphs in Section 2 describe how RingNRock currently uses Personal
Information, but RingNRock may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted,
RingNRock may update this policy from time to time. &nbsp;RingNRock on its own
behalf or by using one of its service providers may use Personal Information to
provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising,
telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, and package stuffers, among other
possible uses. If we perform any of these functions, we will give you the
option to opt out of receiving this information. </span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.2
Solicited Email and SMS Messages.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock only sends SMS messages and
customer service emails to individuals who have agreed on the Website to
receive SMS messages and email from RingNRock during service initiation and
activation and as a part of the Services. RingNRock does not send unsolicited SMS
or email messages. &nbsp;As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for
unsolicited email are not applicable to RingNRock's email messages.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.3
Targeted Advertising.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock on its own behalf or by using one
of its service providers may use Personal Information to target advertising to
an individual. &nbsp;When an individual is using the Internet, RingNRock uses
Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual
with that person's Personal Information, and RingNRock attempts to show
advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an
interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology
Information, and otherwise. RingNRock may, at its discretion, target
advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other
means of communication to provide promotional offers.&nbsp; You can opt out of
receiving this advertising by emailing us at the email below. </span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.4
Mobile Phone SMS Messaging.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>In certain cases, when requested by an
individual, RingNRock or a Third Party may use Personal Information to provide
customized content and advertising via SMS messaging to an individual's cell
phone. RingNRock is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
such Third Parties.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.5
Use of Technology Information.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock uses Technology Information (1) to
match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other
categories of Personal Information to make and improve profiles of individuals,
(2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, and (3) to
determine which areas of RingNRock's websites are most frequently visited. This
information helps RingNRock to better understand the online habits of
individuals so that RingNRock can target advertising and promotions to them. </span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.6
Profiles of Individuals.</span></h4>

<p style="text-align:justify;background:white"><span>RingNRock supplements Personal Information to
make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey
Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Personal
Information such as information obtained from public databases.</span></p>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>2.7
Storage of Personal Information.</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span>RingNRock stores the Personal Information in
a database on RingNRock computers. Our computers have security measures (such
as a firewall and access control list) in place to protect against the loss,
misuse, and alteration of the information under RingNRock's control.
Notwithstanding such measures, RingNRock cannot guarantee that its security
measures will prevent RingNRock computers from being illegally accessed, and
the Personal Information on them stolen or altered.<span style="layout-grid-mode:
line"> No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
storage, is 100% secure.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal
information, we do not and cannot guarantee its security. </span></span></p>

<p style="background:white"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 style="background:white"><span>Part
3. Personal Information Dissemination</span></h2>

<h4 style="background:white"><span>3.1
Third Parties.</span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span>RingNRock operates sites on behalf of some of
its customers (for example, other businesses that contract with us to operate
mobile storefronts or other services for them). When we operate sites on behalf
of such customers, we may disclose your information (including personally
identifiable information) to them when you provide it to us as part of
registering for those sites or "opting in" for promotions, programs
or offerings from those customers. Our customers will use and disclose the
information we provide them pursuant to their own policies regarding such
information. RingNRock also maintains channels and other features on
RingNRock's own site(s) in cooperation with third parties (e.g., to feature the
work of certain musicians or other artists, or record labels/publishers), and
we may disclose your email address, telephone number or mobile identification
