This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you. <br><br>Any additional data that you provide, e.g. in a web-form, may also be logged. This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you. <br><br>Any additional data that your web-browser automatically provides may also be logged. This will be the case, for example, if your browser has previously been requested to store data on your computer in 'cookies' and submits them each time you request a web-page within a particular domain (such as Ringaling.tv). This data may or may not be sufficient to identify you.<br><br>If you disclose personal data to Ringaling.tv in conjunction with an identifier such as your name or your mobile/cellular telephone number, Ringaling.tv will collect this data. Moreover, any data that becomes available to Ringaling.tv through any of the means described in the preceding paragraphs may be able to be associated with that identifier. <br><br>Where Ringaling.tv collects data from sources other than you, it undertakes:<br><ul><li>to do so only by legal means;</li><li>to do so only with your Consent; and</li><li>to decare to you what sources it uses, and under what circumstances.<br></li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Data Security</span><br><br>Ringaling.tv undertakes to store personally identifiable information (PII) in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity. <br><br>Ringaling.tv undertakes to store personally identifiable information only in jurisdictions where data protections are at least equivalent to those required under the OECD Guidelines.<br><br>Ringaling.tv undertakes to transmit personally identifiable information in a manner that ensures security against unauthorised access, alteration or deletion, at a level commensurate with its sensitivity. <br><br>Ringaling.tv undertakes to implement appropriate measures to ensure security of personally identifiable information against inappropriate behaviour by Ringaling.tv's staff-members and contractors.

In these circumstances, Ringaling.tv will take any reasonable steps available to it to communicate to You that the use has occurred, unless it is precluded from doing so by law; and</li><li>such additional purposes as are authorised by law (in particular to protect Ringaling.tv's interests, e.g. if it believes on reasonable grounds that You have failed to fulfil your undertakings to Ringaling.tv or have committed a breach of the criminal law).</li></ul>Ringaling.tv undertakes to use personally identifiable information only if it has demonstrable relevance to the particular use to which it is being put. <br><br>Ringaling.tv undertakes to use personally identifiable information in such a manner as to take into account the possibility that it is not of sufficient quality for the purpose, e.g. because it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or out-of-context.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Disclosure</span><br><br>Disclosure refers to making personally identifiable information available to any party other than Ringaling.tv and You.
