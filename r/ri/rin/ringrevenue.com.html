     <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	 
     <div class="pageCopy">
         <p><strong>What is covered by this Policy?<br>
         </strong>Ring Revenue ("Ring Revenue" "we" or "us")
             provides pay-per-call services, using unique phone numbers and other
             forms of call tracking used in both online and offline advertising.&nbsp; Using
             unique phone numbers with personalization components, database management,
             and our proprietary and confidential systems we provide networks,
             advertisers, agencies, publishers (directly and indirectly, our “clients”),
             and consumers with pay-per-call features and services that are unmatched
            in our industry.</p>
         <p>We recognize that privacy is important, and our collection and use
             of information is limited to what is necessary to create innovative
             and reliable services for our clients, without compromising the
             individual privacy of consumers.</p>
         <p><strong><u>CONSUMER PRIVACY</u></strong></p>
         <p><strong>What information does Ring Revenue collect about consumers?</strong></p>
         <p><strong>General<u><br>
         </u></strong>When a consumer uses our services,
             for example, by calling a unique phone number associated with one
             of our advertiser clients, we will collect their personal information
             if it is made available to us by the consumer or by a third party.&nbsp; This information includes
             limited personal data such as the caller’s name, address,
             phone number and email address.&nbsp; We will not knowingly collect
            personal information from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
         <p><strong>User-supplied Information<u><br>
         </u></strong>We and our clients,
             for example, an advertiser, may set up order forms, questionnaires,
             or other mechanisms through which a consumer may be asked to provide
             certain information either online or via telephone or other communications
             medium.&nbsp; Participation is
             purely voluntary, and any consumer not wanting to participate may
             decline or terminate contact (e.g., navigate away from the web page
            or hang up the phone).&nbsp; </p>
         <p>If these mechanisms are included in our services prior to the time
             a consumer is connected with our client, any information collected
             by Ring Revenue will be subject to this policy.&nbsp; </p>
         <p>If such mechanisms are instead initiated by one of our clients outside
             of our services and our clients collect the information themselves,
             we cannot be responsible for that information, although we will
             endeavor to ensure that such clients maintain reasonable and appropriate
             privacy policies.</p>
         <p>In addition, we may receive from clients email addresses and telephone
             numbers of consumers for various purposes, for example, facilitating
             an outbound marketing campaign.&nbsp; Prior to obtaining any such
             information, we will require assurances from our clients that such
             information was obtained rightfully, and we must rely on those assurances
             in delivering our services.</p>
         <p><strong><u>Usage Information</u></strong></p>
         <p><u>Web services<br>
         </u>When a consumer responds to or views an internet
             advertisement served by a Ring Revenue client (such as through third-party
             web sites or email solicitation) or visits a Ring Revenue site,
             we may send one or more cookies (an anonymous, unique identifier)
             to the consumer’s
             computer to uniquely identify that consumer’s browser.&nbsp; Like
             most companies doing business on the internet, we use cookies to
             improve the quality of our services by storing user preferences,
             tracking user trends, determining how our services are used and
             navigated.&nbsp; Most cookies are automatically deleted at the end
             of a session at the Web Site.&nbsp; While we may use what are commonly
             described as “persistent” cookies that remain on a specific
             browser after termination of a session, any consumer may set their
             browser to refuse cookies or automatically clear cookies after termination
            of a session.</p>
         <p><u>Phone services<br>
         </u>We provide our clients unique telephone numbers
             to utilize on a web site, email or offline promotion.&nbsp; This enables us to both
             determine what the consumer was looking at when making a telephone
             call and personalize the experience for that consumer.&nbsp; Our
             phone servers automatically collect usage information when a consumer
             calls the number, including caller ID results, name of caller, and
            address of the caller when available.</p>
         <p>In addition, our phone servers use software that may be employed
             on behalf of an advertiser to record calls.&nbsp; This recorded
             information may be evaluated at the advertisers request in order
             to determine the quality of that call from the advertiser’s
             perspective.&nbsp; This enables us to identify high-quality calls,
             and collect additional usage data we can use to provide our clients
             with improved services and sales.&nbsp; The entire process is automated
             and involves no humans, although calls may be listened to for quality
             control and other purposes.&nbsp; In the event we record a call
             on behalf of an advertiser, we will ensure that call participants
             are advised of the existence and intent of the recording in a manner
             consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
         <p>Except under express written request by a client which shall be subject
             to approval by Ring Revenue, we do not expose our clients to any
             personally identifiable information derived from telephone calls,
             including, but not limited to, caller ID results, name of caller,
             address of the caller, and any recorded call data.&nbsp; While we
             strongly encourage clients to adopt responsible approaches to marketing,
             we are not responsible for the information practices of clients
             or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information
             by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy
             policies, which may differ from Ring Revenue’s policy.</p>
         <p><u>Reasons for collecting usage information<br>
         </u>We may collect usage
             information when an internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead,
             initiates a phone call, receives a phone call, makes a purchase
             on an advertiser's web site, sends us a text message, receives a
             text message from us, or makes an inquiry or a purchase during a
             phone call to an advertiser.&nbsp; We collect
             this information primarily for the purpose of paying third-parties
             commissions and also to optimize and personalize the internet and
             phone user's experience. If the internet user re-visits the advertiser's
             site directly, or if the phone user calls the advertiser using the
             unique phone number again, Ring Revenue is able to continue to track
             the user's activities on the advertiser's site and compensate the
             third party that referred the user. We reserve the right to retain
             all data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and
            audit purposes.</p>
         <p>Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect
             Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service
             provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time
             stamp. We may use the information to analyze site usage, administer
             the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and
             determine the relevance of content.</p>
         <p>We also may develop predictive statistical user profiles of consumers’ needs
             and interests by collecting both internet browsing and online purchase
             data and phone user data. &nbsp;For improved audience targeting,
             some Ring Revenue services may use marketing technology to allow
             advertisers to add non-personally-identifying demographic information,
             such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable
             profile data.</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue may collect personal information, such as consumers’ names,
             physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other information
             in order to better target campaigns to meet user's interests and
             to provide customized experiences, but will not share this information
             with third parties. &nbsp;For these purposes, we will not collect
             through any means credit card data or social security numbers.</p>
         <p><strong>Does Ring Revenue share consumers’ personal information
                 with others?<br>
         </strong>We do not share consumers’ personal information we have gathered
             with our clients.&nbsp; Our clients, however, may gather personal
             information by other means, especially if a consumer completes a
             transaction with them.</p>
         <p>We only share consumers’ personal information with companies
             or individuals outside of Ring Revenue in the following limited
             circumstances:</p>
         <ul type="disc">
             <li>We have the consumer’s consent.&nbsp;      We require
                 opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
         </ul>
         <ul type="disc">
             <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
                 companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose
                 of processing personal information on our behalf.&nbsp; We will
                 require these parties to agree to process such information based
                 on our instructions and in compliance with this privacy policy
                 and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.&nbsp; </li>
         </ul>
         <ul type="disc">
             <li>We may share personal information with our affiliates and other
                 third parties to provide consumers with goods or services requested
                 by them.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue may also share personal information in connection with
             the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of
             substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of Ring Revenue.</p>
         <p>Finally, Ring Revenue may release personal information when we believe
             release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply
             with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other
             agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ring Revenue
             or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
             and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
         <p><strong>Can a consumer “opt-out” of providing information?<br>
         </strong>For
             consumers accessing our services through the internet, some of our
             cookies have an "opt-out" option. This process does
             not remove the Ring Revenue cookie from a consumer’s system;
             it simply replaces it with an opt-out cookie that does not contain
             any unique identifiers. If this site provides such a process it
            is detailed below.</p>
         <p>Some of our cookies do not have an "opt-out" option, but
             consumers always have the option of blocking the use of cookies
             by changing a setting in their Internet browser.</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue does not maintain a process for an individual consumer
             to opt-out of a Ring Revenue ad serving cookie.&nbsp; However, any
             consumer may set their browser to refuse cookies or automatically
             clear cookies after termination of a session.</p>
         <p>With regard to phone services, consumers are able to submit their
             phone numbers to “do-not-call” registries.&nbsp; We
             will use our best efforts to observe do-not-call registries in any
             outbound calling campaign we perform or facilitate, provided that
             consumers who have opted-in to receive such messages, either with
             a client or with us, shall not be subject to any do-not-call restriction.</p>
         <p><strong>Can a consumer access the personal information acquired by
                 Ring Revenue?<br>
         </strong>Ring Revenue’s services are not
                 directed towards individual consumers, therefore we do not maintain
                 a process for an individual consumer to review and/or request
                 changes to any personal information collected.</p>
         <p>Except as provided below, we do not maintain a process for an individual
             consumer to access his or her personal information.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><strong><u>CLIENT PRIVACY</u></strong></p>
         <p><strong>What information does Ring Revenue collect from its clients
                 (e.g., networks, agencies, advertisers and publishers)?<br>
         </strong>We collect personal information from all of our clients (e.g., networks,
             agencies, advertisers, and publishers. The collection of this information
             is a part of our normal business practices. Advertisers or their
             representatives will be asked to provide personal information through
             the sign up and registration process either directly or through
             a network or agency partner, including name, address, phone number,
             hours of operation, coverage areas, email address, and social security
             number, tax ID number, etc. </p>
         <p>In addition, we will use cookies, log files and unique phone numbers
             to optimize and personalize the clients' experience and allow us
             to monitor those services and usage patterns.</p>
         <p><strong>How does Ring Revenue use its clients’ information?<br>
         </strong>Much of the information collected from clients is principally intended
             for administrative needs (e.g. accounting and performance reporting),
            for which purpose such data are required.</p>
         <p>While we strongly encourage clients to adopt responsible approaches
             to online marketing, we are not responsible for the information
             practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and
             disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to
             their respective privacy policies, which may differ from Ring Revenue’s
             policy.</p>
         <p>Periodically we may use clients’ information to communicate
             via email newsletters or other avenues to offer strategic marketing
             information and other communications to assist in business related
             activities. Our clients can elect to opt-out from future communications.</p>
         <p>Except as otherwise agreed, we will keep all personal data provided
             by individual clients in strict confidence and will treat such data
             with the same level of respect and care that we treat our own proprietary
             information and trade secrets. We will never sell, rent, exchange
             or barter any personal client information to or with any third party
             for financial gain or marketing purposes. We may, from time to time,
             provide such information to certain third-party administrative vendors
             for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program management
             services. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the
             confidentiality of information provided by Ring Revenue.</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue may also share information in connection with the sale,
             merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial
             asset, reorganization or liquidation of Ring Revenue.</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue may release information when we believe release is appropriate
             to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce
             or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect
             the rights, property, or safety of Ring Revenue or others. This
             includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
             for fraud protection.</p>
         <p><strong>Can a client “opt-out” of providing information?<br>
         </strong>Collecting
             information from our clients is required as a part of doing business.
             Ring Revenue’s primary intent in collecting
             information is for administrative purposes including accounting
             and reporting. However, we may periodically use information for
             marketing and communication purposes targeted to our clients. &nbsp;Clients
             wishing not to receive such communications may do so by informing
            their designated Ring Revenue representative in writing at any time.</p>
         <p>When a client logs on to any browser-based Ring Revenue reporting
             system, a cookie is placed within their computer. The cookie allows
             us to validate the client’s identity and maintain the security
             and privacy of the client's account data. This cookie is required
             to log into Ring Revenue’s reporting systems and there is
             no method to opt-out of this cookie.</p>
         <p><strong><u>GENERAL</u></strong></p>
         <p><strong>How does Ring Revenue protect the security of personal information?<br>
         </strong>Ring
             Revenue takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
             access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction
             of data. &nbsp;Any data stored on our servers is treated
             as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public.
             We restrict access to personal information to those employees or
             third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose
             of effectively delivering Ring Revenue products and services by
             means of user login and password requirements. We routinely evaluate
             our data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities
            for improvement.</p>
         <p>No transmission of data over the Internet or even the phones is guaranteed
             to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not
             under the control of Ring Revenue to intercept or access transmissions
             or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect
             your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
             of any information you transmit to us.</p>
         <p><strong>How are changes made to the Privacy Policy?<br>
         </strong>We may
             find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy
             Policy from time to time. &nbsp;When we do, we will post those changes
             on this page and update the effective date so that everyone is aware
             of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances
             we disclose it. &nbsp;Except as otherwise required by law, modifications
             to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected
            by Ring Revenue prior to the effective date of the policy change.</p>
         <p><strong>What are Ring Revenue’s policies regarding children
                 and SPAM?<br>
         </strong>Our services are not developed for or directed at children. Children
             (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to do business with
             us, and we do not collect personal information from any person we
             actually know is under the age of 13. If you believe your child
             has provided Ring Revenue with any personally identifiable data,
             please contact us at legal@ringrevenue.com to have them removed.</p>
         <p>Ring Revenue is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance
             with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our
             policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam" e-mail
             by Ring Revenue or any of its marketing partners.</p>
         <p>Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required
             to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from
             future emails about the advertiser.</p>
         <p><strong>European Union Safe Harbor.<br>
         </strong>The European Union ("EU")
             maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly
             from US laws. To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU
             have created a Safe Harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy
             operations. Ring Revenue, Inc. adheres to the Safe Harbor principals.
