<em>RinkWorks</em> respects the privacy and confidentially of its associates
and readers.  Below is our policy regarding the privacy of Internet users.
</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li><p><span class="itemstart"><em>RinkWorks</em> does not acquire or collect any
personal information about you for any reasons other than internal use, except
where explicitly indicated.</span>
Any and all personal information collected for internal use will
be treated confidentially; it will not be given out, nor will it be used for
any purpose other than the operation of the <cite>RinkWorks</cite> site.  (For
example, some of our online features require registration to participate.  If
there is a technical problem, or a question we have concerning your use of
the feature, we will use your email address, as submitted to us upon
registration, to contact you about these matters.  Your email address will
not, however, be sold or given out to anyone.)  <cite>RinkWorks</cite> does,
however, accrue anonymous information which is specific to its readers'
browsing habits on <cite>RinkWorks</cite>.  This information is anonymous; it
does not contain personal details, although it does contain non-personally
identifying details, including, but not limited to, your IP address and the
browser you are using.  This information is obtained solely for the purpose of
tracking traffic flow patterns through the <cite>RinkWorks</cite> site and
measuring levels of interest and accessibility in different areas of
<cite>RinkWorks</cite>.</p>
<ul class="spaced">
<li><p>An addendum to the above, <cite>RinkWorks</cite> does, in some explicitly
documented instances, collect voluntarily-supplied personal information,
including but not limited to the <cite><a href="/demographic/">Demographic
Survey</a></cite>, which is used to collect information about the types of
visitors <cite>RinkWorks</cite> receives, is voluntary, and is always anonymous.
In this and all other cases where <cite>RinkWorks</cite> asks for personal
information, it will be kept strictly confidential and used only for the
purposes expressed when it is asked for.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><span class="itemstart"><cite>RinkWorks</cite> uses third-party
advertising companies to serve ads</span> when you visit our web site.  These
companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address,
email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web
sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest
to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know
your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.
</p>

<p>These companies may also temporarily store some code within
your browser that allows the advertising agencies we work with to respond
properly to the ads that are delivered.  These codes are commonly known as
"cookies."  The cookies served in conjunction with the advertising are not
the doing, nor the responsibility of <cite>RinkWorks</cite>.</p>

<p>For more information please see the following details associated with a
subset of the advertising agencies we work with:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
<li><p>
<em>From BURST! Media's privacy policy:</em>
"When you are first served a BURST! ad, BURST! may temporarily store some codes 
within your browser that allows us to respond properly to the ads that we
deliver. These codes are commonly known as "cookies." For example, these codes
let us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. It also
helps us determine where to send you when you click on an ad. Unlike many
other ad networks, we do not use cookies for the purpose of setting unique
identifiers that are used to identify you whenever you return to a web site
within the BURST! network.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire."
</p></li>

<li><p>
<em>Concerning ValueClick/Fastclick:</em>
"We have contracted with ValueClick to monitor certain pages of our web site
for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement
'click-throughs,' and/or other activities on our web site. Where authorized by
us, ValueClick may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring
technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.
No personally identifiable information is collected by or transferred to any
party other than the Advertiser. For more information about how the information
