</p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
</center>
<p></p><hr><p>

<em>RinkWorks</em> respects the privacy and confidentially of its associates
and readers.  Below is our policy regarding the privacy of Internet users.</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li> <em>RinkWorks</em> does not acquire or collect any personal information
about you for any reasons other than internal use, except where explicitly
indicated.  Any and all personal information collected for internal use will
be treated confidentially; it will not be given out, nor will it be used for
any purpose other than the operation of the <em>RinkWorks</em> site.  (For
example, some of our online features require registration to participate.  If
there is a technical problem, or a question we have concerning your use of
the feature, we will use your email address, as submitted to us upon
registration, to contact you about these matters.  Your email address will
not, however, be sold or given out to anyone.)  <em>RinkWorks</em> does,
however, accrue anonymous information which is specific to its readers'
browsing habits on <em>RinkWorks</em>.  This information is anonymous; it does
not contain personal details, although it does contain non-personally
identifying details, including, but not limited to, your IP address and the
browser you are using.  This information is obtained solely for the purpose of
tracking traffic flow patterns through the <em>RinkWorks</em> site and
measuring levels of interest and accessibility in different areas of
<em>RinkWorks</em>.<p>

</p></li><li> An addendum to the above, <em>RinkWorks</em> does, in some explicitly
documented instances, collect voluntarily-supplied personal information,
including, but not limited to, the <a href="/survey/"><em>Reader
Survey</em></a> -- which is used to collect information about what you like and
don't like about <em>RinkWorks</em>, is purely voluntary, and can be anonymous
if you choose not to answer the questions about your name and email address --
and the <a href="/demographic/"><em>Demographic Survey</em></a>, which is used
to collect information about the types of visitors <em>RinkWorks</em>
receives, is also voluntary, and is always anonymous.  In these and all other
cases where <em>RinkWorks</em> asks for personal information, it will be kept
strictly confidential and used only for the express purposes for which it
is asked.<p>

</p></li><li> The advertising banners used on most <em>RinkWorks</em> pages may
temporarily store some code within your browser that allows BURST!, our
advertising agency, to respond properly to the ads that are delivered.
These codes are commonly known as "cookies."  The cookies served in conjunction
with the ad banners is not the doing, nor the responsibility of
<em>RinkWorks</em>.  Here is a quotation of the relevant part of BURST!'s
privacy policy:<p>

</p><blockquote><font size="-1">
When you are first served a BURST! ad, BURST! may temporarily store some codes 
within your browser that allows us to respond properly to the ads that we
deliver. These codes are commonly known as "cookies." For example, these codes
let us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. It also
helps us determine where to send you when you click on an ad. Unlike many
other ad networks, we do not use cookies for the purpose of setting unique
identifiers that are used to identify you whenever you return to a web site
within the BURST! network.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 
</font></blockquote><p>

</p></li><li> This web site contains links to other sites. 
This statement is for the sole use and purpose of <em>RinkWorks</em>.
Please be aware that <em>RinkWorks</em> is not responsible for the privacy 
practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy 
practices of each and every web site that collects your personal
information.<p>

</p></li><li> This site makes public forums available to you, including, but not
limited to, the <a href="/rinkforum/"><em>Message Forum</em></a>
and <a href="/rinkchat/"><em>RinkChat</em></a>.  Please be aware,
whenever you post personal information online, through the <em>Message
Forum</em>, <em>RinkChat</em>, or other public online area, that this
information can be collected and used by others.  <em>RinkWorks</em>
assumes any and all information posted to these public areas as intended
for public disclosure.<p>

</p></li><li> <em>RinkWorks</em> takes reasonable security measures to protect the
loss, inappropriate disclosure, and misuse of the information under our
control.  However, should a breach in security occur and information stolen
or altered by anyone, <em>RinkWorks</em> cannot be held responsible for this
loss or theft.<p>
