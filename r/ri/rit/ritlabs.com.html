<h3>II. How does Ritlabs use this information?</h3>
<p>Ritlabs uses your personal information to provide you with service and support, to determine whether you are eligible for support, to resend you registration keys, to tailor the Website and its content to your preferences, to mitigate attacks to the website, to prevent hacking of the website, and to aid Ritlabs in changing the content of the Website or improve the Website usability.</p>
<h3>III. How does Ritlabs secure this information?</h3>

<h3>IV. Does Ritlabs share this information with third parties?</h3>
<p>On some pages of the Website, Ritlabs uses the Facebook Pixel, so, when you access a page of the Website that has a Facebook pixel, your browser software also accesses Facebook, so Facebook is aware that you have visited certain Website page at certain time from certain IP address using certain browser software, operating system, screen resolution, and so on. However, in no case Ritlabs share with the Facebook any information that Ritlabs have collected from you directly or that you have filled in the registration form at the Website. The Facebook Pixel is used by Ritlabs to better suite Facebook advertisement to you.</p>
<p>Ritlabs does not sell or rent or share your personal or personally identifiable information to third parties. Whenever Ritlabs wished to do analytics of its customers or visitors, it depersonalizes all the information collected from You before transferring it to third parties.</p>
<p>Ritlabs may transfer your personal information to share information with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, or distributors or to a third party in a sale of the Website, a sale of Ritlabs, or a sale of substantially all of the assets of Ritlabs, notifying you about this. Ritlabs may also transfer your personal information to respond to a duly authorized subpoena or court order, to respond to regulatory requests by government authorities, to protect the safety or security of Ritlabs, the Website, its employees, and its users, and, where necessary, to protect against fraud, false advertising, or the violation of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or treaty whether local, state, provincial, national, or international.</p><p>

<h3>IV. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>You may use a pseudonym, a nickname, or a fictional name (providing it does not infringe others’ rights and is inoffensive) instead of your real name, but you may not leave blank (unfilled) the appropriate fields.</p>
<p>You may obtain without charge, a list of categories of your personal information that Ritlabs has collected, has used, or has disclosed to third parties. You may also obtain without charge a copy of your personal information that we have.</p>

<p>You may also ask us to amend, rectify, or delete your personal information that is kept for more than 30 days. However, if you ask us to delete your personal information that is kept for up to 30 days, we will take no action since this information will be deleted anyway automatically upon the expiration of the retention period specified in this privacy policy, and because it may not always be possible to delete this temporary information, since it is mostly kept in the Website log files in plain text format, not in a database that would have allowed an easy deletion or rectification or amendment.</p>

However, after the deletion of your user account, your forum posts or in your technical support tickets will show as created by the deleted user.

However, if you have provided sensitive personal information in the text of the technical support tickets, you can ask Ritlabs to depersonalize it.
