<h3>What Do We Collect and Why?</h3>
<p>You may browse our site without providing us any information that is identifiable for you.</p>
<h3>IP Address</h3>
<p>We use your IP address and other standard log file information to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.

<p>Our site uses cookies for a number of reasons, such as (a) to keep track of your shopping cart, (b) to recognize you when you return to our site and (c) to recognize whether a customer came to our site as a result of a promotion on one of our partners’ sites. Some of these cookies may be placed by our third party service providers to recognize when a user visits this site. The information collected and shared through this technology is non-personally identifiable. We also collect anonymous visitor information about how you utilize our site, such as IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet Explorer or Netscape), referring pages and pages visited. We use this information (a) to perform anonymous statistical analysis of Web page traffic patterns, (b) to administer our Web site and servers, and (c) to improve our services.</p>

We use this contact information from the order form to send you a confirmation e-mail for which you cannot opt out. We also use this information to send you your orders, as well as information about our company and products and special promotions. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary for additional information to process or fulfill your order. Financial information that is collected is used to bill for products and services.
