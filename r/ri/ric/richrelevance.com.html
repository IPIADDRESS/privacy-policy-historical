    <h1>richrelevance Privacy Policy</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information within and by the richrelevance corporate website and account dashboard ("Website") and richrelevance products and services ("RPS"). "Personal Information" means individually identifiable information that would allow a party to identify you or to contact you (online or offline). This type of information may include, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
    <p>The Website provides marketing information and signup and account management functionality for RPS. The information and registration areas of the richrelevance Website are intended for current and prospective users of RPS. RPS is a suite of hosted recommendations and personalization services that let retail and similar websites provide their users with personalized recommendations and more.</p>
    <br>
    <span class="style6"> Website </span>
    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>The Website requires a minimal amount of Personal Information to maintain account information and communicate with commerce sites who have registered with richrelevance ("Customers") regarding use of RPS. Additional information may be needed in the future by us or by partners in order to provide Customers with additional products and services. If additional information is needed, we will amend this policy and post the changes on the Website. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you via email when changes have been made to this policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Email Address</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance uses the email provided by Customers only as a means for us to communicate with each Customer concerning issues related to the use of RPS. This email address is not visible to others within the system.  richrelevance will not rent, sell, or disclose your email address to third parties.  richrelevance may send Customers certain communications relating to their use of RPS or changes to features of RPS, or this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance cookies Customers in order to save state information and make it easier to access account information.  This data is used only in conjunction with your use of the service and is not used separately or shared with any third party. Accessing the Website is not dependent on accepting cookies and all major browsers allow you to disable cookies should you desire to do so.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance may disclose Customer account and contact names internally and to advisors, investors, and others with an interest in the use of RPS. We limit access to specific contact information internally to only those employees and contractors who design and maintain the system information stores or who have a reasonable need to come in contact with and make use of such information for account purposes.</p>
    <br>
    <span class="style5">RPS </span>
    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance does not collect, store, or make use of any Personal Information of end users of RPS ("Consumers"). Whereas Customers may collect Personal Information from Consumers, richrelevance does not come in contact with, and specifically disclaims any association with, any such information.  Customers that use site authorization may use usernames as a key for richrelevance for its consumers. richrelevance has no control over the data contained within usernames and uses this information only as a database identifier.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>We assign cookies to Consumers in order to save preference information and make it possible to leverage RPS without having to register with richrelevance or with a Customer. This data is used only in conjunction with a Consumerâ€™s use of RPS and is not used separately by or shared with any third party. If cookies are disabled by the Consumer, richrelevance may be prevented from providing personalized recommendations.</p>
    <p><strong>IP Address</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance may record IP information of Consumers. Such information may be used for targeting, monitoring, auditing, and reporting use of RPS.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of Aggregated Information</strong></p>
    <p>We may disclose aggregated information about the use of RPS to business partners, prospective investors, and others. Additionally, we may produce industry-standard traffic reports for assessing use of RPS. We will use information only in the aggregate in order to monitor and improve RPS.</p>
    <br>
    <span class="style6">General Measures</span>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. However, no Internet site can fully eliminate security risks.</p>
    <p><strong>Children's Online Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>Children under 13 are not permitted to use the Website and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the Website. </p>
    <p><strong>Outside Parties/Successors</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance will only share Personal Information with outside parties in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our website. If richrelevance becomes part of another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by richrelevance and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. richrelevance will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the richrelevance site before information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information Collected Under Other Circumstances</strong></p>
    <p>richrelevance may collect and retain personal information from you under other circumstances, such as any communications regarding job postings, service improvements, or support issues. richrelevance will use the same measure of care with this information as we provide to our own private information and office communications.</p>
    <p><strong>Amendments</strong></p>
    <p>We may amend this policy at any time. Notices of amendments will be posted on our site. We may also send notice of changes via email to Customers who have registered on the Website.</p>
