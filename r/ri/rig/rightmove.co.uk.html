Finally, we may collect information about your property and the type of property you wish to purchase.</p>
<h2>Information collection and use</h2>
<p>Your information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services and features that you have requested.

<p>The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Sending emails</h3>
<p>The information that you complete on the 'contact agent' forms on this Site is recorded by us and is sent to the agent that you wish to contact.   This helps them provide you with a more personalised service.  We also send the agent details of your last search to help them find property that matches your requirements more closely.</p>
<h3>Email a Friend</h3>
<p>When you use the 'email a friend' feature of this Site we record which properties you have been sent to the friend solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service.

We do not make this individual information available to our member agents or third parties.</p>
<h3>Using the 'email updates'</h3>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/RegistrationAction?update=false">register</a> with us and use the '<a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/EmailUpdatesAction?eventsubmit_doviewsettings=1&amp;rl=true&amp;n_eml=upd_tab">your email updates</a>' feature to receive notification when new properties matching your criteria are added to this Site, we record the settings you use and which properties have been sent to you.
