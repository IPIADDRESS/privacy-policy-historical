Finally, we may collect information about your property and the type of property you wish to purchase.</p>
<h2>Information collection and use</h2>
<p>Your information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services and features that you have requested.   We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features.</p>

<p>The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Sending emails</h3>
<p>The information that you complete on the 'contact agent' forms on this Site is recorded by us and is sent to the agent that you wish to contact.   This helps them provide you with a more personalised service.  We also send the agent details of your last search to help them find property that matches your requirements more closely.</p>
<h3>Email a Friend</h3>
<p>When you use the 'email a friend' feature of this Site we record which properties you have been sent to the friend solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service.  We will NOT add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists to protect you and the recipient's privacy.</p>
<h3>Registering with us</h3>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/action/RegistrationAction?update=false">register</a> with us, we save the details you provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you.

We do not make this individual information available to our member agents or third parties.</p>
<h3>Using the 'email updates'</h3>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/action/RegistrationAction?update=false">register</a> with us and use the '<a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/action/EmailUpdatesAction?eventsubmit_doviewsettings=1&amp;rl=true&amp;n_eml=upd_tab">your email updates</a>' feature to receive notification when new properties matching your criteria are added to this Site, we record the settings you use and which properties have been sent to you.

<h2>Who has access to the information you provide or we collect</h2>
<p>We retain access to all personal information that we have collected from you.</p>
<p>When our service is available via the websites of our partners, those partners may have access to your information.  Their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any other websites, even if you access them using links from this Site or if you can access this Site or use our services from them.  We therefore recommend that you check the policy of each site that you visit and make sure that you are comfortable with the terms of such policies before providing any personal information.</p>

<p>If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.</p>
<p>We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission unless we are required to do so by law.</p>

<p>All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing '<a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/action/RegistrationAction?update=true">your details</a>' page.</p>
