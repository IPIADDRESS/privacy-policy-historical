	yourself, including your name and your contact details. We may also collect information about how you use this
	Site including your searches, the properties and pages you look at, the advertisers or partners you contact and the contents of
	the emails you send to them. Finally, we may also collect information from any correspondence that you have with
	us. Collectively, we refer to this as "Your Information".</p>

<p>All of the forms where you might enter personal information on our Site have tick box options to enable you to
	specify your consent (or otherwise) to our use of Your Information. We always use the the most recently submitted
	form to be your current consent  status. If you are a registered user, but not signed in when you submit a form,
	we won't be able to use your saved settings so will deem your consent choice to be as per the form you submit at the time.</p>

<h2>How we use Your Information</h2>

<p>Your Information will enable us to provide you with access to all parts of this Site and to supply the services
	and features that you have requested. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in
	our marketing and to help us develop, administer, support and improve our services and features.</p>

<p>We may use Your Information to contact you for your views on our services and to notify you
	occasionally about important changes or developments to this Site or our services. Where you have
	consented, we may also use Your Information to contact you with details about any other products or services
	we or our partners or advertisers offer that may be of interest to you. Where you have consented to being contacted
	by third parties, we may make Your Information available to them. If you change your mind about being contacted in
	the future, please <a href="/rightmoveplc/rightmove-contacts.html">contact us here</a> and tell us.
</p>

<p>The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Contacting Advertisers</h2>

<p>The information that you enter into any of the forms we offer to allow you to contact advertisers is recorded by us
	and then sent to the advertiser that you chose to contact. This helps them provide you with a more personalised service. We also
	send the advertiser details of your last search to help them find property that matches your requirements more
	closely. If you are a registered user and signed in when you contact an advertiser, we include your settings to help
	them to provide more personalised services to you</p>

<h2>Telephone calls</h2>

<p>When you contact our advertisers using an 0843 telephone number, information regarding the time and date of the call,
	status of the call (answered, unanswered, engaged) along with your telephone number (when presented) will be 
	available to that advertiser. If the advertiser you contact has opted into our telephone recording functionality,
	your phone calls will also be recorded for training and monitoring purposes. The recordings will only be available
	to the advertiser you contacted and Rightmove employees.</p>

<h2>Email a Friend</h2>


<p>When you use the email a friend feature of this Site we record which properties you have sent to the friend,
	solely so that we can track the popularity of those properties. We record the other details provided in the email for
	internal monitoring of the service. We will NOT add any information collected in this manner to our mailing lists or inform the advertiser, to
	protect you and the recipient's privacy.</p>

<h2>Registering with us</h2>

<p>If you <a href="/register.html">register</a> with us, we save the details you
	provide and use them to enable us to personalise the service we offer to you. You can update <a href="/user/details.html">your details</a> at any time via the site. When
	you are signed in, we automatically pre-populate your saved details on contact forms.</p>

<h2>Saving properties</h2>

<p>If you <a href="/register.html">register</a> with us and <a href="/user/shortlist/redirect.html">save properties</a> you are interested in, we
	can identify which properties you have saved. We may anonymously aggregate these details to indicate how many users have
	saved a particular property, but we will not make available to third parties any personal data relating to which users have
	saved which properties.</p>

<h2>Using the property alerts and saved searches</h2>

<p>If you <a href="/register.html">register</a> with us, save searches and/or use the <a href="/user/saved-searches/redirect.html">property alerts</a> feature to receive notification when new
	properties matching your criteria are added to this Site, we record the settings you use and which properties
	have been sent to you. We do not make any information about any property that has been sent to you available to
	our advertisers or third parties.</p>

<h3 class="subsequent">Who has access to the information you provide or we collect</h3>

<p>We retain access to all personal information that we have collected from you.</p>

<p>When our service is available via the websites of our partners, those partners may have access to Your Information.
	Their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy
	policies and practices of any other websites, even if you access them using links from this Site or if you can access
	this Site or use our services from them. We therefore recommend that you check the policy of each site that you visit
	and make sure that you are comfortable with the terms of such policies before providing any personal information.</p>

<p>If you have consented on your <a href="/user/details.html">my details</a>
	page, the appropriate email form, or in conversation with us, we may provide any of Your Information to carefully screened third
	parties to contact you regarding products or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you change
	your mind about being contacted by these third parties in the future, please
    <a href="/rightmoveplc/rightmove-contacts.html">contact us here</a>&gt; and tell us.</p>

<p>If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, Your
	Information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.</p>

<p>If we offer or supply a service to you that is provided on our behalf by a third party we may have to pass Your Information
	to them in order to deliver the service. By using this site you consent to us providing Your Information to the third
	parties licensed by us to provide such services. We may also use third parties to provide services on our behalf which
	may include processing (but not using themselves) Your Information e.g. to complete partial addresses or to augment
	the information we hold about you. In either case, we will not pass your data to anyone who is not also registered with
	the Data Protection Act or is not subject to these or similar provisions in our contract with them and we will not allow
	the third party to use Your Information commercially without your consent.</p>

<p>We will not otherwise disclose, sell or distribute Your Information to any third party without your permission
	unless we are required to do so by law.</p>

<h2>Access to, changing or removing the information we hold</h2>

<p>Registered users of this Site can update their information, change settings or cancel their membership on their
	<a href="/user/details.html">your details</a> page once signed in.</p>

<p>Non-registered and registered users of this Site can request we provide them with a copy of the personally
	identifiable information we hold via <a href="/rightmoveplc/rightmove-contacts.html">contact us</a>.
	You may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure that such information is accurate and kept up-to-date. We
	may charge a small administration fee to cover the data search, preparation and delivery.</p>

<h3 class="subsequent">Cookies and tracking</h3>

<p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enable us to personalise your visits to this website, simplify
	the signing-in procedure, keep track of your preferences and to track the usage of this website. Cookies are
	small pieces of information that are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. Your browser
	will have the option to prevent websites using cookies (your browser's help screen or manual will tell you
	how to do this), but please note that this may reduce the functionality of this Site and other websites.</p>

<p>Like all websites, our servers automatically record 'log files' containing information about the volume
	and characteristics of our website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on
	site. We use log files to build pictures of how our site is used that help us to monitor and improve the
	service. We cannot identify you from your log files.</p>

<h2>Security, storage and transfer of information</h2>

<p>We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or
	disclosed to a third party without your permission (unless they are providing services as outlined in the 'who
	has access to Your Information' section above) and to prevent unauthorised access to it. The computers that
	store the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls
	and other measures to restrict electronic access. If we are working with third parties we will require them to
	have in place similar measures to protect Your Information.</p>

<p>All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information
	to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you
	when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we
	disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your
	<a href="/user/details.html">my details</a> page.</p>

<p>Your Information will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.</p>

<p>We will retain Your Information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.</p>

<h3>Property Details Displayed on Rightmove</h3>

<p>Rightmove does not accept UK property listings directly from consumers. If you are the owner of a property being 
	displayed for sale or for rent on our website this is because the agent you have chosen to use for the sale or
	the letting of your property has a contract with us to display the details of your property on our website and
	thereby place the information about your property fully in the public domain. </p>

<p>Details held by us about a property do not comprise personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998.
	Rightmove may use the data which we hold about properties advertised to provide professional valuation services
	and other data services to third parties. If your property is listed for sale or rent on Rightmove you may ask us
	not to use some or all of the details of your property to provide such data services. In this event please write to
	the Data Controller, Rightmove Group Limited, 33 Soho Square, London W1D 3QU stating your full name and address,
	confirmation that you are the owner of the property upon whose instructions we are entitled to act, the full postal
	address of your property, the date it was placed on the market for sale or rent, and the name address and telephone
	number of the agent you have instructed to market the property.</p>


<h3 class="subsequent">Changes to the policy</h3>

<p>We may change this policy from time to time as we add new services or features or in response to changes in the
	law or our commercial arrangements. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this Site.</p></div>
