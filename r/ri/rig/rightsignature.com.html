    <p class="P8"><span class="T7">If you subscribe to use our Services, your
    Personally Identifiable Information will be shared with counterparties to
    the documents that you electronically sign using our Services. &nbsp;Upon
    execution of a document, all parties to a document</span> <span class="T3">("</span><span class="T5">Signing Parties</span><span class="T3">")</span> <span class="T7">receive a copy of the signed document, an
    appended signature certificate (a "</span><span class="T8">Signature

    document, Signature Certificate, and related metadata may contain the
    following information about the Signing Parties: names; email addresses; IP
    addresses; drawn signatures; and checksums, which may represent, but not
    reveal, biometric signature data, system preferences, browser preferences,
    installed plug-ins, local storage preferences, screen resolutions, local

    "</span><span class="T8">Checksum Metadata</span><span class="T7">"), as
    well as any Personally Identifiable Information included in the

    <p class="P8"><span class="T7">When a Signing Party has elected to
    integrate with a third-party service, such as ShareFile, Dropbox, or
    Salesforce, signed documents are disseminated to each such third-party
    service (each, an "</span><span class="T8">Integration Partner
    Service</span><span class="T7">") via an application programming interface.
    When documents are transmitted to an Integration Partner Service, the
    signed documents, Signature Certificates, and related metadata transmitted
    by or to the Integration Partner Service or stored by such Integration
    Partner Service may</span> <span class="T7">contain Checksum Metadata of
    the Signing Parties as well as any Personally Identifiable Information
    included in the document. In the event that signed documents are
    disseminated to an Integration Partner Service, the data, including the
    documents, Signature Certificates and Checksum Metadata, are subject to the
    security protocols and privacy policies of such Integration Partner
    Service.</span></p>

    <p class="P16"><span class="T6">Resale or Disclosure of Personally

    <p class="P9"><span class="T10">We do not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease
    any Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site, unless you
    request us to contact you. On occasion, we sell, rent, loan, trade or lease
    Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site.</span>
    <span class="T3">We also periodically mine anonymous statistical

    stored by third-party Integration Partner Services to which you or other
    Signing Parties who are counterparties to your documents have elected to
    transmit Personally Identifiable Information.</span> <span class="T10">&nbsp;We share Contact Data, Demographic Data, and Financial Data
    with our business partners who perform credit card transactions for us to

    <p class="P16"><span class="T6">Use of Personally Identifiable Information
    by Signing Parties</span></p>

    <p class="P9"><span class="T10">If you use the Services, we have no control
    over the data collection, storage, or transmission practices of the other
    Signing Parties to your documents. If your documents, Signature
    Certificates, or Checksum Metadata contain Personally Identifiable
    Information or other information that you would not want disclosed, you
    should ensure that the other Signing Parties</span> <span class="T7">who
    are counterparties to your documents</span> <span class="T10">have adopted
    reasonable administrative, physical, technical, and organizational
    safeguards.</span></p>

    <p class="P15"><span class="T6">Browser Information Collected on the

    <p class="P10"><span class="T3">We analyze our website logs to continually
    re-evaluate our Site's content to improve our Site and Services. These logs
    do not allow the identification of any Personally Identifiable Information.
    Our Site also records IP addresses of visitors. An IP address is a number
    that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.
    We use IP addresses to identify Signing Parties, analyze trends, track user
    movement, and gather broad statistics. The IP addresses of Signing Parties
    are disclosed on the signature certificates of documents.</span></p>

    <p class="P15"><span class="T11">Use of Cookies</span></p>

    <p class="P11"><span class="T3">A "cookie" is a small text file that is
