<h1>RightNow Technologies Inc.</h1>
<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>

<div class="footn">Last revised 
9/18/2003</div>

<p>RightNow Technologies, Inc. is committed to your right to privacy.
As a visitor to our website or user of our product, you deserve the
ability to control the uses of your personal information.  This
privacy statement discloses our privacy practices.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement is directed at visitors to our website.  We
have adopted a separate Statement called "Privacy when Hosting" to
address the privacy needs of our customers whose software we host (see
<a href="http://www.rightnow.com/privacy/hosting.php">http://www.rightnow.com/privacy/hosting.php</a>,
etc.).</p>

<p>RightNow agrees to notify you of the following:</p>

<ol class="short">
<li> What personally identifiable information of yours or third party
personal identification is collected from you through the website</li>
<li> The organization collecting the information</li>
<li> How the information is used</li>
<li> With whom the information may be shared</li>
<li> What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and
distribution of the information</li>
<li> The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the
loss, misuse or alteration of information under RightNow's
control</li>
<li> How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>If you feel that RightNow is not abiding by its posted privacy
policy, you should contact us by addressing your concerns to <a href="mailto:cpo@rightnow.com">cpo@rightnow.com</a>.</b></p>

<p>RightNow collects information from our users at several different
points on our website to enable us to better inform you about our
product. By knowing your preferences we can deliver relevant
information that meets your needs and ensure that your visit to our
site is quick, easy and productive.  RightNow is the sole owner of the
information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent
this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in
this statement.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Registration</h3>
<p>In order to use some functions on this website, a user must first
complete a registration form.  During registration, the user is
required to give their contact information (such as name and email
address).  This information is used to contact the user about the
services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  RightNow
does not share any personally identifiable or private customer
information submitted online with third parties.  Demographic
information may also be requested (such as zip code or type of
business).  This information may be stored, analyzed and used to
assist us to improve our services.</p>
 
<h3 class="sec">Cookies</h3>
<p>RNT uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.  A
cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web
server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be
read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
you. Cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users
to simplify and enhance the experience on our site (i.e. prefilling
forms similar to those you may have already completed).  Once the user
closes their browser, the cookie information is no longer available
through our server.  You can set your browser to notify you when you
receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to
accept it.  If a user rejects the cookie, they can still use our
site.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Log Files</h3>
<p>We use IP addresses in log files to analyze trends, administer the
site, track a user's movements, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.  Log files do not enable us to access
personally identifying information, such as email addresses.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Links</h3>
<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that
RightNow is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site
and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that
collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement
applies solely to information collected at this website.</p>

<h3 class="sec">RightNow eService Center Support Site</h3>
<p>Currently, RightNow eService Center support is available in its
entirety to RightNow customers whose eService Center license agreement
is current.  If you are a current RightNow eService Center customer,
you may receive web support by visiting our support site and logging
in. This allows you to to view our published Answers and ask questions
of our support personnel.  Your questions and our answers may be
published on our website, and made available to other website
visitors.  However, those visitors will have no way of knowing that
one or more of the questions on the website was asked by you.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Webcasts</h3>
<p>RightNow offers its users an opportunity to participate in live
Webcasts which are hosted by PlaceWare, Inc.  A participant must
register through a link to take part in the Webcast.  The information
collected at the time of registration (such as name, address, e-mail
address) enables us to contact the participant with password and login
information for the Webcast. Additionally, registrants may be
contacted by phone to ensure that they have the needed information for
attending the Webcast.  The participant is given an opportunity to
opt-in to receive future e-mails about eService education, products
and events either by phone or via on-line surveys. A user may opt-out
of being contacted in the future by emailing <a href="mailto:info@rightnow.com">info@rightnow.com</a> with their
request to delete them from the "Webcast email list."  Please refer to
placeware.com for more information regarding their privacy
statement.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Newsletter</h3>
<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our <i>eService OnTarget</i>
newsletter, they must opt in.  At that point we ask for contact
information such as name and email address. Users who no longer wish
to receive our newsletter can unsubscribe when they receive it by
clicking on a link at the bottom of the newsletter. The user will then
be given an opportunity to opt in or out of future newsletters and opt
in or out of further periodic RightNow communications.</p>

<p>Email forwarding functionality is provided in the newsletter. Using
this functionality will forward the newsletter privately.  However, if
you use other forwarding methods, like those provided in your email
client, they may transfer personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Public Forums</h3>
<p>This site makes chat rooms forums, message boards, and/or news groups
available to users.  Please remember that any information that is
disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should
exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
information.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Surveys</h3>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via
surveys.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and
the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
information.  Information requested may include contact information
(such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip
code, age level).  Survey information will be used for purposes of
monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Children</h3>
<p>RightNow products are for use by businesses.  Therefore, we would not
expect children under the age of 18 to provide us with any personally
identifiable information.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Hot Connections Referral Program</h3>
<p>If a customer joins our Inner Circle Program and decides to refer a
prospect as a part of that program, we ask them to provide the
prospect's name, company, title, phone, address (if available), as
well as information about their relationship with the prospect.  The
Inner Circle member can request a call from the sales representative
prior to the prospect being contacted.  The referral prospect may
contact RightNow at <a href="mailto:info@rightnow.com">info@rightnow.com</a> to request the
removal of this information from the RightNow database.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Security</h3>
<p>RightNow takes precautions to protect our customers' information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your
information is protected both online and off-line using standard
security best practices such as firewalls, encryption and intrusion
detection.  Full backups are performed every week on the entire file
system and incremental backups are done daily. Finally, all hosted
servers are kept physically secure in world-class hosting data
centers.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Credit Cards</h3>
<p>We do not currently accept credit card information on-line. If and
when credit card information is requested in the future, this policy
will be updated.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Special Offers</h3>
<p>We send all new Inner Circle members a welcoming email to verify
password and username.  We send the <i>e-Service OnTarget</i>
newsletter to those people who specifically request it.  Visitors to
our website will occasionally receive information on products,
services and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our
users, we present the option to not receive these types of
communications. Please see "Opting Out" below</p>

<h3 class="sec">Updating Personal Information and Opting Out:</h3>
<p>We encourage our users to update our record of any personal
information which changes (such as your zip code). Information can be
corrected/updated on any registration form. Users can also opt out of
our services by emailing a request to <a href="info@rightnow.com">info@rightnow.com</a>.  Inner Circle
information may be updated online at <a href="http://www.rightnow.com/customers/inner.html">http://www.rightnow.com/customers/inner.html</a>.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>RightNow will update this policy from time to time.  A "last revised"
date will always be included on the bottom of the statement.  To keep
up-to-date with RightNow's' policy, please check this page
periodically.</p>

<h3 class="sec">Contacting the Website</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices
of this site, or your dealings with this Website, you can contact us
on <a href="mailto:cpo@rightnow.com">cpo@rightnow.com</a>.</p>
