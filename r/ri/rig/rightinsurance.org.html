    	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we
            collect and use the personal information you provide to us and to assist you
            in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and
            services.
        </p>

        <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two
            types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose
            that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information
            collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Registration Information</em>
            <br>
            You will provide us information about yourself, your firm or company, and your
            practices when you use certain services on <a href="http://www.rightinsurance.org">www.rightinsurance.org</a> or register
            for email newsletters and alerts. You may also provide additional comments on
            how you see <a href="http://www.rightinsurance.org">www.rightinsurance.org</a> servicing
            your needs and interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Email Information</em>
            <br>
            If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email
            messages together with your email address and our responses.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Web Site Use Information</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site
            utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What
            Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web
            site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may
            include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web
            site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. We,
            our advertisers, and ad serving companies may also use small pieces of code
            called "web beacons" or
            "clear gifs" to determine which advertisements
            and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.
        </p>

        <h2>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h2>
        <p>
            Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes
            of administering and expanding our business activities, providing customer
            service, and making available other products and services to our customers
            and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information we
            collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services,
            and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any
            time if you do not wish to receive these offers by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@rightinsurance.org">support@rightinsurance.org</a> or
            by unsubscribing online by <a href="/unsubscribe">clicking here</a>.
        </p>

		<h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            A cookie is a very
            small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.
            When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for
            permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
            designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser
            if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy, your
            browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to
            you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
        </p>

		<h3>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            As you shop on our Web site, the site uses its
            cookies to differentiate you from other shoppers so your shopping cart is
            only available to you. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from
            seeing unnecessary advertisements or requiring you to log in more than is
            necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log
            files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web
            site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather
            feedback in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our
            customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about
            you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided
            to us in your cookies.
        </p>

		<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
            We may enter into alliances, partnerships, or other business arrangements
            with third parties who may be given access to personal information including
            your name, address, telephone number, and email for the purpose of providing
            you information regarding products and services that we think will be of
            interest to you. In connection with alliances, partnerships, or arrangements,
            we may also provide certain information to third parties if we have
            determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a
            responsible third party. For example, some of our partners operate stores or
            provide services on our site, while others power offerings developed by us
            for your use.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also use third parties to facilitate our business,
            including, but not limited to, sending email and processing credit card
            payments. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our
            partners and other third parties may have access to your personal information
            for use in connection with business activities. As we develop our business,
            we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor
            information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these
            types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of
            corporate divestitures, mergers, or any dissolution.
        </p>

		<h3>Notice of New Services and Changes</h3>
        <p>
            Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about
            important changes to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think
            you will find valuable. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to
            notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by sending us an email
            request at <a href="mailto:support@rightinsurance.org">support@rightinsurance.org</a>.
