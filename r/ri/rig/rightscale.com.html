  <p>Flexera Software produces software products that are accessible by individuals with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments.</p>
<p>Flexera Software understands that software applications are used by people with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments. Guidelines intended to ensure that software can be accessed by people having such impairments have been developed by Federal and Industry representatives. Flexera Software understands the importance of producing accessible software, and of adopting these guidelines. These guidelines are designed to ensure that our products are accessible by people with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments via user interface design, and assistive technology. Assistive technology includes numerous software and hardware tools, including: screen readers (which translate what's shown on a computer screen), refreshable Braille displays, screen magnification tools, and other tools.</p>
<p>Flexera Software addresses the accessibility of its software through an ongoing review process.</p>
<p>Flexera Software's products have interdependencies with the products of various other vendors. Our goal is to develop and maintain accessible products, but we cannot control the compliance of other software and hardware companies. The responsibility for accessibility lies with all software producers and high-tech manufacturers included in the solution.</p>
<p>The above statement does not constitute or extend the warranties for any of our products, which are exclusively contained in the license agreement under which our products are provided to our customers.</p>
