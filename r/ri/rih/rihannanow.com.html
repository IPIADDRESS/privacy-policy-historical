<p>This Policy describes how we treat personal information we collect both online and offline. This includes on our websites or in our apps. It also includes in phone or email interactions you have with us.</p>
<p><strong>We collect information from and about you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact information.</strong> For example, we might collect your name and street address. We might also collect your phone number or email.</p>
<p><strong>Information you post.</strong> For example, we collect information you post in a public space on our website or on a third-party social media site.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic information.</strong> We may collect information about events you like or products you buy. We might collect this as part of a survey, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Other information.</strong> If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you’re using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.</p>
<p><strong>We collect information in different ways.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We collect information directly from you.</strong> For example, if you register for a promotion. We also collect information if you post a comment on our websites or ask us a question.</p>
<p><strong>We collect information from you passively.</strong> We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. To learn more about these tools and to control them, please click here.</p>

<p><strong>We use information as disclosed and described here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We use information to respond to your requests or questions.</strong> For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for an event or contest. If you give us your friend’s information, we will only use it to provide services you requested.</p>

<p><strong>We will share information with our business partners.</strong> This includes a third party who provides or sponsors an event, or who operates a venue where we hold events. Our partners use the information we give them as described in their privacy policies. You should read those policies to learn how they treat your information.</p>
