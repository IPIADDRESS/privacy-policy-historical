<p class="c9"><span class="c7"></span></p>

</p>

Such information may include a user's IP address, username, user ID, pages viewed, items viewed, items purchased, transaction information (such as price, billing method, address).

Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when users visit certain web pages.&nbsp;Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept cookies, however, he may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he visits. </span>
</p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon. Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be able to collect information on such user.</span>
</p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0 c4">HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The information that we collect is used in order to analyze and provide our customers with an evaluation of whether a user may be engaging in fraudulent behavior or whether there is a risk that a transaction is fraudulent or unauthorized. Except for the information collected from our customer we may use information from different sources, including other customers or third party providers.</span>

</p>

<p class="c9 c17"><span class="c0"></span></p>

<p class="c13 c17"><span class="c0">Riskified may disclose information if it reasonably believe that it is legally required to do so or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

However, no security measures, as thorough as may be, are 100% perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess. </span>
</p>

<p class="c21 c13"><span class="c0 c4">POLICY TOWARDS CHILDREN</span></p>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
