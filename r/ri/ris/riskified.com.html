  <h1>Platform and Services Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="date">Last updated: Jan 1st 2013</div>

<p>
  Riskified Ltd. ("Riskified" "we", "our" or "us") has created a technology platform (the "Platform") and provides
  related services via the Platform (the "Service") that our customers, which are typically online merchants, use to
  prevent fraudulent and other transactions of risk. The Platform is designed to enable these customers through the use
  of information which we collect and analyze to help prevent fraudulent transactions.
</p>
<p>
  We respect the privacy of Internet users in general and wish to set forth in this Privacy Policy ("Policy")
  Riskified's practices in connection with the collection and use of information. Please note that this Policy applies
  only to Riskified and does not state the use practices or policies of our customers, of the websites on which our
  Platform is used, or of other third parties.
</p>
<p>
  This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Riskified does not own or control or to people it does
  not employ or manage.
</p>


<h2>What types of information do we collect?</h2>
<p>
  We collect information from our customers which may include personal information related to the users of our
  customer's services. Such information may include a user's IP address, username, user ID, pages viewed, items viewed,
  items purchased, transaction information (such as price, billing method, address). Our customers integrate our
  Platform on their websites which enables us to facilitate the collection of the information necessary to provide our
  fraud detection Services to our customers.
</p>
<p>
  Riskified uses cookies and web beacons and other similar technologies in connection with our Platform and Service.
  Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when users visit certain web pages. Most Internet browsers
  automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting
  cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept
  cookies, however, he may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he visits.
</p>
<p>
  Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon
  allows us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may
  choose to include with the beacon. Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be
  able to collect information on such user.
</p>

<h2>How do we use the information we collect?</h2>
<p>
  The information that we collect is used in order to analyze and provide our customers with an evaluation of whether a
  user may be engaging in fraudulent behavior or whether there is a risk that a transaction is fraudulent or
  unauthorized. Except for the information collected from our customer we may use information from different sources,
  including other customers or third party providers.
</p>

<h2>What information do we share with third parties?</h2>
<p>
  Riskified may use information for the use and development of its Platform and Services and for providing the Services
  to customers, including by third parties that provide services to Riskified for these purposes. Riskified does not
  sell, distribute or disclose personally identifiable information or information on individual users or customers.
</p>
<p>
  Riskified may disclose information if it reasonably believes that it is legally required to do so or in order to
  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited
  to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Riskified may share
  aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally,
  Riskified may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of
  assets, reorganization, or other corporate change.
</p>

<h2>Data storage and security</h2>
<p>
  All of the user data collected by Riskified is stored in such a manner that cannot be tracked back to specific
  individuals and information about a specific user cannot be retrieved; we maintain reasonable physical, electronic,
  and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use,
  modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction. However, no security measures, as thorough as may be, are 100% perfect
  and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or
  warrant the security of the information we possess.
</p>

<h2>Policy towards children</h2>
<p>
  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or
  guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or
  she should contact us at support@riskified.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us
  with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
</p>

<h2>Changes and consent to privacy policy</h2>
<p>
  We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy from time to time and it is therefore recommended to
  check it regularly. Any updates to our Policy are posted here.
</p>

<h2>Contacting us</h2>
<p>
  For any questions in regards to this Policy or Riskified's privacy practices, please contact our representatives at
  the following email and they will be more than happy to clarify and assist you in any way possible:
  support@riskified.com
</p>

<h2>Governing law</h2>
<p>
  This Policy shall be exclusively governed by and construed in all respects under the laws of the State of New York,
  without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law provisions. Any and all legal claims, suits or actions
  that arise in connection with this Policy or with breach of this Policy shall be submitted to the personal
  jurisdiction of the courts located in the courts of New York County.
</p>

  Information through the Site, you agree that your information may be transferred to third parties under such or
  similar circumstances.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>

  in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Site. We use cookies to enhance the user
  experience of our Site by means such as storing password or user preference information. If a user rejects the cookie,
  they may still use our Site with the only drawback being the disablement of some of the usability features of our
  Site. We may also use cookies to track and monitor usage of the Site by users for the purposes of marketing and Site
  improvement. The data collected from these cookies will never be shared with an external source and will be used for
  internal purposes only. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance
  of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
</p>

<h2>E-mail communications</h2>
<p>
  At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from Riskified, but you may not opt
  out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a
  registered user. You can opt out by either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the bottom
  of each email message.
</p>
<p>
  We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized
  third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have
  received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us at the e-mail below and we will investigate.
</p>

<h2>Policy towards children</h2>
<p>
  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or
  guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or
  she should contact us at support@riskified.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us
  with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during
  transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies,
  unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information may be
  compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Information and disclaim any assurance that such
  information will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain
  unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2>Changes and consent to privacy policy</h2>
<p>
  By registering with Riskified or by using the Site without prior registration, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
  Policy. We reserve the right to change the provisions of the Privacy Policy from time to time and you are therefore
  advised to check it regularly. Your continued use of the Site after any change to the policy constitutes your
  acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
  Our Site may have links to the sites of other companies. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. We
  encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
</p>

<h2>Update/delete user information</h2>
<p>
  You can write to us at any time to obtain a copy of your information and to have any inaccuracies corrected or if you
  no longer desire our service (in which case we will endeavour to remove your personal data provided to us). Where
  appropriate, you may have your Personal Information erased, rectified, amended or completed. In order to contact us
  regarding your information please e-mail support@riskified.com.
</p>
<p>
  To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or
  making corrections, however, you should protect your password from disclosure because anyone who gains access to your
  password may have access to, and may edit, your profile.
</p>

<h2>Governing law</h2>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy shall be exclusively governed by and construed in all respects under the laws of the State of New
  York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law provisions. Any and all legal claims, suits or
  actions that arise in connection with this Privacy Policy or with breach of this Privacy Policy shall be submitted to
  the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the courts of New York County.
