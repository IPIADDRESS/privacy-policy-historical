    <h1 style="color: #3da87b;">Platform and Services Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        We, atRiskified Ltd. ("Riskified" "we", "our" or "us") provide online merchants(a “Merchant”) a service that
        helps them
        prevent fraudulent online transactions ( the "Fraud Prevention"). Such Merchants may be very much the one you
        are now placing an order on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Merchants integrate our Fraud Prevention on their eCommerce websites and mobile apps where consumers like you
        place orders (“eCommerce Platform”). This enables us to collect personal data from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy ( the “Policy”) explains our privacypractices for our Fraud Prevention. It describes how we
        collect personal information, use it and share it and the rights and options available to you with respect to
        your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that this Policy does not cover the practices or policies of Merchants, the eCommerce Platforms, or
        of other parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not obligated by law to provide us with your personal data, but the eCommerce Platform may require that
        you provide us your personal data in order for it to be able to consider or process the order you place.
    </p>


    <h2>In short…</h2>
    <p>
        The following key points of the Privacy Policy are only brought for your convenience. They do not substitute the
        full Policy.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We collect various data regarding your transaction, device data, geolocation data, analytical data and
            cross-referenced data.
        </li>
        <li>You information is processed pursuant to your consent or the legitimate interests of the Merchant.</li>
        <li>We use the information first and foremost to analyze whether the transaction is fraudulent.</li>
        <li>We share your information mainly to operate the Fraud Prevention. For that purpose, we may share elements of
            the personal data we collect with third parties and operators of online publicly available data sources for
            cross-referencing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>The Merchant may use Riskified’s fraud assessment to decide whether to accept or decline your order based
            solely on automated processing.
        </li>
        <li>You may request to access your personal information, or have us update, correct or delete such information,
            if the law provides you those rights.
        </li>
        <li>We may store and process information outside the country where you are located.</li>
        <li>We retain the personal data we collect only for as long as needed in order to comply with our obligations
            under this Policy.
        </li>
        <li>Our data protection officer can be contacted at <a href="mailto:privacy@riskified.com" target="_blank">privacy@riskified.com</a>.
            You can also contact us at <a href="mailto:support@riskified.com" target="_blank">support@riskified.com</a>.

    <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>
        We, as the data controller, process your personal data pursuant to your consent or
        the legitimate interests of the Merchant. You may withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness
        of data processing we carried out based on your consent before such withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you place an order on an eCommerce Platform we crunch the aggregate data of your activities across the
            eCommerce Platforms of all Merchants we operate. We use this data to provide the eCommerce Platform a fraud
            analysis indicating whether or not the order is, in our assessment, a fraudulent online transaction. It is
            then up to the eCommerce Platform, not us, to determine in its own discretion, whether to accept and process
            your order, or decline it.
        </li>
        <li>Improving and enhancing Fraud Prevention and developing new services.</li>
        <li>Statistical analysis of consumers' activities.</li>
        <li>Handling complaints.</li>
        <li>Enforcing this Policy and preventing misuse of the Fraud Prevention.</li>
        <li>Taking any action in any case of dispute involving you, with respect or in relation to Fraud Prevention.
        </li>
        <li>As otherwise may be mandated by law or to protect our legal rights and property and those of third
            parties.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>SHARING INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
    <p>
        We may share the information outlined in this Policy with others, in the following instances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With our contractors and service providers, in order to help us to provide Fraud Prevention. For example, we
            process the data using cloud service providers.
        </li>
        <li>We may share limited elements of the personal data we collect with a number of third parties and operators
            of online publicly available data sources (such as online search engines, online ‘white pages’, online
            mapping services etc.). We do this in order to cross-reference, verify and enhance the accuracyofthe data we
            collect.
            <ul>
                <li>Those data sources may use the data we share with them for their own purposes, in accordance with
                    their own policies.
                </li>
                <li>Several of these data sources are companies operating in countries outside your local territory or
                    the European Economic Area, in legal environments that may not be adequate by EU data protection
                    standards. You may opt-outofhaving your personal data shared with those data sources. To exercise
                    this right please contact <a href="mailto:support@riskified.com" target="_blank">support@riskified.com</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            In seldom occasions, we may share limited elements of your personal data with the Merchant with whom the
            transaction was made, for review or audit purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your personal data may be shared with competent authorities and with any third party, if we believe it is
            required or is deemed justified by law to protect property or legitimate legal rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the operation of the Fraud Prevention is organized within a different framework, or through another legal
            structure or entity (such as due to a merger or acquisition).
        </li>
        <li>
            We may share personally identifiable information with our corporate group entities, but their use of such
            information must comply with the Policy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING</h2>
    <p>The eCommerce Platform may, in its own discretion, use Riskified’s fraud score assessment to make a decision on
        whether to accept or decline your order, based solely on automated processing. Please direct inquiries
        concerning the decision about your order to the eCommerce Platform.</p>

    <h2>ACCESSING, UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OBTAINING A COPY OF IT</h2>
    <p>If the law grants you such rights, you may ask to access the personal information about you that is stored in our
        systems. You may also ask for our confirmation as to whether or not we process personal data concerning you.</p>
    <p>Subject to the limitations in law, you may request that we update, correct or delete inaccurate or outdated
        information, and have us suspend the use of personal data whose accuracy you contest while we verify the status
        of that data.</p>
    <p>Subject to law, you may also be entitled to obtain from usthe personaldata you directly provided us (excluding
        data we obtained from other sources) in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and may have
        the right to transmit those data to another party.</p>
    <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@riskified.com" target="_blank">support@riskified.com</a>. When
        handling these requests, we may ask for additional information to confirm your identity and your request.</p>

    <h2>AGGREGATED INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We may usethe information we collect, as outlined above, to compile anonymized or de-identified information. We
        may share such anonymized or de-identified information with any other third party, at our sole discretion.
        However, we will not knowingly or intentionally share information that can be reasonably used to reveal your
        identity unless otherwise provided in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>TRANSFER OF DATA OUTSIDE YOUR TERRITORY</h2>
    <p>We may store and process information in the US, the EU, Israel and in other countries. We may also process
        information using cloud services.</p>
    <p>We frequently process the information under arrangements aimed at providing an adequate level of data protection,
        which include EU decisions recognizing the adequacy of those countries and model contract clauses.
    </p>
    <p>However, in certain cases the laws in some of these countries may nevertheless provide a lesser degree of data
        protection than the laws of your own country. You agree to the transfer of your information to such other
        countries for the purpose of processing as described in this Policy, including through cloud services.</p>

    <h2>Latest Platform and Services Privacy Policy Amendments</h2>
    <p>
        On June 19 we updated our Platform and Services Privacy Policy, as summarized below. Due to upcoming European
        legislation around privacy and data security, we have prepared a more detailed and in-depth privacy policy,
        detailing the different aspects of our processing of personal data in the course of providing our Services.
        Please
        read the full version of the Privacy Policy to familiarize yourself with how Riskified uses your data in order
        to
        provide its Services.
    </p>

    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>We detailed which data points we collect to provide our Service, whether or not we share such data and with
            whom, what we use the data for, and how.
        </li>
        <li>We also provided you with a more detailed explanation as to your rights in connection with the data we
            collect,
            and how you can contact us to make any required correction, thereby allotting you greater control over your
            own
            personal information.
        </li>
    </ul>

        systems or anonymize it, without further notice to you.</p>

        (unless the data is required for Riskified to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims).</p>

        us at <a href="mailto:support@riskified.com" target="_blank">support@riskified.com</a>. If we become aware that
        a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal data, we will delete such information from our files.
    </p>

    <h2>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
    <p>If we materially change this Policy in an adversely restrictive manner to your personal data, we will affect such

        cookie,
        they may still use our Site with the only drawback being the disablement of some of the usability features of
        our
        Site. We may also use cookies to track and monitor usage of the Site by users for the purposes of marketing and

        for

        acceptance
        of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
    </p>

    <h2>E-mail communications</h2>
    <p>
        At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from Riskified, but you may
        not
        opt
        out of administrative emails (for example, emails about your transactions or policy changes) while you are a
        registered user. You can opt out by either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the
        bottom
        of each email message.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not send emails to anyone without permission, and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any
        unauthorized
        third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you
        have
        received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us at the e-mail below and we will investigate.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy towards children</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent
        or
        guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he
        or
        she should contact us at support@riskified.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided
        us
        with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during
        transmission and once we receive it. However, due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving
        technologies,
        unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, the security of user information may
        be
        compromised at any time. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
        secure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of Personal Information and disclaim any assurance that
        such
        information will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain
        unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes and consent to privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        By registering with Riskified or by using the Site without prior registration, you agree to the terms of this
        Privacy
        Policy. We reserve the right to change the provisions of the Privacy Policy from time to time and you are
        therefore
        advised to check it regularly. Your continued use of the Site after any change to the policy constitutes your
        acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        Our Site may have links to the sites of other companies. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. We
        encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
    </p>

    <h2>Update/delete user information</h2>
    <p>
        You can write to us at any time to obtain a copy of your information and to have any inaccuracies corrected or
        if
        you
        no longer desire our service (in which case we will endeavour to remove your personal data provided to us).
        Where
        appropriate, you may have your Personal Information erased, rectified, amended or completed. In order to contact
        us
        regarding your information please e-mail support@riskified.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting
        access or
        making corrections, however, you should protect your password from disclosure because anyone who gains access to
        your
        password may have access to, and may edit, your profile.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing law</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy shall be exclusively governed by and construed in all respects under the laws of the State

        or
        actions that arise in connection with this Privacy Policy or with breach of this Privacy Policy shall be
