<div class="privacy-text">Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows
us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.
Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be able to collect information on such user.
