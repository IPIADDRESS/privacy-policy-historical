All information that is collected, provided to Oath or stored in your Oath Account will be treated, used and protected in accordance with the <a href="../../index.html">Oath Privacy Policy</a>. This information may change as Oath revises these Media Services by adding or removing features or using different service providers. Some features are only available if you are a registered user. Please visit <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/">Help</a> if you have questions about these Media Services.</p>

<p>This page describes specific privacy practices with respect to Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Autos, Yahoo Celebrity, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Movies, Yahoo Music, My Yahoo, Yahoo News, Rivals, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo View and Yahoo Weather.</p>

<h4 style="color:Black;"><strong>Information Collection &amp; Use Practices</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>We may personalize articles, videos, and other content shown to you based on your interests. We determine interests using what we may know about you, including information you provide to us directly, your browsing activity, watch history, items liked and followed, media consumed, and searches.</li>
	<li>Oath collects information about your activity on our services such as title queries, watch history and page views for product improvements, research and analysis, and to help provide you a more personalized experience.</li>
	<li>We offer suggestion and feedback options within our products which allow you to send us comments and feedback regarding our products. These forms may ask for various information to respond to your inquiry.</li>
	<li>On some Media Services, by default, we will send email notifications related to the service (for example, a fantasy sports game) in which you are participating. Some games provide you with controls for the type and frequency of these emails</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:Black;"><strong>Information Sharing &amp; Disclosure Practices</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Comments you make in the Media Services are public and may include your name, nickname, avatar, image and/or contact information associated with your account. These comments may also be surfaced to other users.</li>
	<li>You may share articles, videos, and other content using our email or other social media sharing features. When using these features, your name, user profile/name, and/or email address may be visible to the recipient(s).</li>
	<li>When you complete a form to receive more information (e.g., quotes, travel services, real estate services) from our partners and/or third parties, your information will be shared with, or in some cases collected directly by, these partners and/or third parties as described on those forms. To learn how they use your information, please review their respective privacy policies. They are solely responsible for their use of this information.</li>
	<li>Some features on Yahoo may be provided by <a href="../../topics/thirdparties/index.html">partners</a> that collect information from our site or from services associated with our site but hosted by the partner.</li>
	<li>We also analyze and store all other content and other information you provide when you use our Services</li>
	<li>This can also include information within or about the content you provide, such as <a href="../communications/faq/index.html">photos, attachments and other communications</a>. For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings, or EXIF information. This information allows us to improve our services and provide additional features and functionality.</li>
	<li>Some Media Services may collect your location to provide various services. This information may be used in accordance with our <a href="../../topics/location/index.html"> Location Privacy practices</a></li>

<h4 style="color:Black;"><strong>Information Collection and Use Practices</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Yahoo Answers collects information about your activity in both anonymous and information that on its own reasonably identifies you (such as your name or email address) - including specific questions, answers, comments, and votes.</li>
	<li>You can see your activity and watchlist, edit your preferences, find your Profile, and change your settings using Yahoo Answers <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my-activity">My Activity</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:Black;"><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure Practices</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>All activities outside of viewing and voting (asking, answering, and commenting) are assigned a name. This name can be:
	<ul>
		<li>Your Yahoo User ID;</li>
		<li>or any nickname you desire.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Your activities will be tied to the name you select.
	<ul>
		<li>You may change this name at any time and the name linked to all previous activity will be changed as well.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can make your Yahoo Messenger ID public in your profile.
	<ul>
		<li>By choosing to make your Yahoo Messenger ID public, all viewers of Yahoo Answers can link to your Yahoo Answers profile and there can see your Yahoo Messenger ID.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>All questions, answers, and comments created by you can be viewed by anyone visiting the Yahoo Answers site or visiting partner sites that include Yahoo Answers content.</li>
	<li>When enabling user-to-user emails in Yahoo Answers, your Yahoo User ID and email address are not shared.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color:Black;"><strong>Practices Regarding Your Ability to Update or Delete Information</strong></h4>

<ul>

		<li>Once the question is resolved, you cannot make changes or delete your content.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You can edit and delete answers while the question being asked is open.
