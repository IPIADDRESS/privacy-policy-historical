            (such as your name and email address) to River Past when choosing to participate

    <ul>
        <li>Cookies Information:When you visit the River Past Sites, we may send one or more
            cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to
            your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. River Past uses both session

            the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file
            directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
            You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
            is being sent. However, some features of the River Past Sites may not function properly
            if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Log File Information:When you use the River Past Sites, our servers automatically
            record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.
            These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
            ( IP ) address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs,
            platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the
            order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and
            time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear GIFs Information:When you use the River Past Sites, we may employ clear GIFs
            (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users
            anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may
            also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails
            are opened by recipients. </li>

            (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page,
            etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account
            name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos
            or send messages through the River Past Sites and other Users can contact you through
            messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the River Past Sites may be

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information
            so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you
            visit the River Past Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information;
            (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate
            metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your
            entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. </li>

    <ul>
        <li>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information
            to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the
            purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties
            agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we
            use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate
            confidentiality and security measures. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email
            address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use
            without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which

    <ul>
        <li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
            data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with
            interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for
            certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the
            River Past Sites. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable

            is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law)
            or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>River Past also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information
            and/or non-personally-identifiable information that River Past believes, in good
            faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="http://www.riverpast.com/en/about/tos/index.aspx">
                Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
            itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement

        Your Choices</p>
    <p>
        You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through
        the River Past Sites, in which case River Past may not be able to provide certain
        services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and
        email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note
        that webcam pictures uploaded by Users to the River Past Sites cannot be removed

            Terms of Use</a>.</p>
    <p>
        To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting

        Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</p>
    <p>
        River Past allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks,
        to serve advertisements within the River Past Sites. These third-party ad servers
        or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
        and links that appear on the River Past Sites. They automatically receive your IP
        address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
        JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements
        and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
    <p>
        River Past does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party
        ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program
        or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please
        note that if an advertiser asks River Past to show an advertisement to a certain
        audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages
        18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement,
        the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience
        they are trying to reach.</p>
    <p>
        You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers
        or ad networks. River Past's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control
        the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Commitment To Data Security</p>
    <p>
        River Past uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
        to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot,
        however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to River
        Past and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,
        River Past makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
        However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not
        be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
        technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
    <p>
        If River Past learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify
        you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. River Past
        may post a notice on the River Past Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending
        on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach
        in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw
        your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using this <a href="http://www.riverpast.com/en/about/contact/email/index.aspx">contact form</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</p>
    <p>
        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason,
        River Past does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information
        or non-personally-identifiable information on the River Past Sites from persons
        under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13.
        If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the River Past
        Sites at any time or in any manner. If River Past learns that personally identifiable
        information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the River Past
        Sites without verified parental consent, then River Past will take the appropriate
        steps to delete this information.</p>
    <p>

        In the event that River Past is acquired by or merged with a third party entity,
        we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information
        we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other
        change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
        receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of
        laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be
        able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
    <p>
        Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the
        effective date below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In

        our use or disclosure of the personal information you have already provided to us,
        we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect
        to such information.</p>
