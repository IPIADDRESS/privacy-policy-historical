<p><span class="content-normal">The Royal Bank of Scotland plc is a member of 
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group of companies and your personal information will

<p><span class="content-normal">When personal information is requested on-line 
by us, we ensure that your browser encrypts it. The strongest available 
encryption under the industry standard technology called SSL ("Secure Sockets

<p><b><span class="content-normal">Your Information On-line</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="content-normal">1. Cookies</span></b></p>
<p><span class="content-normal">A ‘cookie’ is information that a website stores 
on your computer so that it can remember something about you at a later time. 
Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your system.</span></p>
<p><span class="content-normal">The cookies used on the Royal Bank website do 
not include any information that others could read and understand about you, 
such as your name or account numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="content-normal">We currently use a combination of first party, 
third party, permanent and temporary cookies in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="content-normal">To collate general, non-personal management 
  information which is used to plan enhancements to our services. For example, 
  cookies help us to understand the popular paths that users take through the 
  Royal Bank website and how often people visit. Some of our general management 
  information is collected using third party tracking code provided by Red 
  Sheriff. We do not share information with other companies that use the same 
  third party tracking code or combine any data collected by Red Sheriff with 
  any personal information collected on the Royal Bank website. For more 
  information about how Red Sheriff collects data, please read the
  <a href="http://www.redsheriff.com/uk/content/privacy_1.html">Red Sheriff 
  Privacy Policy</a>.<br>

  <li><span class="content-normal">To evaluate the effectiveness of our 
  advertising and promotions on third party websites, we use DoubleClick as an 
  agent for promotion delivery and measurement. The Bank owns the anonymous data 
  that is collected and it is not shared with DoubleClick, or any other third

  <li><span class="content-normal">As a flag to help us recognise when we have 
  already asked you to participate in any on-line market research and to prevent 
  you from being asked to complete the same questionnaire everytime that you 
  visit the Royal Bank website.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="content-normal">If you do not want us to use cookies when you 
visit the Royal Bank website, you can configure your browser not to accept them

<p><span class="content-normal">When you apply for a product or service on the 
Royal Bank website, you will be asked for personal information that is needed to 
process your application.</span></p>
<p><span class="content-normal">The information that you provide will only be 
used for the purposes described at the time of your application and where 
applicable in the Terms and Conditions that apply to the relevant product or

yourself by "logging in" to Digital Banking.</span></p>
<p><span class="content-normal">Information that you provide, or that we can 
ascertain from the history of on-line transactions that you undertake using the 
service, will only be used to carry out your instructions and for the purposes
