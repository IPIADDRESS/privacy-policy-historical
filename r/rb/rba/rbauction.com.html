<a name="Links"><b>Links</b></a> 
<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that RBA is not 
  responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our

<hr>
<a name="Security"><b>Security</b></a> 
<p>Our website takes several precautions to protect our users' information. When 
  users submit sensitive information via our website, their information is protected 
  both online and off-line. </p>
<p>When users are asked to enter sensitive information (such as bidding and consigning 
  information), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard 
  encryption software. While on a secure page, ie. our rbauctionBid - Proxy 'Confirmation 
  - Terms of Bidding and Sale' page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers 
  such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as 
  opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about 
  the encryption software in use on our website, follow this <a href=" http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/www-security-faq.html">link</a>.</p>
<p> While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, 
  we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all of our users' information, 
  not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our 
  offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are 
  granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are required 
  to strictly observe our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers 
  and backup tapes on which we store personally identifiable information are kept 
  in a secure environment.</p>
<p><a href="#Contents" align="Right">TOP</a></p>
<hr>
<a name="SSUpdates"><b>Special Offers, and Site and Service Updates </b></a> 
<p>We may send registrants site and service announcement updates, and information 
  regarding new or improved services and upcoming events that we think may be 
  of interest to them. Registrants are not able to un-subscribe from these announcements. 
  We may communicate with a user to provide requested services or with respect 
  to their account via email or phone.<br>
</p>
<p><a href="#Contents" align="Right">TOP</a></p>
<hr>
<a name="ChangeClientInfo"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></a> 
<p>A registrant may change or update its personally identifiable information or 
  remove itself from our service, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@rbauction.com?"> 
  info@rbauction.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#Contents" align="Right">TOP</a></p>
<hr>
<a name="OptOut"><b>Choice / Opt-Out</b></a> 
<p>When registering for access to the Member Services section of the website, 
  users can de-select the checkbox that asks if they would like periodic email 
  marketing notices (rbauctionUpdates), however, as mentioned in the Special Offers, 
  and Site and Service Updates section, some messages are not optional for web 
  site registrants.</p>
<p>To ensure that you do not receive optional email notifications, please send 
  an email to <a href="mailto:events@rbauction.com">events@rbauction.com</a>

<p>By using the RBA website and services, you signify your acceptance of this 
  Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Your continued 
  use of any portion of the RBA website following notification or posting of such 
  changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes.</p>
<p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to our Privacy 
  Statement web page and update the date listed on the links to it, as well as 
  on the statement itself. We will post those changes so users are always aware 
  of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
  if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information 
  was collected. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information 
  in a manner different from that currently stated, we will notify users by email.
