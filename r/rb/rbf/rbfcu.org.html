	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Privacy Concerns of Our Members</h2>
	<p>Your privacy and security concerning your personal affairs is of the utmost importance to us. We have implemented standards and procedures designed to prevent the misuse of the nonpublic personal information you have entrusted to us. These standards and procedures are based on applicable federal laws and Texas state statutes that will govern how we handle your account with us. The Privacy Policy explains what information Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) and our affiliates collect, when we share it, and how we protect it.</p>
	<h1>Online Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Understanding how important personal privacy is to you when you visit our website, we have adopted the following Online Privacy Policy, in order to better serve you, our valued member.</p>
	<h2>Collection and Retention of Member Information when Using NetBranch</h2>
	<p>We will automatically collect information from "cookies," which are electronic files that capture information about you when you access our online services. Examples are the date and time of your visit, the Internet provider address you were assigned, and the pages you access on our website. If you participate in any surveys and/or site registrations, we will retain that information as well. The information we obtain from you will remain strictly confidential, as we do not disclose cookie information to non-affiliated third parties. Examples of how member information may be used include, but are not limited to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>To improve our website;</li>
			<li>To notify you about updates or enhancements to our website;</li>
			<li>To contact you for special promotions; or</li>
			<li>To keep you informed of developments in the Credit Union Movement</li>
		</ol>	
	<p>While most web browsers automatically accept "cookies," users are capable of preventing their web browser from using the cookies stored in their personal computer's hard drive. Since cookies are required to maintain a secure Internet connection between you and our website, please be aware that if you disable cookies, or these small files of information from being deposited on your computer, you may encounter difficulty using certain features of our website.</p>
	<h2>E-Mail Security</h2>
	<p>If you choose to provide us with your e-mail address, it will be used in the manner specified by you. This information will not be sold to third parties. If you authorize it, we will provide your e-mail address to a third party vendor we hire to provide services to you. If at any time you wish to change your preference regarding how your e-mail is used, you may contact us using the <a href="mailto:memberservices@rbfcu.org">memberservices@rbfcu.org</a> online address.</p>
	<p>E-mail sent to RBFCU may be used by the credit union's staff and volunteers to answer questions, to follow up on suggestions, or to improve the level of service RBFCU provides. However, users are advised that e-mail may not be secured and is subject to interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, if you wish to communicate sensitive or personal information, we ask that you send it by traditional postal mail. Should you choose to request sensitive or confidential information from us via unsecured Internet e-mail, your message will be considered as permission for us to provide the requested information in the same manner. Users accept full liability for the risks associated with either their messages or our responses being intercepted or altered by unauthorized third parties.</p>
	<h2>Our Security Procedures to Protect Information</h2>
	<p>To help prevent unauthorized access to your nonpublic personal information, we uphold the security standards detailed in this Privacy Policy and the NetBranch Online User Agreement for all online transactions.</p>
	<p>Our transactional website only supports web browsers having a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption level.</p>
	<h2>Consent</h2>
	<p>All network traffic on this system is constantly monitored for security, copyright, and statistical purposes. By accessing our website, users consent to security testing and monitoring necessary to improve the protection of information and its integrity. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, to download this entire website, or otherwise cause damage are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and any other applicable local, state, federal and/or international laws.</p>
	<h1>General Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Information We Collect and Disclose about You</h2>
	<p>We are committed to providing competitive products and services to meet your financial needs, which necessitates that we share information about you to complete your transactions and to provide certain financial opportunities that we believe may be of value and interest to you. In order to do so, we may share some information, excluding information collected from consumer reporting agencies, with our affiliates. We also have agreements with other companies that provide either services to us or additional financial products for your consideration. Given these arrangements, we may disclose all of the information we collect as described in the paragraphs that follow, except as noted above, to our affiliates and to companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</p>
	<p>To protect our members' privacy, we only work with companies that consent to strong confidentiality agreements. These companies act on our behalf and are contractually obligated to keep the information we share confidential and use it only for specific services that we have asked them to perform for us. As part of the strict confidentiality and security provisions in our contracts with companies outside of the Randolph-Brooks FCU family, these companies are prohibited from reusing, disclosing, or selling the information we provide them to other third parties.</p>
	<p>We collect the following nonpublic personal information about you from a variety of sources and may disclose all the information we collect, except information collected from consumer reporting agencies, to our affiliates:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Randolph Brooks Services Group, LLC – makes available investment and insurance financial products and services</li>
			<li>Randolph Brooks Title Company, LLC – makes available title insurance and real estate loan closing services</li>
			<li>Randolph Brooks Insurance Agency, LLC – makes available auto and homeowner's insurance</li>
			<li>CU Realty of Texas LLC makes available real estate brokerage services</li>
		</ul>
	<p>We may also disclose all the information we collect to our marketing, data processing, and online bill payment affiliates, other 3rd party companies, or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>From membership and loan applications and other forms, we obtain information you provide such as name, address, Social Security Number, and income.</li>
			<li>From your transactions with us, our affiliates, or other 3rd party companies that work closely with us to provide you with financial products and services, we obtain information such as your account balances, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage.</li>
			<li>From consumer reporting agencies, we obtain information such as your creditworthiness and credit history. </li>
			<li>From verifications of information you provide on applications and other forms, we obtain information from current or past employers, other financial institutions, and other sources listed on the application.</li>
		</ul>	
	<p>In all instances, we only disclose the limited information necessary to perform these services and do not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted by law. These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of your credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize, or protect the security of our financial records.</p>
	<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
	<p>Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and member privacy. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a specific business purpose in using your data. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and industry practices to protect your nonpublic personal information.</p>
	<h2>Terminating Your RBFCU Membership</h2>
	<p>For more than 50 years, members have trusted Randolph-Brooks FCU with their personal and financial information. Whether you are a current or former member, our commitment to conduct business with your best interest at heart remains unchanged. If you terminate your membership with us, we will not share or sell information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.</p>
	<h2>We Respect Your Privacy</h2>
	<p>As an added service to our members, we would like to make you aware that the national credit reporting bureaus offer a toll-free number to enable consumers to opt-out of all pre-approved credit offers just by making one telephone call. If you would like to restrict these third parties from obtaining your information from consumer reporting agencies and using for marketing purposes, please call 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).</p>
	<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>We will revise our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice; however, all significant changes will be posted to this website. As a result, we encourage you to periodically check this web page for changes when accessing our website. NO PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL BE DETERMINED TO CHANGE OR ALTER ANY OTHER CONTRACTS OR POLICIES BETWEEN RANDOLPH-BROOKS FEDERAL CREDIT UNION AND ITS MEMBERS.</p>
	<h2>Contact the Randolph-Brooks Family</h2>
	<p>We welcome any questions or comments you may have concerning our Privacy Policy. You may contact us by e-mail at memberservices@rbfcu.org, or by calling our Member Service Center at (210) 945-3300 or 800-580-3300.</p>
