<p>RJMetrics Inc. (“RJMetrics”) is strongly committed to protecting and respecting your privacy rights. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) sets out the basis on which RJMetrics collects and uses personal data from visitors to our website located at www.rjmetrics.com (the “Site”) and subscribers to our newsletter and services available through the Site. Use of the Site constitutes your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please review it carefully before submitting any information to RJMetrics through the Site. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.</p>
<h3>Safe Harbor Certification</h3>
<p>In light of the international nature of our business, RJMetrics complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. RJMetrics has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. For more information about the Safe Harbor program, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>
<h3>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</h3>
<p>RJMetrics collects data, such as name, address, e-mail address, fax and telephone numbers, employer and credit card information (collectively, “Personally Identifiable Information”), from you, through the registration forms on the RJMetrics Sales Site. RJMetrics may keep a record of any correspondence with you until it is no longer necessary. RJMetrics may retain copies of all information that you provide through the Site, both during your use of the Site and any services available through the Site and after termination or expiration of such use. RJMetrics may also ask you to complete surveys for research purposes and may keep a copy of your responses. Please note that you are not obliged to respond to such surveys.</p>
<h3>Are Cookies and Log files used?</h3>
<p>RJMetrics may collect information about your computer and browsing preferences, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type. In some circumstances, RJMetrics uses cookies to enhance the functionality of the Site. A cookie is a small data file on the hard drive of your computer. RJMetrics uses cookies to identify a customer and to store registration details so that the customer is no longer required to re-enter these details on subsequent visits. In addition, RJMetrics uses cookies to indicate the number of computers used by each customer to log-in to the Site, and to prevent abuse of the Site and logins. RJMetrics also collects information on referring websites, IP addresses and web browsers used by customers when they access the Site, and uses such information for the same reasons mentioned above. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts or functionality of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, the Site will issue cookies when you log on to the Site. Please note that RJMetrics may use technology service providers to help monitor Site usage. Some of these service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information through cookies on RJMetrics’ behalf.</p>
<h3>Uses made of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>RJMetrics may use information collected from you for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For direct marketing campaigns, as permitted by law; RJMetrics will give you the option<br>
to opt out of each commercial email communication that it sends to you;</li>

RJMetrics feels may interest you, where you have consented for such purposes;</li>
<li>To customize the Site to your preferences;</li>
<li>To provide you with services available through the Site, for which you register;</li>
<li>To develop new features of the Site and services available through the Site, and for testing<br>
and other development purposes that do not involve disclosure to third parties;</li>
<li>To carry out RJMetrics’ obligations under any contracts with you;</li>
<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of the Site, when you choose to do<br>
so; and</li>
<li>To notify you about the changes to the Site or any services available through the Site,<br>
including new product announcements.</li>
<li>To conduct internal administration of RJMetrics’s business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does RJMetrics disclose Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties?</h3>
<p>RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third party vendors used by RJMetrics for customer relationship management purposes, including the distribution of email communications. RJMetrics does not permit third party vendors to use Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose outside of those disclosed within this Privacy Policy. RJMetrics may disclose the names of Users of the Site to enquiring parties only if the enquiring party is from the same organization as the User.</p>
<p>In addition, RJMetrics may disclose your personal data to third parties under the<br>
following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the event that RJMetrics sells or buys any business or assets, in which case RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
<li>If RJMetrics or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case<br>
Personally Identifiable Information held by it about its customers will be one of the<br>
transferred assets;</li>
<li>If RJMetrics is under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation;</li>
<li>To protect the rights, property or safety of RJMetrics or its customers, which includes<br>
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud<br>
protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>RJMetrics may use all Dashboard Usage Data, including that which is specific to User, and the Business Data for the purpose of creating aggregated and anonymized statistics on the RJMetrics customer base (the “Aggregate Data”). RJMetrics shall be the sole owner of the Aggregate Data and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall be free to use and disclose the Aggregate Data at its discretion. Aggregate Data shall not include the User’s Business Data unless it has first been aggregated with data belonging to other RJMetrics clients, shall not identify User as the source of any specific piece of data, and shall not include any Personally Identifiable Information or data specific to any individual identified in User’s Business Data.</p>
<h3>Securing your personal data</h3>
<p>RJMetrics takes reasonable steps to protect your Personally Identifiable Information as you transmit such information from your computer to the Site, and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to the Site via e-mail or other electronic means. Where RJMetrics has given you a username and/or password which enables you to access certain parts of the RJMetrics website, you are responsible for keeping such username and/or password confidential.</p>
<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
<p>The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external websites. RJMetrics encourages you to review the privacy and security policies of any externally linked websites that may be accessed through the Site. RJMetrics assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection and disclosure practices of any external websites that a User can access through the Site. Please check the privacy policies of these external websites before you submit any Personally Identifiable Information or other information to them.</p>
<h3>Can I change my information?</h3>
<p>To keep your Personally Identifiable Information accurate, current and complete, please contact us via the email address on the About Us page. RJMetrics shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your data access request within 30 days of receiving your request. If RJMetrics is unable to respond to your request within such period RJMetrics shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of the reason why RJMetrics is so unable. Should you choose to unsubscribe from any mailing lists for which you registered, you may do so by following the instructions on how to unsubscribe provided in all RJMetrics communications.</p>
<h3>Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents</h3>
<p>RJMetrics abides by the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union member countries and Switzerland. However, it is important to note that the servers that store the information are operated in the United States or at one of our other data centers located outside the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information provided to us may be transferred to the United States. Unless you are a resident of the European Union or Switzerland, your use of the Site and your provision of information to us in any manner will be construed as consent to such transfers.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Safe Harbor framework, RJMetrics commits to the resolution of complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your information. We have committed to resolve any complaints by European Union and Swiss citizens relating to this Privacy Policy, which cannot be resolved directly by our company, through the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.’s Safe Harbor Privacy Dispute Resolution Procedures.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below. We will investigate your question, respond to your inquiry, and attempt to resolve any concerns regarding your privacy question. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>RJMetrics reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. You should check this Privacy Policy each time you use the Site to determine if any changes have been made. If you use the Site after the amended Privacy Policy has been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to the amended Privacy Policy.</p>
