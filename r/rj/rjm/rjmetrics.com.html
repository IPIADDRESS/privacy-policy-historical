					<p>RJMetrics Website Visitor Privacy Policy</p>
					<p>Last updated: October 13, 2008</p>

					<p>RJMetrics Inc. ("RJMetrics") is strongly committed to protecting and respecting your privacy 
						rights. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") sets out the basis on which RJMetrics 
						collects and uses personal data from visitors to our website located at www.rjmetrics.com 
						(the "Site") and subscribers to our newsletter and services available through the Site. Use 
						of the Site constitutes your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please review it 
						carefully before submitting any information to RJMetrics through the Site.</p>
						
					<p>The Website Visitor Privacy Policy is broken down into several key areas for your convenience:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><a href="./">What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</a></li>
						<li><a href="./">Are Cookies and Log files used?</a></li>
						<li><a href="./">Uses made of Personally Identifiable Information</a></li>
						<li><a href="./">Does RJMetrics disclose Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties?</a></li>
						<li><a href="./">Where RJMetrics stores your Personally Identifiable Information</a></li>
						<li><a href="./">Securing your personal data</a></li>

					<h3>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</h3>

					<p>RJMetrics collects data, such as name, address, e-mail address, fax and telephone numbers, employer 
						and credit card information (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information"), from you, through 
						the registration forms on the RJMetrics Sales Site. RJMetrics may keep a record of any correspondence 
						with you until it is no longer necessary. RJMetrics may retain copies of all information that you 
						provide through the Site, both during your use of the Site and any services available through the 
						Site and after termination or expiration of such use. RJMetrics may also ask you to complete surveys 
						for research purposes and may keep a copy of your responses. Please note that you are not obliged to 
						respond to such surveys.</p>
					
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>

					<h3>Are Cookies and Log files used?</h3>

					<p>RJMetrics may collect information about your computer and browsing preferences, including, where 
						available, your IP address, operating system and browser type. In some circumstances, RJMetrics uses 
						cookies to enhance the functionality of the Site. A cookie is a small data file on the hard drive of 
						your computer. RJMetrics uses cookies to identify a customer and to store registration details so that 
						the customer is no longer required to re-enter these details on subsequent visits. In addition, 
						RJMetrics uses cookies to indicate the number of computers used by each customer to log-in to the Site, 
						and to prevent abuse of the Site and logins. RJMetrics also collects information on referring websites, 
						IP addresses and web browsers used by customers when they access the Site, and uses such information for 
						the same reasons mentioned above. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your 
						browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may 
						be unable to access certain parts or functionality of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser 
						setting so that it will refuse cookies, the Site will issue cookies when you log on to the Site. Please 
						note that RJMetrics may use technology service providers to help monitor Site usage. Some of these 
						service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information through cookies on RJMetrics’ 
						behalf.</p>

							to opt out of each commercial email communication that it sends to you;</span></li>
						<li><span>To provide you with information and services that you request from RJMetrics or which 
							RJMetrics feels may interest you, where you have consented for such purposes;</span></li>
						<li><span>To customize the Site to your preferences;</span></li>
						<li><span>To provide you with services available through the Site, for which you register;</span></li>

						<li><span>To carry out RJMetrics’ obligations under any contracts with you;</span></li>
						<li><span>To allow you to participate in interactive features of the Site, when you choose to do

					<h3>Does RJMetrics disclose Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties?</h3>

					<p>RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third party vendors used by 
						RJMetrics for customer relationship management purposes, including the distribution of email 
						communications. RJMetrics does not permit third party vendors to use Personally Identifiable 
						Information for any purpose outside of those disclosed within this Privacy Policy. RJMetrics 
						may disclose the names of users of the Site to enquiring parties only if the enquiring party 
						is from the same organization as the user.</p>

					<p>In addition, RJMetrics may disclose your personal data to third parties under the 
						following circumstances:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><span>In the event that RJMetrics sells or buys any business or assets, in which case RJMetrics may 
							disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such 
							business or assets;</span></li>
						<li><span>If RJMetrics or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case 
							Personally Identifiable Information held by it about its customers will be one of the 
							transferred assets;</span></li>
						<li><span>If RJMetrics is under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with 
							any legal obligation;</span></li>
						<li><span>To protect the rights, property or safety of RJMetrics or its customers, which includes 
							exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud 
							protection and credit risk reduction.</span></li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>RJMetrics may combine your Personally Identifiable Information with that of RJMetrics’ other users, 
						for the purpose of creating aggregate usage statistics which do not identify you as the source of 
						any specific piece of data (the "Aggregate Data"). RJMetrics shall be the sole owner of the Aggregate 
						Data and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall be free to use and disclose the Aggregate 
						Data at its discretion.</p>
					
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>
					
					<h3>Where RJMetrics stores your Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

					<p>By submitting Personally Identifiable Information to RJMetrics, you consent to the transfer and 
						storage of such Personally Identifiable Information for processing by RJMetrics in a country of 
						its choosing, including, but not limited to, the United States. RJMetrics will take reasonable 
						steps to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is stored in accordance with this 
						Privacy Policy.</p>
					
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>

					<h3>Securing your personal data</h3>

					<p>RJMetrics takes reasonable steps to protect your Personally Identifiable Information as you transmit 
						such information from your computer to the Site, and to protect such information from loss, misuse, 
						and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You should keep in mind, however, 
						that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from 
						the Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information 
						you send to the Site via e-mail or other electronic means. Where RJMetrics has given you a username 
						and/or password which enables you to access certain parts of the RJMetrics website, you are responsible 
						for keeping such username and/or password confidential. </p>
					
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>

					<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>

					<p>The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external websites. RJMetrics encourages you to 
						review the privacy and security policies of any externally linked websites that may be accessed 
						through the Site. RJMetrics assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection 
						and disclosure practices of any external websites that a user can access through the Site. Please 
						check the privacy policies of these external websites before you submit any Personally 
						Identifiable Information or other information to them.</p>
					
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>
					
					<h3>Can I change my information?</h3>

					<p>To keep your Personally Identifiable Information accurate, current and complete, please contact us via 
						the email form on the About Us page. RJMetrics shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to 
						your data access request within 30 days of receiving your request. If RJMetrics is unable to respond to 
						your request within such period RJMetrics shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of 
						the reason why RJMetrics is so unable. Should you choose to unsubscribe from any mailing lists for which 
						you registered, you may do so by following the instructions on how to unsubscribe provided in all 
						RJMetrics communications.</p>
					<a href="./" class="top">Back to top</a>

					<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

					<p>RJMetrics reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. You should 
						check this Privacy Policy each time you use the Site to determine if any changes have been made. If you 
						use the Site after the amended Privacy Policy has been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to 
						the amended Privacy Policy.</p>

						you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any information through the Site. We encourage 
						parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this
