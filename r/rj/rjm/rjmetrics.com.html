			<p><a name="cookies">Are Cookies and Log files used?</a><br>

				RJMetrics may collect information about your computer and browsing preferences, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type. 

				In some circumstances, RJMetrics uses cookies to enhance the functionality of the Site. A cookie is a small data file on the hard drive of your computer. RJMetrics uses cookies to identify a customer and to store registration details so that the customer is no longer required to re-enter these details on subsequent visits.

			<p><a name="infodisclose">Does RJMetrics disclose Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties?</a><br>
				RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third party vendors used by RJMetrics for customer relationship management purposes, including the distribution of email communications. RJMetrics does not permit third party vendors to use Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose outside of those disclosed within this Privacy Policy.

				</p><p>In addition, RJMetrics may disclose your personal data to third parties under the following circumstances:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the event that RJMetrics sells or buys any business or assets, in which case RJMetrics may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
					<li>If RJMetrics or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personally Identifiable Information held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets;</li>

RJMetrics assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection and disclosure practices of any external websites that a user can access through the Site. Please check the privacy policies of these external websites before you submit any Personally Identifiable Information or other information to them.<br><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
