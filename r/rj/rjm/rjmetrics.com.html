RJMetrics does not permit third party vendors to use Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose outside of those disclosed within this Privacy Policy.

	<p>RJMetrics takes reasonable steps to protect your Personally Identifiable Information as you transmit such information from your computer to the Site, and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You should keep in mind, however, that no internet transmission is 100% secure or error-free.

However, it is important to note that the servers that store the information are operated in the United States or at one of our other data centers located outside the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information provided to us may be transferred to the United States. Unless you are a resident of the European Union or Switzerland, your use of the Site and your provision of information to us in any manner will be construed as consent to such transfers.
