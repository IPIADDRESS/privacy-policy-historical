<p><strong><a name="cookie_use"></a>HOW WE USE COOKIES<br></strong>Our Website uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. These technologies and the information collected about you may be used to track your activity across multiple devices. Where appropriate, we use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to enter the same information repeatedly.</p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of text that is placed on your computer’s hard drive. Depending on the settings you have selected, your browser adds the text to your device as a small file. Many browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies as you prefer. The Help portion of your web browser, most likely found on the toolbar, typically tells you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Note that disabling or declining cookies may prevent the use of certain features of our website, including the ability to login to a site.</p>
<p><strong><a name="analytics"></a>ANALYTICS / LOG FILES<br></strong>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information in order to personalize our communications with you.</p>
<p><strong><a name="advertising"></a>TARGETED DISPLAY ADVERTISING BY RSAC AND OTHERS<br></strong>RSAC also use cookies and Internet browsing to help us display personalized content and appropriate advertising during your visits to third party websites. For example, if you view an event or content on our Website, you may see offers for similar items on other websites you visit. Cookies placed by our third-party partners also assist us with measuring the performance of our advertising campaigns, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page. These cookies can be effective whether you are on RSAconference.com or another website. If you opt out of receiving targeted display advertising, the data associated with these cookies will not be used.<a id="_anchor_18" name="_msoanchor_18" href="file://nashprd102v3/RSA_Experiential_Marketing/RSA%20Conferences/Tech%20Team/Website/Privacy%20Statement/RSA%20Conference%20Privacy%20Statement%20DRAFT_bg%20022019_cc_02.21.19.docx#_msocom_18"></a></p>
<p>These cookies assist the third parties in identifying the pages you view, the links and ads you click on, other actions you take on those web pages, and the site from which you came before arriving at a web page.</p>
<p>To enable you to opt-out of interest-based advertising delivered by partners working with RSAC, or to customize your experience on our Website, please navigate to the main page and select “Cookie Consent” at the bottom of the page. If you opt-out, you may still see RSAC ads on other websites, but those ads will not be customized to you by RSAC or our partners.</p>
<p><strong><a name="do_not_track"></a>“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS<br></strong>Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising through the RSAC Manage Cookies webpage and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described in the “How We Use Cookies” section above, some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. RSAC does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Statement. For more information about “do not track,” visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org/">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="beacons"></a>HOW WE AND OUR PARTNERS USE WEB BEACONS, PIXEL TAGS AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY<br></strong>RSAC may use web beacons, pixel and tags on our website, in our email messages, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others’ email messages.</p>
<p>A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or email message. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our Website and our advertising in various ways. For example, web beacons may count the number of individuals who visit our Website from a particular advertisement, or who make a purchase from our Website after viewing a particular advertisement, or they may tell us when a web page is viewed and provide a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons may also measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an email message, determining when an email message is opened and determining how many times an email message is forwarded. Subject to local laws, we may combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other Personal Information we have collected from you.</p>
<p>The information we collect through web beacons may include some limited Personal Information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing RSAC cookies. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our Website and undertake internal research.<a id="_anchor_24" name="_msoanchor_24" href="file://nashprd102v3/RSA_Experiential_Marketing/RSA%20Conferences/Tech%20Team/Website/Privacy%20Statement/RSA%20Conference%20Privacy%20Statement%20DRAFT_bg%20022019_cc_02.21.19.docx#_msocom_24"></a></p>
<p>You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies in your web browser as described in the&nbsp;<strong>How We and Our Partners Use Cookies</strong>&nbsp;section above.<a id="_anchor_26" name="_msoanchor_26" href="file://nashprd102v3/RSA_Experiential_Marketing/RSA%20Conferences/Tech%20Team/Website/Privacy%20Statement/RSA%20Conference%20Privacy%20Statement%20DRAFT_bg%20022019_cc_02.21.19.docx#_msocom_26"></a></p>
