</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>At Constant Contact, we respect and protect the privacy of our customers and those who use our website. The following Privacy Statement provides details about how your personal information is collected and used. This privacy statement applies to the Constant Contact website, products and services that are located in, but not limited to the roving.com and constantcontact.com domains. </p>

<p>Constant Contact is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an independent, organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this privacy statement, you should first contact Constant Contact as described below. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at 
<a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.constantcontact.com" target="_blank">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=http://www.constantcontact.com</a>.
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p>Constant Contact complies with the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and the Swiss Confederation.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use by Constant Contact</h2>

<p>Constant Contact is the sole owner of information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Constant Contact collects information from our users at several different points on our website. </p>

<p>Our website offers several opportunities for visitors to register for promotional and informational mailings, online webinars and resources, and for assistance in evaluating our products and services. These registration forms enable users to opt-in to Constant Contact's mailing lists and require users to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this contact information to send information about our company and our products and services. Notice is given at the point of collection to enable users to choose whether or not they consent to the usage terms. Those who have signed up and subsequently wish to withdraw their participation may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below).</p>

<p>We also keep track of activity on our website via log files stored on our web servers. We collect information such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our site and any links you click on to leave our site. We use our logs of your website activity to assist us in offering you a personalized Web experience, to assist you with technical support, to diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website and to tailor our product and service offerings to you.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use by Our Customers</h2>

<p>You may be asked to provide certain personal information to our customers in connection with their use of our products and services, such as when you respond to a survey or register for an event. If you choose to provide personal information to one of our customers, you should review the individual privacy policy of that customer. Our customers may upload contact information they have collected through other means.  This information may contain third party personal information such as email addresses. Constant Contact is not responsible for the privacy practices of our customers.</p>

<h2>Security and Privacy</h2>

<p>We take every precaution to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. When we collect sensitive account information such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

<p>Constant Contact takes care to reinforce the importance of our website visitors' security and privacy among our employees. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.</p>

<p>We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information with third parties for their promotional use. Occasionally, we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing customer service). The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may also disclose certain information to partners who introduced you to Constant Contact's services. Lastly, we may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>

<p>We use a variety of technologies on our sites. Among these are cookies: a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember your browser in the future. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a unique number. When you visit our website, open our email, or encounter our services online (perhaps on a customer's website) we may send you a cookie. Cookies may be used in many ways: they allow us to verify the login status of customers using products or services linked directly with our website, track point of entry to point of registration for those users participating in our affiliate signup programs, and track and measure the success of a particular marketing campaign. Cookies also allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer, enabling us to make your visit to our website easier by recognizing you when you return and helping to provide you with a customized experience.</p>

<p>Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you may still use our site; however, you may have limited access to some areas within our website. For more information on how to manage cookies in your web browser, see <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>. We also provide you with an option to opt-out of receiving certain cookies associated with our online advertising. See "Online Advertising" below.</p>

<p>Some of our web pages, emails, and other online content may contain electronic images known as web beacons, also known as single-pixel GIFs, which are invisible graphical images. These web beacons allow us to count users who have visited our web pages, seen our ads, or opened our email. Web beacons collect only limited information, such as a cookie identifier, time and date of a page being viewed, and a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides (the URL).</p>

<p>Flash cookies are also created by certain content on our pages using Adobe® Flash®, such as product tutorials. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies see, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>
When we send you emails, we may include a web beacon to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails. When you click on a link in an email, we record this individual response to allow us to customize our offerings to you.</p>

<p>Web Beacons cannot be declined when delivered via a regular web page. However, Web Beacons can be refused when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text only) emails via your email software.</p>

<h2>Online Advertising</h2>

<p>We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partners; they enable our partners to recognize a unique ad impression cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. With both cookies and web beacons, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
We give all internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving our ad impression cookie. If you opt out, your web browser will be associated with a generic "opt-out" cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personally identifiable information with your browser. Our "opt-out" cookie has no expiration date. Keep in mind that participating in our opt-out program does not prevent you from seeing our online ads; instead, information about the online ads we serve to you will not be recorded. If you wish to opt-out of receiving this cookie, please <a href="/opt-out-info.jsp">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Our ad management partners include Mediaplex, Google, Advertising.com, 24/7 Real Media, Collective Media, Media6Degrees, TURN and DataXu. For more information about our ad management partners, including information about how to opt-out of these technologies, visit the privacy policies on their websites.</p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>

<p>Constant Contact's Anti-Spam Policy tolerates only permission-based email See <a href="/uidocs/CCSpamPolicy.jsp">http://www.constantcontact.com/uidocs/CCSpamPolicy.jsp</a>. Users always have the opportunity to opt-out or change preferences via a link in the footer of all non-transactional email messages. These options are made available when you sign-up for our email lists and in email messages delivered from our company. Alternatively, you may email us at <a href="mailto:support@constantcontact.com" rel="nofollow">support@constantcontact.com</a>. In addition, anyone receiving emails from Constant Contact on behalf of our customers always has the opportunity to opt-out of email messages via the opt-out link included in the link in the footer of the message. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited commercial email from Constant Contact on behalf of any of our customers, you may report it to us at <a href="mailto:abuse@constantcontact.com">abuse@constantcontact.com</a>.</p>

<p>Some communications (e.g. important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for all Constant Contact customers. You must cancel your Constant Contact account to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your Constant Contact account, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@constantcontact.com" rel="nofollow">support@constantcontact.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>

<p>You can update your account information, including your organizational information and email address, by logging in and then clicking on the My Settings tab. Account information such as your user name and password can be changed by logging in and then clicking on the My Account link at the top of page. The My Account page is also where you can manage product subscriptions and billing information such as your credit card number. If you would like to deactivate your account, you can do so by contacting customer support by email at support@constantcontact.com or by telephone at 1 (866) 289-2101.</p>

<h2>ConnectUp! Online Community</h2>

<p>ConnectUp! provides users the opportunity to participate in discussions with others by asking questions and sharing knowledge in an online forum. Participants should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read and collected by other users of these forums. Constant Contact is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. </p>

<h2>Refer a Friend</h2>

<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our web site and our products, we will ask you for your friend's email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the web site.  Constant Contact retains this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>Some of our sites provide links to third-party websites, such as those of our business partners and online advertising partners. While on these sites, Constant Contact or its partners may collect information about you. Because Constant Contact does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy in any material way, we will post those changes on the Constant Contact Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>

<p>This policy is in effect as of October 2010.</p>
