<p>               A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to a user's computer,                which may then be stored on its hard drive.

Cookies cannot be used to steal personal information or to gain                access to information that you did not directly provide. The cookies                we use are set when you log on to The rSmart Group applications                and are erased when you log off The rSmart Group applications or                completely close your browser. </p>
