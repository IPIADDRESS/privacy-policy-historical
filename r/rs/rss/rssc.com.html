        Regent Seven Seas Cruises believes in protecting your privacy. These are our ten
        principles to you:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Notice.</strong> Where we ask for your personal information, we will
        tell you why we need your information, what we will do with it, and what options
        are available to you.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Relevance.</strong> We will require you to provide only those pieces
        of information that we need to perform the particular service you seek from us.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Retention.</strong> We will retain your information only so long as it
        is needed for business purposes, or as required by law.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. Choice.</strong> When we contact you for marketing purposes, we will
        let you know how to remove your name from future marketing efforts.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>5. Access.</strong> We will provide easy ways for you to access the information
        we have collected about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>6. Accuracy.</strong> We will promptly correct inaccuracies in your personal
        information that we discover or you bring to our attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7. Security.</strong> We will follow generally accepted industry standards
        to protect your personal information during transmission and storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>8. Sharing.</strong> When we share your information with other companies
        to help us provide our services to you, we will require them to comply with all
        applicable legal requirements regarding the privacy of your information. We will
        obtain your permission before sending your information outside of Regent Seven Seas
        Cruises for purposes not related to the services we provide you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>9. International Transfer.</strong> If we send your information to one of
        our facilities in another country, we will protect it with the same high level of
        security.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>10. Enforcement.</strong> We will regularly review how we are meeting these
        privacy principles and provide you a means to settle complaints about our privacy
        practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        To request access to your information, ask questions about our privacy practices,
        change your marketing preferences, or issue a complaint, contact us at:</p>

        <strong>Frequently Asked Questions -- Data Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Regent Seven Seas Cruises, with headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, is owned by Prestige
        Cruise Holdings, a subsidiary of Apollo Management L.P. Prestige Cruise Holdings
        is the market leader in the Upper Premium and Luxury segments of the cruise industry
        with more than 4,450 berths between the Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises brands,
        a number the company expects will grow to more than 6,700 berths by 2011.</p>
    <p>
        The content of this site is beneficially owned by Prestige Cruise Holdings, Inc.,
        the parent company of Regent Seven Seas Cruises and is the owner and operator of
        such brands that include Oceania Cruises, Inc., among others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How can someone learn about our privacy practices?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Wherever we ask for your personal information, we will let you know how you can
        find out about the steps we take to guard your information. If we are asking you
        for information online, such as on one of our websites, we will provide a link to
        our privacy policy. If you are making a reservation by phone, our operators will
        be able to answer your privacy questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What personal information do we collect, how, and why?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our sole purpose in collecting your personal information is to provide the level
        of hospitality you expect. By learning more about you and your preferences, we can
        provide you meaningful offers and deliver services that meet your highest standards.</p>
    <p>
        We will require the minimum amount of information from you that we need to provide
        our services. We will indicate the minimum required information on forms that we
        ask you to complete. Here are examples of instances when we may collect personal
        information:</p>
    <p>
        </p><ul>
            <li>If you're creating an online account at RSSC.com, we will require your e-mail address
                and a password. You have the option of including demographic information about your
                cruise preferences. If you do, we will use that information to provide specific
                information to you about cruises that match your geographic preference. </li>
            <li>If you sign up to receive the Seven Seas Explorer e-newsletter, we will ask for
                your name and e-mail address. </li>
            <li>If you use the "Find a Travel Agent" feature on RSSC.com, we will ask for a zip
                code to help us narrow your search. If you also provide your email address or telephone
                number, a travel agent may follow-up with you. </li>
            <li>If you request a cruise reservation on RSSC.com, we will ask for your name, address,
                phone number, and e-mail address to facilitate your reservation with one of our
                customer service representatives. </li>
            <li>If you order cruise brochures on RSSC.com, we will require your name, address, and
                e-mail in order to successfully process your order. </li>
            <li>Once you reserve your cruise with us, we will ask you to complete a government-required
            Guest Information Form that will include your name, address, phone number, date
            of birth, gender, passport number, and any special health considerations. </li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        <strong>When you cruise with us, you will need to bring your passport.</strong></p>
    <p>
        We believe that in order to make your stay with us pleasing and comfortable, we
        must strive to anticipate your needs. To do this, we will occasionally ask for your
        hospitality and cruising preferences. If you provide us comments through our guest
        cards, we will use your information to improve our services. We try to identify
        passengers who cruise with us a number of times to let them know about special offers
        they may be eligible for. To learn more about the needs and wishes of cruise customers
        and to accurately administer their records, we occasionally obtain customer information
        from companies outside our family of businesses, but will do so only if these companies
        have permission to share that information with us.</p>
    <p>
        If you are visiting one of our websites, we track the IP address of the computer
        you're using and the places on our websites you visit. This information does not
        contain any personally identifiable information. We track this information without
        your name and use it to improve the visitor experience on our websites. Web beacons/clear
        gifs are used primarily as tracking mechanisms throughout the site. They allow us
        to monitor user clickstream activity on our site in order for us to make changes
        that will allow for the site visitors to more easily accomplish their tasks on our
        site.</p>
    <p>
        If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site or our
        cruises, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically
        send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not
        store this information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do we use cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Like many commercial websites, we use "cookies". Cookies are small files placed
        on your computer that contain information you've provided to the website. For example,
        when you ask one of our websites to log you in automatically each time you visit
        the site, we'll place a cookie on your computer to enable that to happen. We may
        also use temporary cookies that expire after 30 days to track referrals to our websites.
        We utilize a third party to help us analyze the traffic that goes to this site.
        The third party does not gain access to any personal identifiable information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do we collect information from children?</strong></p>
    <p>
        No. We do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from children.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How long do we keep your information?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We will keep information associated with your name for only as long as we need it
        or as required or permitted by law. We have a corporate records management program
        that drives all our retention initiative.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do we use your information for marketing?</strong></p>
    <p>
        If you have given us your postal or email address, we may send you marketing information.
        At that time, we will also let you know how to remove your name from our marketing
        efforts. We will honor your marketing preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How can you remove your name from our lists?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Contact <a href="mailto:information@rssc.com">information@rssc.com</a> or 1-800-477-7500
        to request that you not be contacted for marketing purposes. Our e-mailed offers
        also include instructions for unsubscribing from future e-mailed offers. If you
        want to be removed only from our postal mailing list, please provide us with your
        complete name and address.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How can you access the information we've collected about you?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Contact <a href="mailto:privacy@rssc.com">privacy@rssc.com</a> or 1-800-477-7500
        and request that a copy of your personal profile be delivered to your home or e-mail
        address. We'll use secure means to confirm your identity to prevent the wrong people
        from accessing your information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How can you make corrections to your personal information?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Contact <a href="mailto:privacy@rssc.com">privacy@rssc.com</a> or 1-800-477-7500
        and request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal information, such as your
        name and address, or ask that we delete or remove your personal information from
        our records. Note that our ability to permanently delete your personal information
        may be limited by laws that require retention of certain types of data for a minimum
        amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also try to ensure that our customer addresses remain current by checking them
        against the national change-of-address lists that postal services make available.
        To deactivate your online account with us, contact us at the information above.
        We'll respond to your request within 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do we share your information with other companies?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We will not sell your information. We will also not share your information with
        businesses outside Prestige Cruise Holdings brands for purposes unrelated to providing
        the services you have sought from us, unless you have first given us your permission.</p>
    <p>
        One level of sharing occurs when we contract with other companies to help provide
        our cruise services. For example, when you reserve a cruise through an affiliated
        travel agent, that travel agent - who is not an employee of Regent Seven Seas Cruises
        - will need to share your booking information with us in order to reserve your voyage.
        We contract with other companies to provide services on our ship and at ports of
        call. For example, if you pay for a cruise using a credit card, we will authorize
        that payment through a third party. An outside telephone company also provides the
        telephone network we use to transmit information between our buildings and systems.
        We will use other companies to prepare and send surface mail and e-mail to customers.
        Whenever we contract with outside companies, we will hold them accountable to protect
        your information with generally accepted industry standards. When we provide a partner
        travel agent with your personal information to fulfill your request, the travel
        agent may also use your personal information to contact you regarding his/her own
        travel specials.</p>
    <p>
        Another level of sharing occurs with government agencies. Because our ships sail
        internationally, we are routinely required by the governments of our ports of call
        to provide information to them about our passengers. In other cases, we may be required
        by law enforcement or other government authorities to provide personally identifiable
        information to them for other law-enforcement purposes such as responding to a subpoena.
        In these instances, we will comply with our obligations and seek to do so in a way
        that protects your information.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do our websites send your information to other companies?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Our websites do not use technologies called "spyware" that secretly collect and
        transmit information about you outside the domain of the website.</p>
    <p>
        Be aware, however, that whenever you click on any advertisements on the Internet,
        the companies placing the ads may collect information about you through the use
        of cookies. Because of the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control
        this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers or content
        providers if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.</p>
    <p>
        Regent Seven Seas Cruises does contract with other companies to supplement the services
        we offer on our websites. In these instances, your information may be routed through
        these companies. Whenever we contract with outside companies, we will hold them
        accountable to protect our information with generally accepted industry standards.</p>
    <p>
        Please see the Terms and Conditions of RSSC.com for additional information about
        how site operates.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Do we transmit your information outside your country of residence?</strong></p>
    <p>
        As a global company, our operations cross national boundaries by necessity. We maintain
        our central data operations in North America. If you reserve your cruise through
        an agent in Europe, for example, your transaction will be processed by our computers
        in the U.S. If you call from the U.S. to make a reservation, your call may be taken
        by an operator in the U.K. In these cases, we will ensure that all of our locations
        are protecting your information to the same high level of security.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What security controls do we use to protect your information?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We use a combination of basic and advanced technical and procedural controls to
        prevent unauthorized people from seeing, altering, or obtaining your personal information.
        We operate secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewalls and intrusion-detection
        sensors. We frequently update our antivirus mechanisms and security patches. Our
        site uses SSL during the transmission of sensitive personal information such as
        credit card numbers and social security numbers.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do we enforce our privacy principles?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We undertake several initiatives to ensure our global operations are meeting our
        ten privacy principles, including providing awareness training to our staff. Our
        privacy and security policies and practices are regularly reviewed and enhanced.
        If you have questions or concerns about Regent Seven Seas privacy practices, contact
        RSSC at <a href="mailto:privacy@rssc.com">privacy@rssc.com</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do we make notification of changes to our privacy policy?</strong></p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions
        of this Policy at any time. Changes to this Policy may affect our use of personal
        information that you provided us prior to the effective date of the changes. If
        we make material changes to this Policy, we'll notify you by emailing you at the
