(including current versions of Microsoft Explorer and Netscape
Navigator) support SSL. The link between your browser and the

symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web
address beginning 'https://' (rather than http://).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Distance selling regulations</strong><br>

working days, starting the day after they receive the goods or

hard drive by the server of a web page you visit. It is an
individual label, which identifies you as a visitor - it cannot

the software we used to create parts of the site. Others are simply
