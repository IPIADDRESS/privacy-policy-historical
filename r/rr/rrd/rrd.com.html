<strong>Safe Harbor (European Union and Switzerland)</strong><br>
RR Donnelley recognizes that the EU has an "omnibus" information protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the "Directive") and that Switzerland has enacted the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection ("FADP"). Among other things, the Directive and FADP generally restricts the export of personal information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States, unless the US recipient can give "adequate protection" to such personal information when it is received or processed in the United States. RR Donnelley has signed up to Safe Harbor and has certified that it offers such "adequate protection".<br><br>

From time to time RR Donnelley affiliates pass to RR Donnelley in the United States certain individually identifiable information about individual contacts for RR Donnelley's customers in the EU and Switzerland ("EU and Swiss Business Contact Information"), individuals in the EU or Switzerland who are customers or employees of RR Donnelley's customers ("EU and Swiss Customer Information") and about individuals in the EU who are RR Donnelley’s or its affiliates' employees ("EU and Swiss Employee Information").

With respect to any sharing of EU and Swiss Business Contact Information for purposes of marketing RR Donnelley products and services, RR Donnelley obtains promises from its affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that such entities will use and disclose such EU and Swiss Business Contact Information for purposes of marketing RR Donnelley products and services only.
