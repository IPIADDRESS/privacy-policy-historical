   				<h1>Internet Privacy Policy</h1>
				
  <p>The privacy of our customers has always been important to the Railroad 
  Retirement Board.&nbsp; Our concern for your privacy is no different in the 
  electronic age.&nbsp; As a Federal Agency, the Privacy Act (U.S.C. 552a) 
  requires us to protect the information we collect from you.</p>


  <p><strong>The privacy policy outlined below applies only to the data we collect from 
  you over the Internet.</strong></p>


  <p>This is our notice to you about why we collect your personal information, 
  how we use it, and who we share it with; what your choices are for how
  we use your information; how we get access to your information; and 
  how we protect the information we collect and maintain.</p>

<p></p><h2><a name="why"></a>Why We Collect Your Personal Information</h2><p></p>

  <ul>
  <li>We collect personal data to administer the Railroad Retirement Act 
  and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. We do not use the information 
  for any other internal secondary purpose.</li> 
  <li>You don't have to give us personal information to visit our website.</li> 
  <li>If you do give us your personal information, we treat it very carefully.</li> 
  <li>We collect personal information about You (e.g., name, e-mail address, 
  Social Security number or other unique identifier) only if you specifically 
  and knowingly give it to us. You should note, however, that when you 
  send us an email, you automatically furnish us with your e-mail address 
  even if you don't furnish any additional personal information.</li>
  </ul>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

  <p></p><h2><a name="how"></a>How We Will Use Your Personal Information</h2><p></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We do not sell the information we collect at this site, or any information 
  we collect.</li> 
  <li>The personal information you give us at this site will be used only 
  in connection with the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act 
  and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. If you use our web site 
  to apply for benefits, the information that you give us on the application 
  will be used in the same way as if you had furnished the information 
  in person to our field office representatives or had completed an application
  and mailed it in to us. In both cases the uses of the information is 
  subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act. The retention period 
  will be the same. If, however, you send us an email, for example as 
  to how we can improve our web site, we will use the information you 
  provide for that purpose only. The identifying information you give
  us, such as your email address and your name, will not be retained 
  in a Privacy Act system of records, where we can retrieve your suggestion 
  by your name or email address.</li> 
  <li>For statistical purposes, we also collect non-personal information 
  about you. Sometimes we analyze this data to determine customer interest 
  in different parts of our website. The information we share is in a 
  format that does not personally identify anyone.</li>
  </ul>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

  <p></p><h2><a name="who"></a>Who We Will Share Your Personal Information With</h2><p></p>
  
  <p>We may disclose information you give us (e.g., to the Social Security 
  Administration, Department of Veteran's Affairs) if authorized or required 
  by Federal Law, such as the Privacy Act, Railroad Retirement Act, or 
  the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.</p> 
  
  
<p></p><h2><a name="your"></a>Your Choice About Who We Share Your Personal Information With</h2><p></p>

<p>If Federal laws (e.g., Privacy Act, Railroad Retirement Act, or the 
Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act) does not allow us to share information, 
we must get your written authorization before we can furnish your information 
to anyone else. </p> 

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

<p></p><h2><a name="youraccess"></a>Your Access to the Information We Collect About You</h2><p></p> 

<p>You may have access to any of the information we collect about you at this site. 
We'll correct any errors you may find. If you need to get or correct information 
about you, see  <a href="../bis/privacy_act/obtain_records.asp">
How to Obtain Records about Yourself</a>.</p> 

<p></p><h2><a name="howwe"></a>How We Protect the Security of the Information We Collect</h2><p></p> 

  <ul>
    <li>The Internet was originally designed as an open system with no built in security; however, we are required to protect the information we collect and maintain about you and will not use the Internet to do 	business with you unless we can do so in a secure manner. We will take	reasonable precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality and integrity of the information we collect at this site.</li> 
<li>The RRB sometimes uses contractors to perform various website and
database functions. When we do, we make sure that the agreement language with the contractor ensures the security, confidentiality and integrity of any personal information the contractor may have access to in the course of contract performance.</li>
  </ul>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

  <p></p><h2><a name="ourconcern"></a>Our Concern about Personal Information Via Email</h2><p></p>
  
  <ul>
<li>Electronic mail is not secure. Therefore, we suggest that you don't
send personal information to us via email. For our part we will send you only general information via email.</li> 
<li>Electronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) are covered under 	the same disposition schedule as all other Federal records. This means 	that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying 	periods of time if those emails meet the definition of Federal records.
Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed. </li> 
  </ul>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

  <p></p><h2><a name="ouruse"></a>Our Use of "Cookies" and How It Affects Your Visit to Our Website</h2><p></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent
to your computer along with a web page when you visit a website. Your
computer will give the information in the cookie only to the computer
that sent it, and no other website can request it. There are three types of 
cookies - persistent, third party, and session. We never use
persistent or third party cookies, but sometimes we use session cookies. </li> 
<li>We use session cookies only in some places where you can transact
business. We store the cookie on your computer only during your visit.
The session cookie keeps you from losing information you've entered
for a business transaction with us if, during your visit, you leave
our website and return. </li> 
<li>Once you turn off your computer or stop using the Internet, the cookie is erased. </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="backtotop" href="#top">[Back to top]</a></p>

  electronic mail (email) or by Really Simple Syndication (RSS) newsfeed. You 
  must explicitly provide your email address in order to subscribe (Opt-in) for 
  these updates. We use two different third party applications (FeedBlitz and 
  FeedBurner) to assist us in providing this service to you. Both of these 
  applications require your email address and may collect non-identifying 
  statistical information from you. We may analyze and use this information to 
  help us provide better service to you. In no case is personal information 
  collected or stored about you.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>FeedBlitz is the application we use when you want to subscribe for 
    automatic email updates on RRB benefits. The complete FeedBlitz Privacy 
    Policy can be found <a href="http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Privacy"> here</a>.</li>
    <li>FeedBurner is the application we use when you want to subscribe to RSS 
    newsfeeds provided by the RRB. FeedBurner is an application provided by 
    Google and you can find it's Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html">here</a>. </li>
