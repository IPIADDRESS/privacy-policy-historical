<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="lead-in">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Rafflecopter we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Rafflecopter collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Rafflecopter’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Rafflecopter’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Rafflecopter may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Rafflecopter also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Rafflecopter blogs. Rafflecopter only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Rafflecopter’s websites choose to interact with Rafflecopter in ways that require Rafflecopter to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Rafflecopter gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a href="http://www.Rafflecopter/">Rafflecopter</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Rafflecopter – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Rafflecopter collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Rafflecopter. Rafflecopter does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Rafflecopter may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Rafflecopter may monitor the most popular blogs on the Rafflecopter site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Rafflecopter may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Rafflecopter does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Rafflecopter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Rafflecopter’s behalf or to provide services available at Rafflecopter’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Rafflecopter’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Rafflecopter will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Rafflecopter discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Rafflecopter believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Rafflecopter, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Rafflecopter website and have supplied your email address, Rafflecopter may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Rafflecopter and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Rafflecopter takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Rafflecopter uses cookies to help Rafflecopter identify and track visitors, their usage of Rafflecopter website, and their website access preferences. Rafflecopter visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Rafflecopter’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Rafflecopter’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Rafflecopter, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Rafflecopter goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Rafflecopter may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Rafflecopter and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Rafflecopter may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Rafflecopter’s sole discretion. Rafflecopter encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Rafflecopter account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<p>July 1, 2010: Revised paragraph about IP addresses to explain when they are collected and that commenter IPs are visible to blog administrators</p>
<p>October 29, 2009: Added Comments paragraph to explain Akismet comment storage policy</p>
<p>March 10, 2009: Added Ads paragraph to alert users that ads from third parties may use cookies</p>
