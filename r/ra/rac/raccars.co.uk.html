                                <h1>RAC Cars Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and the procedures we have put in place to safeguard your privacy. Please read it carefully.</p>

<h2>How we use the information</h2>

<p>For the same reason we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie. Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive each time you access a website. We may use cookies to facilitate your internet sessions, to maintain security and to improve our site. In particular, cookies enable us:</p>
<p>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>

<h2>How we protect your information</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. The open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.
