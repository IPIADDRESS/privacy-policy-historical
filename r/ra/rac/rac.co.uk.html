<a name="yourinfo" id="yourinfo"></a><h4>Collecting your information</h4>
<p>From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in order to receive or use services on our website. These services include newsletters and competitions, live chats and message boards and personalised services such as "My RAC". We will also need personal information in order to supply other products and services or to help us identify you when you contact us. When we collect this information we will only do so over a secure connection. If you communicate with us by email over the internet you should be aware that the nature of the internet is such that unencrypted communication may not be secure and may pass through several different countries on route to us. Please do not email us with confidential or sensitive information such as your credit card details. We cannot accept responsibility for unauthorised access to your information that is outside our control. </p>
<p> We may combine this information with other information that we may hold about you if you are an RAC member, or have made enquiries of us before. We may also obtain information from publicly available sources suchas the electoral roll, or other third parties who have a legitimate basis on which to pass on your information. </p>
<p> We will act in accordance with current legislation and we will provide a link to our Data Protection Notice every time we invite you to submit personal information to us. Our Data Protection Notice is given below. </p>
<h4>RAC Data Protection Notice</h4>
<p> RACMS will share the information you provide, together with other information, with our group companies<span class="orangetext"><strong>*</strong></span>. We (the RAC and Aviva group companies) may use the information you provide for administration, marketing, customer services and profiling your purchasing preferences.

<p>For information about the way we use cookies and other web tracking devices please refer to <a href="/web/racworld/privacy_policy;jsessionid=E2511D702A4696DF7093F7B131A2BA86#collectinfo">section 2</a> in this privacy policy. </p>
<p> We may transfer your information outside of the European Economic Area, for example to Asia. We will only do this where it is necessary for the conclusion, or performance of a contract between us, or that we enter into at your request, in your interest, or for administrative, or our own marketing purposes. </p>
<p>If you give us information about another person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide it to us and for us to be able to process their personal data (including sensitive personal data) and also that you have told them who we are and what we will use their data for, as set out in this notice.</p>
<p>You have the right to ask for a copy of your information (for which we will charge a small fee) and to correct any inaccuracies. </p>
<p>For our joint protection and training purposes, telephone calls may be recorded and/or monitored. </p>
<h4>Informing you about products and services</h4>
<p>
We offer motoring and travel related products such as breakdown services and vehicle inspections, sales and leasing. We also offer financial products such as Insurance, loans and credit cards.

You will be able to re-submit the information when you have the required permission. </p>
