RRD has implemented this Privacy Policy to govern the use of Personal Information that we collect through the Site, including Personal Information you send to us. This Privacy Policy does not govern Personal Information collected from any other source or in any other manner.  This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to: (i) the type of information that is collected, (ii) how the collected information is used and with whom it is shared; (iii) how we intend to protect the information; and (iv) how you can access such information and have it modified and/or removed.This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time.

However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information. Because the privacy policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by us of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we do not have to provide you with such lists.

Our content includes information about Rachael Ray and her various endeavors, products, recipes, photos, video and interactivity with our users and also provides links to other sites Rachael Ray may or may not be affiliated with. </p><p>RRD respects privacy rights, and is committed to safeguarding the personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) entrusted to us by our clients and visitors to our Site.  RRD has implemented this Privacy Policy to govern the use of Personal Information that we collect through the Site, including Personal Information you send to us. This Privacy Policy does not govern Personal Information collected from any other source or in any other manner.  This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to: (i) the type of information that is collected, (ii) how the collected information is used and with whom it is shared; (iii) how we intend to protect the information; and (iv) how you can access such information and have it modified and/or removed.</p><p>This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time.  We will post changes to the Site, and we reserve the right to make changes without prior individual notice. Such changes are effective upon posting. Please review this Privacy Policy often so that you will remain abreast of RRD’s current policies, including its policies concerning the gathering and use of information that may be collected on our Site. You are responsible for making sure you are aware of the provisions of RRD’s most current Privacy Policy.  You can tell when the Privacy Policy was last modified by checking the “updated” date. </p><p>The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in and made a part of our <a href="http://www.rachaelray.com/page/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> of Use of the Site, and explains how users’ information and data is collected and used.</p><p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong></p><p>Under California law, California residents who have provided personal information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of personal information that had been so disclosed. However, if a company adopts and discloses a privacy policy that provides the ability to opt-out of such disclosures to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, then the company is not required to maintain and provide such lists, and instead may provide you with information on how to exercise your right to prevent disclosure of your personal information. Because the privacy policy as disclosed on this Site provides you with an opportunity to opt-out of disclosures by us of your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, we do not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@rachaelray.com">this address</a><em>,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>Attn: California Privacy Rights Administrator Collection of Information</p><p><strong>Collection and Use of Information </strong></p><p><em><strong>Personal Information </strong></em></p><p>Personal Information is information that uniquely identifies you, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number.  At times, RRD may collect your Personal Information.
