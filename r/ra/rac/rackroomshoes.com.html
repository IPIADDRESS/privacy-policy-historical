    <br>
    <a name="10"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">10.</span> Rack Room Shoes is dedicated to  protecting the privacy of all of its customers, especially children under the  age of 13. Additionally, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act  ("COPPA") requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about  how we collect, use, and disclose personally identifiable information from  children under the age of 13.&nbsp; COPPA also  requires that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for  children under the age of 13 to provide certain information to us. </p>
  	
    <p>Following is an explanation of our  policies regarding collection of information from children under the age of 13.  The term “child” or “children” below refers to such children under the age of  13 and the term “parent” below includes legal guardians.</p>
  	<p><strong>(a)</strong> <strong><u>Collection of Information</u></strong>.&nbsp; In connection with certain online sweepstakes  and promotions only, Rack Room Shoes may knowingly collect personally  identifiable information from children. In such event, the information  collected will be limited to the child’s name, age, address, e-mail address and  the e-mail address of his or her parent. Pursuant to applicable laws, Rack Room  Shoes will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the  child providing more personally identifiable information than is reasonably  necessary. All information will be collected by the active submission of such  information by the child, and not through the use of cookies or beacons.</p>
  	<p><strong>(b)</strong> <strong><u>Use of the Information and Disclosure to Third Parties </u></strong>.&nbsp; 
    If a child registers for a sweepstakes or  other promotion, we use the parent's e-mail address to notify the parent of the  child's 
    registration request (see below). All other personally identifiable  information collected from the child will be used for the express 
    purpose of  operating the sweepstakes or promotion only, which may include notification to  the child regarding rules and results of the 
    sweepstakes and/or e-mail messages  to the child regarding in-store or online promotions.&nbsp; In connection with such use only, we may  share 
    the child’s personally identifiable information with our website hosting  partners and certain third-party marketing services firms, as 
    necessary. These  parties have agreed to maintain the privacy and security of the personally  identifiable information.&nbsp; In addition, we  
    may share a child's personally identifiable information with third parties to  the extent reasonably necessary to: protect the security of 
    integrity of our  sites; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process;  or to the extent permitted under provisions 
    of law, to provide information to  law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.  Except for the limited 
    disclosures described in this paragraph, we will not  make any public disclosure (on our website or a chat page, for example) of any  
    personally identifiable information provided to us by a child.&nbsp; As provided in (2) above, we do not sell any  personally identifiable 
    information concerning our users.</p>  <p><strong>(c)&nbsp;<u>Parental Consent</u></strong>.&nbsp; If Rack Room Shoes has actual knowledge that  any 
    child under the age of 13 has attempted to provide any personally  identifiable information, we will send an e-mail to the parental e-mail 
    address  provided to us, and allow parents 48 hours to refuse a child’s submission (and  our subsequent collection and use for a stated purpose)
     of personally  identifiable information. If the parent refuses to allow the child’s submission  (and our subsequent collection and use for a 
     stated purpose), we will promptly  delete the child’s information from our database. If for any reason, the e-mail  sent to the parental 
     e-mail address is undeliverable, we will delete the  child’s submission as if the parent refused the child’s submission.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event a 
     child wins a sweepstakes or  contest, and we want to publicize the name (and/or other personally identifiable  information) of such child, 
     we will again notify the parent at the parent's  e-mail address and request that the parent provide his or her name and address  for delivery 
     of the applicable release and consent form. We will not publish or  release the name or other personally identifiable information of any child 
     as a  winner of any contest without the express written consent of the child’s  parent.</p>
     
  	<p><strong>(d) <u>Review and Deletion of Information</u></strong>.&nbsp; A parent can contact our customer service  department at the contact information provided in (7) above at any time to  review, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have  collected from his or her child.&nbsp; A  parent may also expressly request that a child’s information not be shared with  those limited third-parties with which we may share information, as necessary  (and except as may be required pursuant to applicable laws), pursuant to (b)  above.&nbsp; If you need any further  information, or have any questions regarding our collection of personally identifiable  information from children, please contact us at: Rack Room Shoes Marketing Department, 8310 Technology  Drive, Charlotte, NC 28262, or rackroomshoes@in10sity.net</p>
