<h3>4-2 Disclosure to Sellers of Goods and Services</h3>
                <p>We provide your personal information to sellers and relevant service providers (each a “Merchant”), including those located outside of Japan, when you use the Services to purchase products, or to request transaction related services such as a booking confirmation or a product delivery (including offers to make transactions). In such cases, we only disclose your information to the extent necessary to effect the transaction. </p>
                <p>Personal information provided for the purpose of effecting transactions between you and Merchants is managed by the Merchants. In addition to completing the transaction you have requested, Merchants may use your personal information for the purposes of providing you with information via email newsletters after the transaction, analyzing your purchases and use of their services, or for the improvement of their own business operations.</p>
                <p>Please exercise caution when disclosing any information to the Merchants as any information which you disclose directly to the Merchants will not be governed by this Policy. Any such disclosure will be subject to the privacy notices that they provide.</p>
<h3>4-3 Disclosure to Other Third Parties</h3>
                <p>In addition to the disclosures described above, we may also disclose your personal information to certain trusted third party service providers, including those located outside of Japan, where necessary to carry out our business operations.</p>
                <p>Please be assured that we will only disclose your personal information in compliance with applicable law, and with the appropriate management and supervision of the relevant third parties.</p>
                <p>On occasion, judicial or regulatory authorities may request access to or disclosure of information about you for law enforcement purposes. Such requests typically pertain to criminal investigations or other legal proceedings. Where they are necessary and legitimate, we will respond to such requests in accordance with our internal policies and applicable law.</p>
                <p>Additionally, in cases where it is necessary to prevent and mitigate fraudulent or illegal activities (3-6), or to protect life, body, or property, we may disclose your personal information to another Rakuten Group company or to a third party.</p>
                <p>We will not use or disclose your information for purposes not set forth in this Policy without informing you and taking any necessary steps in advance as required under applicable law. Regardless of the purpose, we will not sell or rent information about you to a third party without your express consent. </p>

                <p>If you do share your Rakuten password with a third party for any reason, including when the third party has promised to provide you additional services such as account aggregation, the third party will have access to your Account and your personal information. In such cases, to the extent that the liability is not attributable to us, we are not liable for any losses or damages that you may incur as a result of activities that take place on your Account.
