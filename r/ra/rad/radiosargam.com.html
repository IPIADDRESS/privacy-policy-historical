				<p>Radiosargam.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>

We use aggregated (gathered up data across all user accounts) information to develop content targeted to usersâ interests and to better the Web site user experience.

Googleâs use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.<br>
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. </p>
<p>What this Privacy Policy Covers</p>
<p>This privacy policy covers the Web site Radiosargam.com.</p>
<p>Please be aware that Radiosargam.com sponsors, advertisers, co-branded Web site or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you on their Web sites. The information practices of those parties are not covered by this privacy statement. Radiosargam.com users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.</p>
<p>Gathering of Information</p>
<p>Voluntary Submission<br>
Radiosargam.com does not collect personally identifying information about any individual Radiosargam.com Web site user except when knowingly provided by such individual. For example, we may ask you for information, such as your e-mail address, zip code and the country in which you are viewing the Web site when you register to become a member of Radiosargam.com or other personalization applications, to enter a contest or complete a survey or to receive a newsletter.  You always have the option not to provide the information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Radiosargam.com Web site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.</p>
<p>Cookies<br>
A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your computerâs hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. Radiosargam.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns throughout the Radiosargam.com Web site and to remember your passwords so that you donât have to reset them each time you visit the Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user. Business partners of Radiosargam.com and vendors providing hosting and other services for Radiosargam.com., as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies which may collect similar anonymous information.</p>
<p>Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation toÂ·not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Browser Level Information</p>
<p>Radiosargam.com Web servers automatically collect information about a site userâs IP address, browser type and the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Web site or not) and which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the Web site or not) by reading this information from the userâs browser (information provided by every userâs browser). This information is collected in a database and usedâin an aggregated, anonymous mannerâin our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is automatically logged by most Web sites.</p>
<p>Use of Information</p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site.</p>
<p>To Target Content<br>
To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but instead how well each page or content area performs overall.</p>
<p>To Provide Interactive Communications From Radiosargam.com<br>
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications, such as our electronic newsletters, to the e-mail address that you provide to us. Such interactive communications are provided only to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive them as part of their user profile.</p>
<p>From time to time we may provide e-mails highlighting new features, promotions or contests on the Web site to those users who have expressly provided us with their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile.</p>
<p>To Provide Communications From Third Parties<br>
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. However, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers as part of their user profile. In those cases, your personal information is not transferred to the third party.</p>
<p>Control of Your Information<br>
Users may change their user profile to stop receiving newsletters or marketing material from Radiosargam.com or on behalf of external third party business partners.</p>
<p>Sharing of Information<br>
When you are on an area of Radiosargam.com and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Radiosargam.com as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Radiosargam.com. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service. In addition, any personally identifiable information provided by our users as part of an advertiser promotion online may be provided directly to advertisers.</p>
<p>Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers<br>
Radiosargam.com derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users. In order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally identifying information about our users to these parties.</p>
<p>As Necessary to Provide Services to You<br>
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf.  We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. In some instances, one of these companies may collect information directly from you (such as for credit card processing). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider. In all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>As Required By Law<br>
Radiosargam.com may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Radiosargam.com or to protect and defend the rights or property of Radiosargam.com.</p>
<p>Security<br>
Your information is stored on Radiosargam.comâs servers. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, âfirewallsâ and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, âperfect securityâ does not exist on the Internet.</p>
<p>Privacy of Children<br>
Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to usâincluding information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>How to Contact Us<br>
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to contact us by e-mail at radiosargam@hotmail.com. We read every message submitted and try to reply promptly to every one.</p>
<p>How Will I Know if the Privacy Policy Is Changed?<br>
This statement may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. [If we are going to be using the information collected from users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.]</p>
