            <p class="text"><strong>POLICY FOR USERS</strong><br>
              Radar Online may collect personal information from users in order 
              to provide them with a personalized online experience and to provide 
              our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. Radar may share 
              the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates 
              and other sites operated by and for Radar. On a confidential basis, 
              Radar may also share personal information with our corporate affiliates 
              or consultants or with third parties that perform a particular service 
              on our behalf (such as fulfilling orders or for general site administration 
              purposes). Radar shares aggregate information with third parties 
              for advertising and promotional purposes. Radar may also disclose 
              personal information in response to legal process, such as a request 
              by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the 
              integrity of our site if we believe that a guest has committed unlawful 
              or otherwise harmful acts. </p>
            <p class="text">With the permission of users, information submitted 
              at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing 
              and promotional purposes by us and, also with the permission of 
              the user, may be shared by us with companies that have agreed with 
              Radar to use this information only for the marketing and promotion 
              of its products and services. </p>
            <p class="text">If guests elect to use our "E-mail to a Friend" referral 
              service for informing a friend about our site, we ask for the friend's 
              e-mail address, and we will send an e-mail in response to your request 
              inviting them to visit the site. This information is stored at Radar 
              Online solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</strong><br>
              An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically 
              assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever 
              you log on to the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer 
              by its IP address, so when a guest requests pages from our site, 
              our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses of our 
              guests are collected only for the purposes of system administration 
              and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our corporate 
              affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a 
              particular service on our behalf. We do not combine IP addresses 
              with any personally identifying information, nor do we compile any 
              session activity reports by IP address.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong><br>
              In cyberspace, cookies are pieces of information that a Web site 
              transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.</p>
            <p class="text">Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving 
              your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at a site. 
              The use of cookies is an industry standard; you'll find them at 
              most major Web sites. </p>
            <p class="text">By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies 
              help us see which areas are popular and which are not and help in 
              targeting ads based on guest interests. Many improvements and updates 
              to the site are based on such data as total number of guests and 
              pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">A cookie allows us to store the personal preferences 
              that you set during each visit to our site, which in turn allows 
              us to speed up your future activities at our site. Similarly, the 
              stores hosted by our site usually use cookies to track which products 
              you've chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the 
              record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over 
              and over again. During future visits to our site, we will only read 
              and retrieve information that we set in a cookie during an earlier 
              visit to our site. </p>
            <p class="text">The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party 
              servers is also standard in the Internet industry. Accordingly, 
              you may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Radar Online 
              does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to the 
              Radar Online Privacy Policy. By the same token, our advertisers 
              do not have access to Radar Online's cookies. </p>
            <p class="text">Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. 
              You can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies 
              are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site 
              function properly if you do so. Specifically, you will not be able 
              to purchase products or services through this site unless you accept
