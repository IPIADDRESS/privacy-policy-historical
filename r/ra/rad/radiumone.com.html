    <p>We maintain the highest privacy standards in the industry. We do not collect any personally identifiable information. Any data generated by RadiumOne is for the sole use of the network and will not be sold or shared.</p>
    <p>RadiumOne takes the issue of user privacy on the Internet very seriously and the following is intended to be a plain English explanation of the approach we currently employ. We always welcome comments on our privacy policy and constantly strive to maintain a privacy policy which improves the service we provide to advertisers, publishers and Web users in general.</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>RadiumOne is an online advertising network. We work with hundreds of Web sites around the world buying display (image) advertising space and re-selling it in carefully targeted packages to advertisers and agencies. The targeting options we offer range from simple geographic locations to more complicated targeting involving user's interests. As we target, we identify the sites and groups of users that are most likely to create a response to an advertiser's campaign.</p>
    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><span class="TxtUnderline">Cookie and Pixel Information</span><br>
      Cookies and pixels provide us with the ability to create an ID in order for us to match collected data to an anonymous machine including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The URLs (or Web site address) of Web pages which have been viewed</li>
      <li>The date and time of visit to a Web page</li>
      <li>Whether the user has clicked on an ad of one of our Advertisers, visited their Web site, or undertaken a transaction with them </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="TxtUnderline">Session Information</span><br>
      This information relates to user, campaign and interest-based history and is used for frequency capping and interest targeting. This information is gathered from Web sites visited and clicks registered by the user's machine.</p>
    <p><span class="TxtUnderline">Request-based Information</span><br>
      This information is passed to us by the user's computer browser with every request and is stored entirely anonymously for statistical purposes only:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses - Every device connected to the Internet has an IP address. This cannot be traced to an individual user but can be used for geographic targeting and statistical measurements.</li>
      <li>Browser type - e.g. Are you using Microsoft Explorer or Apple's Safari?</li>
      <li>Computer Operating System - e.g. Are you using Windows Vista or Apple OS?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may purchase anonymous data from third party sources. This data is anonymous and is used to update existing user profiles. We do not share, rent or sell any of the data acquired from third party sources.</p>
    <h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information. The IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau), which is a trade association for the Internet marketing industry, defines personally identifiable information as "information that can be traced back to a specific user and provide personal information such as name, address, phone number, etc." In other words, it's information about you that can identify you as a person rather than an anonymous profile.</p>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive consumer information, such as insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or information about medical conditions.</p>
	<p>All of our profiles are anonymous, and relate to a computer rather than a user. For us, they are nothing more than a number with which we associate interests and/or an estimated or inferred demographic profile.</p>
    <h2>Cookies and Pixels</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored within a folder on your computer and are used only by your Internet browser. They are not programs or applications - they are merely a marker of our previous contact with you. They take up a tiny amount of space on your computer (less than a regular Webpage without images does) and can be used to uniquely, but anonymously, identify your computer.</p>
    <p>Most Web sites use cookies to identify users and improve the user experience.</p>
    <p>The RadiumOne cookie does not harm your computer in any way or provide us with any information about your identity. The RadiumOne cookie is not spyware or adware.</p>
    <p>The general definition of spyware/adware is that of a software package installed on your computer for purposes of monitoring all your Internet or general computer activity. We do not install software of any kind on your computer and have no ability to monitor or track your general computer or overall Internet usage. Cookies can be easily avoided by opting out from them, or adjusting your browser settings.</p>
    <p>Pixels are small text files used to track Web site visitation and actions taken by users on these Web sites. The information collected from the pixel is stored in the cookie.</p>
    <h2>How We Use This Data</h2>
    <p>RadiumOne uses the information collected to target advertising campaigns more effectively. The aim is for you to see ads which you are more likely to be interested in, rather than ads that you aren't. We do this by comparing the information relating to the machine's anonymous profile, against our selection of ad campaigns and choosing the most suitable advertisement. It's important to understand that RadiumOne can only create these profiles and display ads to you when you visit a Web site that we have a relationship with.</p>
    <p>Most Web sites you visit will not charge you, but are funded by the ads that you view. The more effective the advertising on a site, the more money it can generate from fewer ads - reducing the clutter and invasiveness of the advertising on their Web sites. Identifying anonymous profiles allows RadiumOne to offer an improved online experience for you, increased performance to our advertisers and enhanced revenues for our Web sites.</p>
    <p>We do not sell, rent or share any of the anonymous data to third parties.</p>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>RadiumOne maintains all server log data (see "What Data We Collect") and data stored in the cookie for a period of 12 months to comply with audits, court order or law enforcement inquiries. After 12 months all of the stored data is destroyed. Summarized data is kept indefinitely. Summarized data is aggregated statistical data (impressions and clicks) used for financial reporting purposes.</p>
    <h2>Action Attribution</h2>
    <p>To gain a greater understanding of a site's performance, or a user's general interests, we use a variety of technologies to determine which Web sites in our network the user visited previously and/or where the user clicked on an advertisement. Using this information, we can calculate which Web sites and/or which broad interest characteristic of user is likely to best respond to a particular campaign. This takes two forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance Attribution - We monitor the sales, signups or visits to certain predetermined pages on our advertisers' Web sites. We reconcile these page 'hits' back to the ads that were shown to allow us to manage advertising campaign delivery, and report on this to our advertisers and publishers. We use cookies to limit the number of ads any individual computer is exposed to.</li>
      <li>User Interest Profiling - To create a user interest profile, we observe which Web sites within our network users have interacted, and we determine what topics those Web sites are about. This information is combined to generate an anonymous interest profile for specific computers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on the content of the sites users visit, we build an anonymous profile which contains information on potential interests and a statistical estimate of their likely demographic. For example, if a user visits a sports site within our network then we may classify them as broadly interested in that sport. All data that we use is stored anonymously.</p>
    <h2 id="opting_out">Opting Out</h2>
    <p>If you prefer not to have online advertising tailored to a user interest profile, you may opt out at any time by one of the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt out of RadiumOne's user interest targeting cookie by clicking the button below. Please note that if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different computer, you will need to opt out again.</li>
      <li class="OtpBtn"><a href="http://rs.gwallet.com/r1/optout?optout&amp;r1" title="Opt Out"><img src="http://rs.gwallet.com/r1/optout?status&amp;r1" alt="Opt Out"></a></li>
      <li>Disable cookies in your browser (typically under Tools-Options-Privacy, but this varies between browser types and versions). Please note that cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just targeting advertising, so this may adversely impact your online experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It should also be noted that opting out does not mean you will not see advertisements online, but these advertisements will not be targeted based on your online user interest profile from us as an individual vendor.</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>If you provide us with your contact or business information in order to conduct business with us as an advertiser or publisher, RadiumOne uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RadiumOne and you do so at your own risk.</p>
    <p>RadiumOne takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store data.</p>
    <h2>Correspondence</h2>
    <p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your email address. This relates to this correspondence only - and is not part of our core online business.</p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>RadiumOne is very sensitive to the importance of children's privacy and employs a zero-tolerance approach to advertising to children. RadiumOne's Web sites, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children. RadiumOne does not employ or offer targeting towards children under the age of 18. If you believe your child has provided RadiumOne with personal information, or registered at one of RadiumOne's Web sites, and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us.</p>
    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy is subject to change without notice. If you visit our Web site or use our services, the terms and conditions of this privacy policy as displayed at that time apply.</p>
    <h2>Effective Date</h2>
    <p>The privacy policy was last revised on September 29th, 2010.</p>
