                functionality available through the Service. For example, we may inform our advertisers and other third

            <h2 class="text-left">Data retention</h2>
            <p>
                The storage and processing of the data of website’s visitors and users’ of services is done solely as
                permitted by law or under your explicit consent only for as long as required to meet the purposes of the
                processing (as defined above) or until you disagree with the use of your personal data by Radiojar or
                until you withdraw your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, the personal information of the visitors of the website will be retained and processed
                according to Section 4 (a) above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Registered users’ data will be retained and processed until the registered user requests the deletion of
                his account or, for any processing of his or her data, on the basis of his consent, until he declares
                his / her withdrawal of consent for the purposes of providing the Services. Nevertheless, some necessary
                personal data regarding the user’s contractual relations with Radiojar as well as regarding the
                information, consent and withdrawal of his consent to the processing of his data will remain as
                information for the registered user to ensure the proof of the legitimacy of the processing of his data
                by Radiojar and safeguarding the parties' legal claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, data submitted to Radiojar via feedback and customer support forms will be retained and
                processed until the provision of the particular service is completed and, as far as feedback is
                concerned, for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which feedback is requested (i.e. improve
                the Service, etc).

            <h2 class="text-left">Your rights in relation to your personal data</h2>
            <p>
                Upon request, you will be provided with information about whether and how personal data is collected and
                processed in relation to you ("access right").
                If your personal data is incorrect, you have the right:
            </p><ul>
                <li>
                    Ask for their correction to the extent that it is inaccurate and / or incomplete ('right of
                    rectification').
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for their deletion ("Deletion right"). Radiojar will delete your personal data without undue
                    delay under the terms and conditions of the applicable law. Radiojar can only delete the data if
                    there is no legal obligation or if it has no other legal right to maintain it. Certainly if the data
                    of a visitor / user of the site is deleted, then Radiojar is unable to continue providing its
                    services to that user when they require the use of that data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for the restriction of the processing of your personal data under the terms and conditions of
                    the applicable law and be informed before the restriction of processing is lifted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing to each
                    recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves
                    disproportionate effort, and to be informed of those recipients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, ie in
                    electronic form, as well as the right to transmit it to another controller ("portability rights").
                </li>
                <li>
                    At any time, oppose the processing of your personal data based on reasons related to your particular
                    situation ("right to object").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not make a decision that is based solely on an automated decision-making process, such as
                    profiling,
                    since the decision would have legal effects for you or other equally important implications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Revoke your consent to use your personal data in the future, in whole or in part. The withdrawal of
                    your consent does not affect the legitimacy of the processing based on consent prior to its
                    revocation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Finally, under the applicable personal data legislation, you have the right to file a complaint with the
                Personal Data Protection Authority.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we would be
                unable to provide you many of the features and functionality found on the Service. You may update,
                correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing the "my account"
                tab through the Service. If you wish to access or amend any other personal information we hold about

            <p>
                Please be aware that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active user databases, we may
                retain all information you submit for backup and archiving purposes in case it proves impossible or
                involves disproportionate effort to remove such information.
            </p>
            <p>
                To protect your privacy and security, we may ask you to verify your identity before granting you account
                access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
                your unique password and account information at all times.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Data Security:</h2>
            <p>
                For Radiojar, protecting the privacy of visitors and users of the site and respecting the privacy of the
                person on the internet is a self-evident commitment. All necessary organizational and technical measures
                are required to ensure the security, availability and validity of the personal data of visitors and
                users of the site and to protect them against accidental or unlawful destruction, disclosure and other
                forms of fraudulent processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensure that your personal information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure,
                appropriate physical, electronic and organizational procedures have been put in place to protect and
                safeguard personal data collected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and therefore provides maximum security against
                the interception of personal data. This protocol is the standard for the certification of websites for
                network users and for the encryption of data trafficked between web users and web servers. In addition,
                SSL ensures that it will be ascertained if the data being trafficked through it has been altered during
                transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in an effort to
                preserve the integrity and security of your personal information, we cannot, however, ensure or warrant
                the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In case of security
                breach, we become aware of, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
                protective steps and/or post a notice through the Service. We advise you to carefully check all the
                relevant communications you receive from us.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-left">Changes and Updates to this Policy:</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to update this Policy at any time without prior notice from time to time
                by posting a new version on the site. We will process the data in accordance with the Policy in force at
                the time you provided your consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with this
                Policy. When a material change occurs in the Policy, we will notify you accordingly, e.g. via a visible
                banner on the site, sending a message to your email address, or messaging you through the Service.
                Material changes to this Policy will be effective upon the earlier of (i) your first use of the Service
                with actual knowledge of such change, or (ii) 30 days from providing you notice of such change. We
                encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and
                disclose information. You should check this page occasionally to make sure you are satisfied with any
                changes to this Policy and carefully read any relevant notice you receive. By continuing using the site,
                you consent to the updated Policy. Use the "Last Updated" date in this Policy to learn about when it was
                last modified.
