        <h2 class="text-left">Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            Personal data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal Data Collection and Processing
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy (this 'Policy') describes what information we gather from you, how we use and disclose that information, and what we do to protect it. 
            The practices described in this Policy apply only to our use of information supplied by you to us through the Service. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">The Information We Collect:</h2>
        <p>
            <b>"Personal information"</b>, as used in this Policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal information also includes information about an individual's activities, such as information about his or her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked directly to personal information that identifies that individual.
            This section describes the personal information and other information we collect on the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you visit our website, our web server temporarily stores by default personal data for the purpose of system security, namely:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>the connection data of the inquiring computer (IP address)</li>
            <li>the pages you visit on our website, the date and duration of the visit</li>
            <li>the identification data of the employed browser and operating system type</li>
            <li>the website from which you accessed our website</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This data is also analysed for statistical purposes. Such statistical analyses do not contain any personal data. <b>Individual user tracking is not carried out</b>. Personal data beyond this, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, is not collected unless you provide this information voluntarily, e.g. for the purposes of using our service.
        </p>
        <p>
            User provided information: When you sign-up for the Service, we ask for:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>your first and last name, </li>
            <li>email address, and gender, </li>
            <li>we  ask you to create a password for your account. Optionally, you may choose to provide a photo and your telephone number.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Additionally, either during registration or at other times (such as when you elect to use facebook or other social messaging links available), if you permit us to connect to your Facebook profile, we may collect information from your Facebook profile such as your name, email, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture URL, list of friends. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, if you sign in to Twitter while using the Service, we collect all information, including personal information, that may be available to us through the Twitter API relating to your Twitter account, including, but not limited to, your Twitter account's photo, name, last mentions, your followers, and your followers who follow you back.
            We may also provide you with other opportunities to voluntarily provide personal information to us on the Service, such as through feedback or customer support forms, user profile functionality, or other means.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">The Ways we Use Information:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                We may use "automatically collected" information to: (a) personalize the Service, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (b) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service and marketing activities on the Service (including by third parties); (c) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of users (d) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities that may be offered on the Service from time to time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-left">When We Disclose Information:</h2>
        <p>
            We are not in the business of selling your personal information. We do, however, disclose your personal information and other information about you in a variety of circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We may work with third-party service providers to provide maintenance services, data analysis, service hosting, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your personal information as part of providing their contracted services to us. We require these third-party service providers to agree to only use the personal information we provide them for the purpose for which it was provided.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may disclose your information, including personal information, if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity or other legal process.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also reserve the right to disclose your information, including personal information, as we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect Radiojar and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Service and our other property; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or other persons or entities.
            </li>
            <li>
                We make certain automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties, to: (i) comply with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users' interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service. For example, we may inform our advertisers and other third parties that a certain proportion of the Service's users are female and have used the service to transmit a specific kind of music or other radio transmissions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-left">Choices and Access:</h2>
        <p>
            You may, of course, decline to share certain personal information with us, in which case we would be unable to provide you many of the features and functionality found on the Service.
            You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing the "my account" tab through the Service. Additionally, you may request that we delete all information about you that we have received from Facebook by emailing us at support@radiojar.com .

        <p>
            Please be aware that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, analytics, and prevention of fraud and abuse.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cookies" class="text-left">Cookies we use</h2>
        <h3>What cookies are and how we use them, a list of all the cookies used on the Radiojar site and how to opt out of or block non-essential cookies.</h3>
        <p>
            We use several types of cookies for a range of reasons across the Radiojar website. Some are essential, while others you can opt out of or block.
        </p>
        <p>
            Opting out or blocking some cookies may affect the functionality of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the cookies we use are essential to the performance of the website, while others are not.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to be open in the way we use cookies, and to help you make informed choices about the information you provide to us and third parties when you visit our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to a device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-left">Why and how we use cookies</h3>
        <p>
            There are broadly four reasons why a cookie might be stored on your device when visiting the Radiojar website.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cookies that make the website work properly for you and enable you to make use of the secure online services that we provide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies that collect data about your use of the website which is then anonymised and used to help us improve our online services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies that remember your preferences and make the site easier for you to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies that are placed by third party services we make use of to enhance the information we present online. We have no control over these third party cookies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These cookies are placed on your device either by Radiojar or by the third parties whose services we use as part of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some cookies are retained in your browser for only as long as you visit our website, while others persist for a longer specified or unspecified period.
        </p>
        <h3>How to block cookies</h3>
        <p>
            You can restrict or block cookies which are set during your use of the website by changing your browser's settings. Some pages may not work if you completely disable cookies, but many third party cookies can be safely blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check information in your browser's help section for specific instructions on how to manage cookies. Alternatively, websites such as "All About Cookies" provide comprehensive guidance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">Guide to managing cookies</h2>
        <h3>Strictly necessary cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Some cookies we place on your browser ensure that Radiojar's website delivers you information and services securely and optimally.
            You must accept these essential cookies to be able to make use of our online systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Some cookies enable websites to remember choices their users make. These cookies are known as "functionality cookies" and help to improve a user's experience of a website by providing a more personalised service.
        </p>
        <h3>Performance cookies</h3>
        <p>
            We use a number of tools that monitor visitor behaviour on our website to help us improve our information and services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool we use most consistently is Google Analytics. Anonymous data about your visit is collected and amalgamated with that of other visitors so we can better understand how people use our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can opt out of providing us with this information if you wish, with no impact on your experience of our website.
        </p>
        <h3>Third party cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Some Radiojar website pages use third party services or software, such as maps, online videos or social networking features. Many of these services may set cookies on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can block or remove cookies yourself by altering the settings of your browser. Blocking these cookies is unlikely to impact on your experience of our website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left"> Data Security:</h2>
        <p>
            We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards in an effort to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of personal information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. Please be aware, however, that this is not a guarantee that such personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">Data Hosting </h2>
        <p>
            Radiojar always cooperates with reliable cloud hosting service providers. Radiojar cooperates with such cloud hosting providers who are either located within the E.U. (and therefore are obliged to comply with all EU Data Protection Laws and Regulations) or may be located in the US. In the latter case, US located cloud hosting providers are selected by Radiojar, on grounds of US providers being certified members of of the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor companies (<a target="_blank" href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx">https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx</a>). 
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">Changes and Updates to this Policy:</h2>
        <p>
            We may occasionally update this Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the Policy. Your continued use of the Service after a revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the then-current version of the Policy. If we change this Policy in a manner that is materially less restrictive of our use or disclosure of your personal information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the change and to obtain your consent prior to applying the change to any personal information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, message you through the Service, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Material changes to this Policy will be effective upon the earlier of (i) your first use of the Service with actual knowledge of such change, or (ii) 30 days from providing you notice of such change. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose information.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left">Radiojar Contact Information:</h2>
        <p>
