For example, we may collect personal information from you when you register on the Site, subscribe to one of our services, and at other times.

<p>We use your personal information and non-personal information for internal purposes, such as to provide you with the Site and services, to notify you of new products or services, and to otherwise communicate with you.</p>
<p>Sharing Information; Your Consent to Sharing</p>
<p>We may rent, sell, and share your personal information and non-personal information with our network partners and third-party affiliates for the purposes of direct mail, email marketing, mobile marketing, and telemarketing.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, data storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns.
