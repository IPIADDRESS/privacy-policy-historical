<p><strong>9. California Visitors</strong></p>
<p>Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which a CIMG Web Site has disclosed certain information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please <a href="mailto:privacy@cbsimg.com"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.&nbsp; For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the&nbsp;subject field of your&nbsp;email&nbsp;and include the name of the CIMG Web Site with respect to which you are requesting the information,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail,&nbsp;or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>
<p><strong>10. Privacy Protections for Children</strong></p>
<p>Most CIMG Web Sites are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about children under the age of 13. Some CIMG Web Sites may ask for a birth date to ensure that they are not collecting information from children under 13 or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under 18. In those instances where a CIMG Web Site has actual knowledge that it collects information from children, or offers a service directed toward children, it will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. To read about our privacy policy for children under the age of 13, please see the <a title="Children's Privacy Policy." href="#childprivacy"><strong>Children’s Privacy Policy.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>11. User-Generated Content</strong></p>
<p>Some CIMG Web Sites enable users to submit their own content for contests, blogs, videos, message boards, and other functions. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose your contact, financial, and other information in a submission. We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.</p>
<p><strong>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” and such changes will be effective upon posting. If we make any material changes in the way we use your information, we will notify you by sending an email message to the email address you most recently provided to us or by prominently posting a notice of the changes on CIMG Web Sites.</p>
<p><strong>13. Questions</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of data that are stored in separate files within your computer’s Internet browser. Cookies are accessed and recorded by the web sites you visit, and by the companies that show advertisements on web sites, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online.</p>
<p><strong>CIMG Web Sites use cookies for the following general purposes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting one of our Web Sites. For example, if you register on a CIMG Web Site, the Web Site may save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To help us customize the content and advertisements you are shown while visiting CIMG Web Sites and potentially other web sites online. Please read about <a title="our online advertising" href="#OnlineAd"><strong>our online advertising</strong></a> to learn more about our efforts to show you relevant advertising.</li>
<li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, advertisements, and other communications.</li>
</ul>
<p>CIMG Web Sites may also allow third parties to place their own cookies within your browser in order to serve you with relevant advertising online. Please note that we do not share contact information with these third parties and CIMG can only access cookies that we set on your browser, not the cookies sent to you by other companies. For more information about the use of cookies by third parties for advertising purposes, please read about <a title="third-party online advertising" href="#ThirdParty"><strong>third-party online advertising</strong></a> on CIMG Web Sites.</p>
<p>You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us or third parties to send you cookies, but if you block cookies, you may not be able to view or access some or all of&nbsp;a CIMG Web Site.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the CIMG Web Sites. Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</p>
<p>We use web beacons to improve your experience on our Web Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers. Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</p>
<p>CIMG Web Sites also may include third-party web beacons so that these third parties may receive auditing, research, and reporting information about advertisements viewed on the CIMG Web Sites. Third parties do not have access to your contact information in connection with their use of web beacons.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices</strong></p>
<p>Certain mobile devices contain unique identifiers that can be used, for example, to identify the physical location of such devices. Mobile devices also typically transmit caller ID data when used to transmit a telephone call or text message. CIMG Web Sites may collect, use, transmit, process, and maintain unique identifiers, caller ID data, location-based data, and similar information when you rely on mobile devices, including to provide the services you request, tell you about offers we think you will value, and improve your experience on CIMG Web Sites. CIMG Web Sites also may require collection of your mobile phone number in order for you to participate in certain services or features and that number may be associated with such information.</p>

<p>In order to customize your experience on the CIMG Web Sites, we may use <a title="cookies, web beacons, and other technologies" href="#Cookies"><strong>cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</strong></a> to collect information about the content and advertisements you view on our Web Sites.

<p>These online-advertising efforts across CIMG Web Sites do not result in you seeing more advertisements, just more relevant advertising, and they allow us to provide you with free content and services on our Web Sites.

<p><a name="childprivacy"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Children’s Privacy Policy </span></strong></p>
<p>We recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which this Children’s Privacy Policy is posted. The following guidelines supplement our general <a title="Privacy Policy" href="#PrivacyPolicy"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a> and follow the rules set by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other applicable laws. “Child” means an individual under 13 years of age or an individual under 18 where the collection, use or disclosure of personal information about such an individual is restricted by applicable law. When we use the term “parent” below, we mean to include legal guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>Children can enjoy content and features on CIMG Web Sites without directly providing contact information. However, children who wish to participate in sweepstakes, contests, and certain other special activities may need to provide information such as first name, user name, password, email address, date of birth, city and state of residence, and gender.</p>
<p>In the course of participating in interactive features such as chat rooms and message boards, a child may provide us with additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her postings. Some information, including information collected through <a title="cookies, web beacons, and other technologies" href="#Cookies"><strong>cookies, web beacons, and other technologies</strong></a>, may be collected automatically. For more information, see the “<a title="Information we collect automatically" href="#autocollect"><strong>information we collect automatically</strong></a>” section of our general Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If we collect, use, or disclose contact information collected from a child, we will provide notice and obtain parental consent in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>We do not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child’s providing more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>We use the information we collect consistent with the services requested by the child. For example, we may use information provided by the child to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Send a newsletter, electronic card, and other communication requested by the child;</li>
<li>Enable a child’s participation in certain interactive features such as games, contests, message boards, chat rooms, song requests, and online scrolling tickers; and</li>
<li>Respond to correspondence sent by the child.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may use a parent’s contact information to communicate with the parent regarding the child’s activities on CIMG Web Sites. For example, if a child wins a sweepstakes or contest, we may use the parent’s contact information to conduct prize fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
<p>Information collected from children will be disclosed in the same ways described in the “<a title="Disclosure of Information" href="#disclosure"><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></a>” section of our general Privacy Policy. Third parties who receive contact information collected by CIMG have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of that information. Parents have the option not to consent to the disclosure of their child’s contact information to third parties. Parents may consent to CIMG’s collection and use of their child’s contact information while refusing to permit the disclosure of that information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Parents’ Choices and Access to Children’s Information</strong></p>
<p>Parents may review the contact information we have collected from their child, refuse to permit us to collect further contact information from their child, and request that any contact information we have collected be deleted from our records. Parents may also correct factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p>To review, update, or delete your child’s contact information, please <a href="mailto:privacy@cbsimg.com"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.&nbsp; You may also&nbsp;send&nbsp;your request to&nbsp;the postal address listed below. To protect your child’s safety, we ask for proof of your identification. We may deny access if we believe there is a question about your identity.</p>
<p>Certain information cannot be deleted because of other legal obligations, such as <a title="FCC requirements" href="http://www.fcc.gov/"><strong>FCC requirements</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Children’s Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may amend our Children’s Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents with notice of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and share children’s contact information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their contact information to provide us with current email addresses. We will apply material changes in our Children’s Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>

<p><a name="FAQ"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">CIMG Privacy Policy FAQ </span></strong></p>
<p>We have updated our Privacy Policy to provide visitors of CIMG Web Sites with a single, uniform policy consistent with our core <a title="Privacy Principles" href="#Privacy Policy"><strong>Privacy Principles</strong></a>. Below, please find answers to some questions about our new Privacy Policy. To review the Privacy Policy, <a title="click here" href="#Privacy Policy"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Why are you updating your Privacy Policy?</span></strong></p>
<p>Our parent corporation, CBS Corporation and its subsidiaries recently joined together to offer their users access to a wider array of content and interactive experiences. We recognize the importance of providing the users of CIMG Web Sites a Privacy Policy that is consistent with those of other CIMG Web Sites and other web sites of business units of CBS Corporation and that is consistent with a set of core <a title="Privacy Principles" href="#Privacy Policy"><strong>Privacy Principles</strong></a> followed by those companies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Have you made any substantively material changes to the Privacy Policy?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we have not made any substantively material changes to our Privacy Policy. We have simplified the policy, made it uniform across CIMG Web Sites, and made it easier to follow.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is a key difference with the old Privacy Policy?</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the key differences is that our new Privacy Policy is provided in a layered format, allowing you to read highlights of our practices upfront with links to additional information about our privacy practices.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What are the “core” privacy principles that CIMG follows?</span></strong></p>
<p>Trust is a cornerstone of our mission at CIMG. We are committed to gaining and maintaining your trust by following five key principles: transparency, choice, access, security and accountability. For more information, <a title="click here" href="#Privacy Policy"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Will you share my contact information with third parties?</span></strong></p>
<p>Like other businesses, we share contact information (such as name and email address) with vendors who process credit card transactions, with business partners who co-sponsor our Web Sites, and when we have consent from our users. For more information, <a title="click here" href="#disclosure"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Can you give me an example when you will share my information with third parties?</span></strong></p>
<p>If you enter a sweepstakes that is jointly sponsored by a third party, we will share your contact information with that third party. Also, if you seek to download a free song from a band or listen to a free stream of a band, we might ask you to consent to have your contact information shared with third parties who may contact you about information concerning that band’s appearances. This allows us to offer you valuable content for free.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Does CIMG share contact information with other CIMG Web Sites or web sites owned by CBS Corporation?</span></strong></p>
<p>As CBS Corporations continues to expand its online offerings, we will share information with both CIMG Web Sites and other web sites owned by our parent, CBS Corporation, so we can better inform our users about products and services in which they may be interested. <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is up to you as to whether you want to hear about special offers from us or from other business units owned by CBS Corporation</span>. You can choose not to receive such marketing emails when you register with us, in any such email we send, or by <a href="mailto:privacy@cbsimg.com"><strong>contacting us</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Do you use my data for advertising on CIMG Web Sites?</span></strong></p>
<p>Like other web sites, we are able to offer free content and services through the revenue we receive from advertising on our Web Sites. We hope you value the advertising you see on our Web Sites, and we may use some data about you to tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. For example, if you visit a CIMG Web Site and view articles about computers, we may serve you with a computer-related advertisement when you visit another CIMG Web Site. This advertising does not result in you seeing more ads; rather, it just means the ads you would otherwise see are more relevant. To learn more, <a title="click here" href="#OnlineAd"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Does CIMG allow third parties to collect and use data about me for online advertising?</span></strong></p>
<p>Our advertisers may have relationships with third parties who deliver their advertisements on our Web Sites. As part of delivering these ads, the third parties may collect and use information about your activities on our Web Sites (such as the content you have viewed). These companies may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for advertising purposes. To learn more, <a title="click here" href="#OnlineAd"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">What are the benefits of the new Privacy Policy to me?</span></strong></p>
<p>We hope you will find our Privacy Policy easier to read and understand across all CIMG Web Sites. We are committed to gaining and maintaining your trust. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please <a href="mailto:privacy@cbsimg.com"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.</p>
