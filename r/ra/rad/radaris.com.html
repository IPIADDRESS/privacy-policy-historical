<h2>Radaris Privacy Policy</h2><div style="width:700px">Radaris has developed this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the privacy of the information that you provide when using Radaris’s application.

We encourage users to register on Radaris and take control of their online public profile.

This privacy policy explains the source of site information and how specific information is protected, collected and used by Radaris. This policy may be occasionally updated by Radaris: Radaris will, however, provide notice of significant changes to this privacy policy by posting a notice on the Radaris.com web site. 

With Radaris's account settings, you can set preferences about which information you wish to be visible to the world. Your settings allow you to either remove your information on Radaris completely from the public eye, or make it accessible to only a limited amount of people, such as your friends, your relatives, etc... Until you set your privacy settings, our default privacy settings will show only limited information, such as your name, town and state. This information will be visible to everyone who searches you by name. People within the same groups as you can also see that you belong to the same group as they do. Control of information obtained from publicly accessible external sources is beyond our control. Please contact these sources directly if you with them to remove certain information. We can tell you the source of that information upon request. Please send us your requests using online ticket system.
<p>
By submitting personal information to the Radaris web site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>1.  SITE INFORMATION SOURCE.</p>

Radaris purchases publicly available information from sources like telephone companies and other public directories.  If our information is outdated we encourage users to register and correct that data and to seek out the original sources for that error.  Upon request we can research and provide the public sources of the information we display.  


<p>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</p>

Radaris collects personal information such as name, email address, age and other information that is submitted knowingly and voluntarily through our web-site. We collect information during following instances-
a) During your registration at the Radaris web site, we will collect information that you provide us.
b) Whenever you save the personal information in your profile or in the profiles of the people you know, we will collect the information you enter.

<p>
Radaris collects other profile data, including, but not limited to: personal interests, gender, age, education, connections with other people or communities, and occupation, in order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.
</p>

Radaris also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

<p>3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE.</p>

Profile owner can set their own privacy settings about what information can be disclosed or shared with others, and in what manner. To facilitate the searching of people, users are allowed to search using first and last name, email address, contact information, schools, companies, and communities users may have been affiliated with. If profile owner does not specify privacy settings, the default settings will be used. The default settings allow searching for a person by name and address. However, once a person is found, his or her profile is not accessible to everyone. If a profile is linked to a certain group or community, other members of these groups will be able to see the affiliation to that group. Deleted information may still exist in back up copies, but will not be accessible to the public.
<p>
With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and sending account notifications, a member's email address is not shared or displayed to others, unless profile owner grants such permission.
</p>

Profile owner’s information, including user’s picture and name, are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in networking community. This is unless otherwise specified in your privacy settings.

<p>
We may also use a Profile owner's email address to send updates, account notifications, newsletters or news regarding the service. Profile owner may specify the types of emails that they wish to receive under their notification settings "Do not send me notification emails" in the user "Account Settings".
</p>

Radaris will penalize users who post incorrect, abusive, or false information about other users by revoking account privileges, upon learning of such actions.

<p>
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Radaris will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Radaris, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Radaris Terms of Service Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.
</p>

We do not provide your contact information to third parties marketing companies without your permission.

<p>4. STORING OF INFORMATION.</p>

Profile owner accounts are secured by profile owner created passwords. Radaris takes precautions to insure that all members’ account information is kept private.
