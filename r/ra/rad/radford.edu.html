      <p>It is the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia and Radford
      University that personal information about citizens will be collected
      to the extent necessary to provide the service or benefit desired
      and that only appropriate information will be collected.</p>

      <p>This website:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Does not require you to provide personal information in order
        to access public areas. Some dynamic web sites and forms require
        you to enter personal information or authenticate in order to
        access information on those pages.
        </li><li>The majority of web pages on this site do not require a "cookie"
        on your computer. Specific applications, such as the university's
        webmail system, library server, and the library proxy server,
        do place a "cookie" on your computer. No user information
        is gathered through "cookies" except for that needed
        to run the specific application.
        </li><li>Radford University maintains security standards and procedures
        regarding unauthorized access to customer information to prevent
        unauthorized removal or alteration of data.
        </li><li>If you have access to the Internet your computer automatically
        has an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a series of distinct numbers
        that identify your computer. We use customer IP addresses to
        track the number of customers who visit our site and identify
        our most popular pages so that we can improve the site content
        and diagnose problems with our server.
        </li><li>You have the right to review and update the record we maintain
        about you in order to verify its accuracy. For review of your
        information, contact the following offices: prospective students
        contact the Admissions Office; current students contact the Registrar;
        faculty and staff contact Human Resources; alumni or former students
        contact the Office of Alumni Affairs. Please see <a href="../RUContact.html">campus
        contacts</a> for phone numbers, email addresses and office locations.
        </li><li>Radford University does not share, sell, or trade database
        material such as email lists.<br>
