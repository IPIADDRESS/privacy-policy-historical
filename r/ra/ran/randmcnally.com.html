<p>
Shopping and obtaining information on-line has changed our lives. At Rand McNally,
your trust and satisfaction is of the utmost importance. Because we respect your
privacy, we have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information
is handled in a safe and responsible manner.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through Rand McNally's

it from time to time. This Policy was last revised on June 1, 2010.

<p>
Every time you visit our website, our Web server automatically collects the following
non-personally identifiable information: your Internet service provider's address,
the referring URL and information on the pages you access on our website.</p>
<p>
We also collect personally identifiable information that you provide, such as survey
information and information you provide when you make a purchase for a product or
service, register your e-mail address, register a product or software or sign-up
for sweepstakes or contests. If you register for our Rand McNally Classroom products
and services, we will also ask you to provide your school or organization's name,
school district, type of institution, enrollment and your position with that institution.
If you have visited our website before and provided us with your email address,
we collect information on what pages you access or visit while on our website.</p>
<p>
When you make a purchase on randmcnally.com, we ask you for your full name, billing
address, telephone number, email address, and credit card information. If you want
your order shipped to someone other than yourself, you will need to provide us the
name and address of the recipient.</p>
<p>
We use a cookie to help us determine repeat visits to randmcnally.com. This cookie
may be assigned to any user of our website. This cookie does not contain any personally
identifiable information, and simply helps us better understand if we are providing
services that are valuable to our users. If you delete our cookie but have selected
"remember me" in your profile, we will give you a new cookie the next time you log
in. If you use our Maps &amp; Directions features, we may store this information in
a cookie to allow you to more easily re-use this information. Even without using
cookies, you will be able to take advantage of almost all of the features on our
website.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="1"></a><span class="blueTitle">How do we use your information?</span><br>
<br>
The information we collect is used:
<ul>
<li>to generally improve the content and layout of our website</li>
<li>to improve the content and layout of our website for individual visitors</li>
<li>to notify you about updates to our website</li>
<li>to contact you for marketing purposes</li>
<li>in some instances, shared with our parent company and affiliates (the <b>Rand McNally
Affiliates</b>) or other organizations for marketing purposes</li>

<li>for internal review</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you supply us with personal information to request a catalog or order a product,
the information you provide will be added to our customer file (including your name,
address, phone number and e-mail address). You may receive periodic mailings or
telephone contact from us with information on new products and services, discounts,
special promotions or upcoming events that we offer. If you do not want to receive
such mailings from Rand McNally, then please <a href="/contact.do">

<p>
We may send you e-mail with information on new products and services, discounts,
special promotions or upcoming events that are being offered. If you do not wish
to receive such e-mail from us in the future, please <a href="/contact.do">
Click Here</a> for information on where to contact us to remove yourself from
our email list or, click on the "opt-out" link on any e-mail you receive from us.
Please note that when you make a purchase and provide us with your e-mail address,
we may send you confirmation of your order via e-mail even if you have chosen not
to receive future email from us about our products and services. We may also contact
you by mail or telephone if we have questions about your order.
</p>

<p>
We may supply our customer file (including your name, address, phone number and
e-mail address) to certain Rand McNally Affiliates. In addition to information provided
to Rand McNally Affiliates, we may also provide your name, address and phone number
(but not your e-mail address) to a select group of companies who are not Rand McNally
Affiliates and whose products you may find of interest. If you do not want us to
share this information with these companies, we can put you on our "do-not-share"
or "do not call" lists. Please <a href="/contact.do">Click Here</a>
for information on where to contact us if you do not want us to share this information
with Rand McNally Affiliates or other third parties.
</p>
<p>
Note that Rand McNally Affiliates and other third parties with whom we share your
information have their own privacy statements, and those statements apply to your
personal information when it is held by such Rand McNally Affiliates or third parties.
Please refer to the Rand McNally Affiliate or third party privacy statements, as
applicable, for further information on how those entities treat your personal information.</p>
<p>
In some instances, we use third party companies to help us in providing our products
and services to you, to assist us in managing customer information, to fulfill promotions
and to communicate with you. Some of these third party service providers are given
access to some or all of the information you provide to us, including your e-mail
address, and may use cookies on our behalf. These third party service providers
are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than
in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from Rand
McNally.
</p>
<p>
Rand McNally may participate with certain reputable companies who offer you the
ability to establish a membership that would enable you to participate in travel
and entertainment programs. If you elect to activate a trial membership in the Rand
McNally Privilege Pass program, we will provide your name, address and credit card
information to Encore Marketing International, the Rand McNally Privilege Pass service
provider. Rand McNally is not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies
sponsoring these membership programs and we suggest you review the privacy policy
of each company with whom you may be considering a membership.
</p>
<p>
We may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting
us in fraud prevention or investigation. We may do so when: (1) permitted or required
by law; or, (2) trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or
unauthorized transactions; or, (3) investigating fraud which has already taken place.
The information is not provided to these companies for marketing purposes.

</p>
<p>
We may buy or sell business assets or be acquired by or acquire other companies.
In such transactions, personal information generally is one of the transferred business
assets. In addition, in the event that we merge or consolidate with another entity
or there is a change in control of Rand McNally, or, if all or substantially all
of the assets of Rand McNally are sold to a third party, we may transfer your personal
information to the third party. This information may include your name, mailing
address and email address among other information. Please know that if such a transfer
takes place, the third party acquiring the information will be advised of your preferences
about how we use your information. After the transfer takes place, use of your information
is subject to the privacy statement of the third party that acquires it. You should
check that company's privacy statement for information on how it will use your customer
information.</p>

<br>
<a name="2"></a><span class="blueTitle">Third party merchants "Presented by Rand McNally"</span>
<p>
If you make a purchase from a merchant site with a link originating from the Rand
McNally website or a merchant catalog or website "presented by" Rand McNally, the
information you provide to that merchant, such as your credit card number and contact
information, is provided to the merchant and not to Rand McNally. Providing this
information to the merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you
should know that the merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share
your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Rand McNally.
You should also know that these merchants have their own privacy and data collection
practices and are not covered by the Rand McNally Privacy Policy Statement.</p>
<p>
Merchants on the Rand McNally website and those merchants, who send catalogs or
host websites "presented by" Rand McNally, have separate privacy and data collection
practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability
for these independent policies. For more information regarding merchants appearing
on randmcnally.com or other merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented
by" Rand McNally and their privacy policies, please see the merchant's home page
and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any
catalog you may receive from the merchant.</p>

<p>
Merchants that have links on the Rand McNally website may collect personally identifiable
information about you. The information practices of these merchants are not covered
by the Rand McNally Privacy Policy Statement.

<br>
<br>
<a name="3"></a><span class="blueTitle">How do you know your information is secure?</span>
<p>
When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion
of your browser window, then your site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer.
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving
your information on our website. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact
your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive
information, such as financial information, we will redirect you to a secure server
and notify you through a pop-up screen on our website.
</p>
<p>
We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against
the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at
our website so you can feel comfortable and secure.
</p>

<p>
Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of
transmitting credit card numbers.

<br>
<br>
<a name="4"></a><span class="blueTitle">Children's Privacy</span>
<p>
Rand McNally does not seek to solicit information from anyone under the age of thirteen
(a "Child"). If a Child submits information to us through any part of our website,
and we know that the person submitting the information is a Child, we delete the
information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do
we disclose it to third parties. If your child has submitted personal information
to us and you would like to request that such information be removed from our customer
lists, you may contact us using the contact us information listed below, and we
will honor your request.</p>
<p>
While our Rand McNally Classroom product is for use specifically by students, any
usage of the product is allowed only with a single, generic, school access password.
We only count the number of users by school. No personal information is collected
or stored by Rand McNally on student usage of the Classroom services.</p>
<a href="#top">return to top</a>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="5"></a><span class="blueTitle">How can you update your information?</span>
<p>
We will provide you access to the following information if you send us an e-mail,
call us or write to us:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style:none">financial information (such as your credit card account information)</li>
<li style="list-style:none">unique identifier information (your customer number or password)</li>

purchases)</li>
<li style="list-style:none">contact information (your name, address, phone number)</li>

<a name="6"></a><span class="blueTitle">Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement</span>
<p>
From time to time, we may use the information you provide us for new, unanticipated
uses not previously addressed in our Privacy Policy Statement. If our information
practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes on
the privacy page of our website to notify you of these changes, and the revised
Privacy Policy Statement will apply to all of your personal information that we
have on file, provided, however, that we will continue to honor any past requests
not to share your information with third parties. You should check our website periodically
for more information on how we use the data we collect.</p>

<p>
If there is a material change in the manner we use data we collect, we will update
this Privacy Policy Statement to reflect these changes.</p>

<br>
<p>
It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created
this easy-to-read Privacy Policy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers
utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Policy Statement into
a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format
be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation
back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is
possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally
end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Policy Statement upon which it is based.
It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our
Privacy Policy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Policy
Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.</p>
