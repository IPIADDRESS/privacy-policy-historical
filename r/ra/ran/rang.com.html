	<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
	<div class="lines"></div>
</div>

<div class="main one">
	<p>We know you care about how personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By visiting or using the Boomerang website and any other linked pages, features, content, mobile applications or services (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<h4>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h4>
	<p>We know you care about how personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. By visiting or using the Boomerang website and any other This Privacy Policy covers user-submitted information, including your name, email address, gifts you send and receive, users you interact with, and other data you generate while using the Website. It also covers data that we access and may store with your permission from third party applications such as Facebook in order to enhance your experience, including your basic profile information, friend data, and other social data. Finally, it covers information that we gather automatically when you use the Website, including your IP address, browser type, cookie information, and browsing patterns.</p>

	<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Boomerang does not own or control, or to individuals that Boomerang does not employ or manage. In addition, the Website contains links to outside sources, both ones we have added ourselves and ones submitted by others. We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of any web sites you visit.</p>

	<h4>Who Can See My Personal Information?</h4>
	<p>In general, your Facebook friends can view any information you share on Boomerang when they visit the Website. This includes your name, home city, gifts you send and receive, and the users you interact with. We give you the ability to edit and/or delete this information at any time. We do not share your email address with other users.</p>

	<h4>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h4>
	<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way, including information provided by third parties like Facebook when you link such accounts to Boomerang.</p>

	<p>When you connect a third-party account, we receive and store information including your name, user name, email address, check-ins, and profile data. To help you give great, personalized gifts, we may also access data about your friends, including their “Likes” or where they have checked in. The information you provide is used to help you utilize the Boomerang Website, interact with other users to send and receive personalized gifts, customize the content and advertising you see, and communicate with you about specials and new features. We also draw upon this information to better adapt our Website to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network, and to develop new tools for the community. </p>

	<p>When you purchase a paid gift, you will need to submit a credit card or other payment information (debit card, PayPal, etc.) so that our service providers can process your payment. All transactions are processed using industry-standard encryption and Boomerang never directly accesses or stores sensitive payment information.</p>

	<h4>Personal Information Collected Automatically</h4>
	<p>Boomerang automatically receives and stores information from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and browsing patterns. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer through your browser to recognize your browser and tell us how and when you visit pages on our site. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies are needed in order to log into Boomerang.</p>

	<p>Boomerang uses cookie and other browsing data in aggregate form to track Website usage and improve your experience. We may provide usage information to our partners in order to help them understand how often people use their services and our Website. Boomerang never discloses information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

	<h4>Will Boomerang Share My Personal Information With Other Parties?</h4>
	<p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described above and in this section.</p>

	<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through our Website and our emails. In other situations, Boomerang provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a transaction, and it will be clear what Personal Information (if any) will be shared with that affiliated business should you choose to participate.</p>

	<p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them. Unless we tell you differently, Boomerang’s agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>

	<p>Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of other businesses. However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your Personal Information. If you do not wish to receive these offers, you will have the option to unsubscribe using a link found at the bottom of the email. We may provide certain of your Personal Information to third parties if you affirmatively allow us to do so by opting in to an offer we make to you.</p>

	<p>Other Users: When you give a gift to someone through Boomerang, please be aware that we will disclose your real name and email address to the recipient.</p>

	<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Boomerang, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Boomerang goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Boomerang may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

	<p>Protection of Boomerang and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Boomerang, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

	<p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

	<h4>Questions Or Concerns</h4>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at Boomerang, please send a detailed message to privacy@theboomerang.com.</p>

	<h4>Is My Personal Information Secure?</h4>
	<p>Your Boomerang account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Boomerang endeavors to ensure that Personal Information is kept secure. However, Boomerang cannot guarantee the security of this information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

	<h4>How Can I Change or Remove Information on Boomerang?</h4>
	<p>Your Settings page on Boomerang allows you to change Personal Information. In addition, Facebook provides privacy settings that allow you to restrict Boomerang’s access to your data. You can also unlink Boomerang from your Facebook altogether, meaning that no new data from Facebook will be accessed going forward and existing data may be removed. </p>

	<p>If you do not wish to receive email or other notifications from us, please update the "Alerts" section of your Settings page or follow the unsubscribe link found in emails from Boomerang. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, including updates to this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Boomerang Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>

	<h4>Deleting Your Account</h4>
	<p>You may delete your Boomerang account at any time on the Settings page or by emailing contact@theboomerang.com. If you delete your account, your user-submitted data, including a record of gifts you sent and received, will be removed from the site. Because of the way we maintain Boomerang, such deletion may not be immediate, and residual copies of your profile information or posts may remain on backup media.</p>

	<p>Please note that deleting your Boomerang account does not prevent your friends on Facebook from seeing information about you when they use Boomerang. You will need to change your privacy settings in order to restrict the information they make accessible to your friends on third party sites.</p>

	<h4>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h4>
	<p>Boomerang may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect at a given time is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at that time. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy as soon as they are posted.</p>
