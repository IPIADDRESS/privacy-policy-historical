                    <p align="left"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAST UPDATED: 0</strong><strong>4/10/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">In an effort to make website Terms and Privacy information easier to understand for most visitors, AllPlayers Network is joining other software providers and adding a new section called WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW, which provides a summary of critical information most visitors are seeking. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW</strong></p>
<p align="left">AllPlayers uses industry standard cookies to track very basic information about your actions on our Site, such as landing pages, exit pages, time on the site, location (as in city you are from, not home address), operating system and search terms used to locate us. That is not a complete list, because there are forms people fill out to participate in activities and other interactions you have with the school and/or military base using our software. However for most people who assume websites are tracking every little bit of data about them you may rest assured AllPlayers is not that type of site, nor do we have partners who would support malicious tracking. With that said it is always a good idea to keep your cookies and sessions cleaned out frequently, because Google, Amazon and virtually every large organization are very good at tracking your actions, and we do use them to help with some services. </p>
<p align="left">For example we use Google Adwords to place ads relevant to you on our site, and we use Google Adsense to track the information listed above. We also use Amazon AWS to manage and host some of our storage and services. Because we use Google Adsense, and they know a lot about your web activity you may see advertisements that are unrelated to our Site, but this does not mean our Site knows anything it is just Google. </p>
<p align="left">Third-party shared data. We have several brands we own, which are listed toward the end of the document, and because they have different URLs we call them third-party services. We share information between these services to make your utilization of our software easier, but we do not sell your information to third-party organizations. </p>
<p align="left">In summary, we do not sell your data, and we do everything we can to insure your trust and patronage is rewarded, not exploited. </p>
<p align="left">Now here is the legal stuff states, and merchant services providers require. </p>
<p align="left"> This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs the specific Internet website, application or other interactive service that includes an authorized link to this Privacy Policy and all other websites, applications and other interactive services you also use that are offered by AllPlayers Network, Inc., (“APN”) for use on mobile devices, tablets, personal computers and other devices, which includes the websites and online services, (collectively, the “Site”).

This Privacy Policy describes what information the Site collects from users, including children, when they visit the Site; how such information is used and stored; when such information may be disclosed to third parties; how users, parents, and guardians can control the use and disclosure of collected information; and how information is protected.</p>
<p align="left">
  Your privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protection for children on the Site permitting such visitors. Our privacy practices are guided by the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as well as data privacy laws in the United States and other applicable countries. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information.<br>
  <strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>I.&nbsp; INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.</strong> </p>
<p align="left"> We may request or collect certain information when you visit the Site. However, visitors are required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in the particular activity.&nbsp; <strong><u>You may remove any information you provide to the Site at any time, at your sole discretion.</u></strong> </p>

If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child may be asked to provide his or her parent’s or guardian’s email address.</p>
<p align="left">
  Registration information is used to enable visitors to log into their accounts across different devices and platforms; take advantage of the Site, Site’s service offerings; respond to requests for products, services, and information; send communications to users in connection with their account; manage schedules; serve appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Site; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from the Site, as well as on behalf of selected third parties offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p align="left"> B.

When you use these social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may be shared with us.<br>
  When you use social networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on the social networking platform about your use of the Site. Such services may also employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.</p>
<p align="left"> C. Computer Information Collected by Us: When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor’s IP address, the web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Site, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a site (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard server log information (“Computer Information”).</p>
<p align="left"> We may use cookies, web beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking Technologies”) on the Site. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. “Tokens” are unique persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobe’s Pass service, to a user’s device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication for a user’s cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie. The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
<p align="left"> We may use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain sites without logging into each site, enable the internal functioning of the Site, understand the Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on the Site, personalize your experience on the Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages originating from the Site (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password, save your settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site. These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional other information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features, purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple sessions on the Site and other websites and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the device you use to access the site (“Identifier”). An Identifier may be automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Site.<br>
  By visiting a Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on your device and track your activities and your use of a Site through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>
<p align="left"> D.

Site use a variety of third-party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site (“Targeting Services”). These Targeting Services enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products and services that may interest you. Targeting Services also help prevent you from seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain advertisements.</p>
<p align="left"> These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to other information about you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log data separately and independently from what the Site collect.</p>
<p align="left"> You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not the Site. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We encourage you to research and direct any of your questions in this regard to these third parties.</p>

The standard messaging rates of your wireless carrier shall apply to all Text Services, unless noted otherwise.
