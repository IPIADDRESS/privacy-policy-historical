                        Additionally, if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
                        prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
                        involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Califoia residents: Under Califoia Civil Code Section 1798.83,
                        also known as Senate Bill 27, if you are a Califoia resident and ROS has an established
                        business relationship with you, you have the right to request information from ROS,
                        free of charge, regarding the manner in which ROS shares certain categories of your
                        personal information with third parties (whether collected online or offline), for
                        the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Califoia law provides that you
                        have the right to submit a request to ROS at its designated address and receive
                        the following information: 1) the categories of information ROS disclosed to third
                        parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding
                        calendar year; 2) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information;
                        and 3) if the nature of a third party’s business cannot be reasonably determined
                        from the third party’s name, examples of the products or services marketed,
                        subject to certain exceptions. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information
                        in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually.
                        For purposes of this paragraph “Third Party” means: (i) a business that
                        is outside the ROS family, and (ii) affiliates of ROS Technologies, Inc.&nbsp;You
                        will notice that the "third parties" listed in this notice are ROS affiliates.
                        These affiliates are listed as "third parties" because, under Senate Bill
                        27, any business that is a separate legal entity must be listed as a "third
                        party."&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ROS affiliates who may have received your information
                        are as follow
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same Califoia law permits ROS to provide you, in response
                        to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information
                        shared rather than providing the above described information.
                        <br>
                        ROS’ designated email address for such requests is bmann@rankonesport.com.
                        You may also request this information by writing to: Mr. Wayne Poage 18400 Creekview
                        Rd. Sanger, TX&nbsp;76266.&nbsp;Additionally, you may request that ROS not share
                        your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use by following
                        the Choice/Opt-Out procedures outlined above.
