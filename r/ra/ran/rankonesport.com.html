<div class="titleBlack">Privacy Policy</div>
<div class="txtBlack"><div align="center"><strong> </strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rank One Sport LP, a Texas limited partnership (“ROS”), has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the site located at<span class="txtLink"><a href="http://www.rankonesport.com">www.rankonesport.com</a></span> and other affiliated websites owned and operated by ROS and its affiliates (the “Site”).</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROS’s sites have been developed to assist colleges and high schools across the United States with their scheduling needs. We provide information regarding those users schedules to the general public once the owner chooses to make the schedule public.&nbsp; As such, you understand that other users may have access that you post on ROS’s sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="titleSmall">Information Collected and Disclosed</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you visit ROS you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Site.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you use ROS, you may set up your personal profile, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features.&nbsp; In order to become a ROS user, you must first create an account on this Site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: E-Mail address, physical address, phone numbers and names of the individuals that will have access to the system.&nbsp; Once a user, you may provide additional information about yourself and others. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better use the functionalities of the Site.&nbsp; Depending on your account settings, some or all of this information may be shared with other ROS users.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You post information on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your content. ROS and its affiliates are the owners of the information collected on this Site.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our servers also automatically record information when you visit our Sites or use some of our products, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, nature of your request and the date and time of your request.&nbsp; We may then use this information and other information about activities on the Site to create aggregate non-personal information.&nbsp; "Aggregate non-personal information" is information that is recorded about users and collected into groups so that it no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROS maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your nonpublic personal information.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROS restricts access to your nonpublic personal information to those employees who need to know that information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law, however, we may choose to disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other similar companies with whom we have joint marketing agreements.&nbsp; We also display targeted advertisements based on personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; We provide information to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. ROS may share aggregate non-personal information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics related to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Additionally, if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also transfer information about you if ROS is acquired by or merged with another company. <br>
We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="titleSmall">Cookies; Use of IP Addresses and Web Analytics</div>
<p><br>
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.&nbsp; A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages you’ve visited.<br>
When you register at the Site, ROS uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.&nbsp; We do not store passwords or any personal information about you. We use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track information while you are on our Site.&nbsp; Cookies also enable you to enter the Site as a registered user without having to log on each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the&nbsp; Site.&nbsp; However, if you turn off cookies, then you may not be able to utilize certain features of the Site.<br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
Our Site also utilizes web analytics to determine which aspects of the Site result in users having a desired site experience.&nbsp; The data we collected includes web traffic reports, user performance data, and other custom metrics to determine Site performance and improve audience response.&nbsp; Information recorded through these analytics is used to report anonymous individual and/or aggregate information about our users to our partners. Aggregate information may include demographic and usage information. No personally identifiable information about you is shared with partners from this research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="titleSmall">Security</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your security, certain portions of our Site are encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer Protocol (“SSL”) technology on both the client and server end.&nbsp; VeriSign has issued ROS a unique ID, which assures visitors that they have reached our authenticated Site, thereby allowing communications to be encrypted.&nbsp; In order for 128-bit SSL to work, though, you must have a browser that supports SSL technology.<br>
Please note that e‑mail may not be encrypted and cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information.&nbsp; ROS will never ask you to submit your financial data such as your credit card account numbers via e-mail.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.&nbsp; When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we use 128-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp; Only those individuals and entities who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Furthermore, all parties who receive sensitive information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp; We frequently notify and/or remind those parties about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.&nbsp; Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, with access restricted. <br>
Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="titleSmall">
<p>Linked Sites</p>
</div>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that ROS may not be responsible for content or the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="titleSmall">Children’s Privacy</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If ROS obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information is immediately and permanently deleted from our records.&nbsp; If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at 940-594-5961 <br>
We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><div class="titleSmall"><strong>Choice/Opt&nbsp;Out</strong></div><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can edit your Account Information, including your marketing preferences, at any time.&nbsp; If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, you may call ROS at the following number: 1-940-594-5961.Youcan delete your account by visiting our contact us&nbsp; Information page. Certain information might possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted, such as aggregate non-personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the our service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.&nbsp; Additionally, as we can’t identify which information is yours, we will not be able to delete your de-identified information once it becomes aggregate non-personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
</p><div class="titleSmall">State Specific Disclosures</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>For California residents:</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as Senate Bill 27, if you are a California resident and ROS has an established business relationship with you, you have the right to request information from ROS, free of charge, regarding the manner in which ROS shares certain categories of your personal information with third parties (whether collected online or offline), for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to ROS at its designated address and receive the following information: 1) the categories of information ROS disclosed to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; 2) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information; and 3)&nbsp;if the nature of a third party’s business cannot be reasonably determined from the third party’s name, examples of the products or services marketed, subject to certain exceptions. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually. For purposes of this paragraph “Third Party” means: (i) a business that is outside the ROS family, and (ii) affiliates of ROS Technologies, Inc.&nbsp; You will notice that the "third parties" listed in this notice are ROS affiliates. These affiliates are listed as "third parties" because, under Senate Bill 27, any business that is a separate legal entity must be listed as a "third party."&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ROS affiliates who may have received your information are as follows:<p></p>
<p><br>
<strong> &lt;no entites&gt;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This same California law permits ROS to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. <br>
ROS’ designated email address for such requests is bmann@rankonesport.com. You may also request this information by writing to: Mr. Wayne Poage 18400 Creekview Rd. Sanger, TX&nbsp; 76266.&nbsp; Additionally, you may request that ROS not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use by following the Choice/Opt-Out procedures outlined above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Vermont residents: </strong>Vermont law places additional limits on sharing information about Vermont residents.&nbsp; As long as a user remains a resident of Vermont, we will not share information we collect about Vermont residents to companies outside of ROS or to ROS affiliates, except: (i) To companies that perform marketing or other services on our behalf; (ii) Contact information (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment history) with which we have joint marketing agreements; (iii) With the authorization or consent of the Vermont resident; or (iv) As permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>For Nevada residents:</strong> We do not share your information with nonaffiliated third parties for purposes of their offering products and services to you.
