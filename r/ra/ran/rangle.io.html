    <h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>Rangle.io Inc. (here referred to as Rangle.io or "we") respects all individuals' preferences concerning the collection and use of their personal information ("data"). Our goal is to run several opt-in mailing lists and contests at events which will provide our mailing-list subscribers and our website visitors, and third party conference attendees ("users") with information they will find relevant. This policy statement is here to let you know how we collect data, why we collect it, and what choices you have concerning its use.</p>

<p>Please note that Rangle.io maintains the same privacy practices described in this policy for data we collect off-line; accordingly, references below to online subscribers also apply to individuals from whom we collect data off-line (for example, on mailing list sign-up forms circulated at conferences or local meetup events or through research for organizations who share our interests).</p>

<p>Rangle.io’s main office is located at:
82 Peter Street, 3rd floor.
Toronto, Ontario
Canada
M5V 2G5</p>

<h4>Data Collection Methods</h4>

<p>Rangle.io collects data related to our users through the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>The registration form for our online opt-in mailing through our main site: <a href="http://rangle.io">http://rangle.io</a> or a landing page, or contest entry page, that we host. We may also have distinct media, contests and other event-specific sign-up forms.</li>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Sign-up sheets which are circulated at events</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of Information</h4>

<p>The data collected may include the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subscribers' contact information (name, address, company, title, phone, fax, email, web, social media handles)</li>
<li>A selection of interests for future communications</li>
<li>The subscriber's choices as to why we may contact them</li>
<li>The subscriber’s work title, company, and industry they work in</li>
<li>The subscriber's IP address and geographic location</li>
</ul>

<h4>Consent</h4>

<p><em>How do you get my consent?</em></p>

<p>When you provide us with personal information to sign-up for our e-newsletter list, or to enter your information to sign-up for one of our contests at an event, you’re implying that you consent to our collecting your information and using it for that specific reason only.</p>

<p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no. Users can read this Privacy Statement on our website, where we have included a link.</p>

<p>Users who opt in via a website's mailing list sign-up form will immediately be able to view a ‘Thank You’ page or inline ‘Thank You’ text, which indicates that their submission has been received.</p>

<p><em>How do I withdraw my consent?</em></p>

<p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rangle.io">privacy@rangle.io</a> or mailing us at: Rangle.io Inc. 82 Peter St. Toronto Ontario Canada M5V 2G5</p>
