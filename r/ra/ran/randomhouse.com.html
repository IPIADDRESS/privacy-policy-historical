<font color="#003366"><b>HOW BOOKS@RANDOM USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:</b></font><br>
This site does not collect personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  A user's personally identifying information will not be sold or rented to any other party.  To enable users to receive automatic notification of updates to some areas of Books@Random, a user's personally identifying information may be shared with a third party who provides this service.
<br>
<br>
A user's personally identifying information may also be used by Random House, Inc., its parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates for editorial, marketing, or promotional purposes.  Users can opt out of such use by e-mailing the following information to <a href="mailto:business@randomhouse.com">business@randomhouse.com</a>:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>	
1) The subject line should include the word:  REMOVE<br>

2) The body of the message should include:<br>

	&nbsp;a. your e-mail address<br>
	
	&nbsp;b. a description of the area where you signed up<br><br>

<br>
<br>
Books@Random users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
<br>
<br>
While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we sometimes collect anonymous aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers for statistical purposes.  For example, we might report to advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between the ages of 35 and 45.  In addition, non-personally identifying information my be used by Random House, Inc. for marketing analysis purposes.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#003366"><b>COOKIES:</b></font><br>  
Books@Random may place a "cookie" in the browser file of a Books@Random user's computer.  The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information although it will enable Books@Random to relate a user's use of Books@Random to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided to Books@Random.  From time to time, Books@Random hosts advertiser banners.  If you link to our advertisers, you may also occasionally get cookies from them.  Books@Random does not control these cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy.  The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet industry.  Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  However, it is possible that some portions of Books@Random will not function properly if you do so.
