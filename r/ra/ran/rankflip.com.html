				<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">PRIVACY POLICY Last Updated: June 11 2010 RankFlip strives to offer its  visitors                    the many advantages of Internet technology and to  provide an                    interactive and personalized experience. We may use  Personally                    Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,  street                    address, telephone number) subject to the terms of  this                    privacy policy. <strong>We will never sell, barter, or rent  your email                    address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</strong> How  we                    gather information from users How we collect and store                     information depends on the page you are visiting, the                    activities in which you elect to participate and the  services                    provided. For example, you may be asked to provide  information                    when you register for access to certain portions of  our site                    or request certain features, such as newsletters or  when you                    make a purchase. You may provide information when you                    participate in sweepstakes and contests, message  boards and                    chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.  Like most                    Web sites, we also collect  information                    automatically and through the use of electronic tools  that may                    be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may  log the                    name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie                    technology to recognize you and hold information from  your                    visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your  user name                    and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that                     information each time you visit, or may control the  number of                    times you encounter a particular advertisement while  visiting                    our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may  also                    gather information through other means. In certain  cases, you                    can choose not to provide us with information, for  example by                    setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but  if you                    do you may be unable to access certain portions of the  site or                    may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,  and we                    may not be able to customize the site’s features  according to                    your preferences. What we do with the information we  collect                    Like other Web publishers, we collect information to  enhance                    your visit and deliver more individualized content and                     advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share  your                    information with anyone. Aggregated Information  (information                    that does not personally identify you) may be used in  many                    ways. For example, we may combine information about  your usage                    patterns with similar information obtained from other  users to                    help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn  which pages                    are visited most or what features are most  attractive).                    Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with  our                    advertisers and business partners. Again, this  information                    does not include any Personally Identifiable  Information about                    you or allow anyone to identify you individually. We  may use                    Personally Identifiable Information collected on RankFlip to communicate with you  about your                    registration and customization preferences; our Terms  of                    Service and privacy policy; services and products  offered by RankFlip and other topics we think  you might find                    of interest. Personally Identifiable Information  collected by RankFlip may also be used for other  purposes,                    including but not limited to site administration,                    troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce  transactions,                    administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other                    communications with you. Certain third parties who  provide                    technical support for the operation of our site (our  Web                    hosting service for example) may access such  information. We                    will use your information only as permitted by law. In                     addition, from time to time as we continue to develop  our                    business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with  other                    companies or businesses. In such transactions, user                    information may be among the transferred assets. We  may also                    disclose your information in response to a court  order, at                    other times when we believe we are reasonably required  to do                    so by law, in connection with the collection of  amounts you                    may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities  whenever                    we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we  may not                    provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such  cases.                    Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements RankFlip expects its partners,  advertisers and                    affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be  aware,                    however, that third parties, including our partners,                    advertisers, affiliates and other content providers  accessible                    through our site, may have their own privacy and data                    collection policies and practices. For example, during  your                    visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a  frame                    on a RankFlip page, certain content  that is                    actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,  through RankFlip you may be introduced to, or  be able to                    access, information, Web sites, features, contests or                    sweepstakes offered by other parties. RankFlip is                    not responsible for the actions or policies of such  third                    parties. You should check the applicable privacy  policies of                    those third parties when providing information on a  feature or                    page operated by a third party. While on our site, our                     advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may                    use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify  some of                    your preferences or retrieve information about you.  For                    example, some of our advertising is served by third  parties                    and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to                    determine whether you have seen a particular  advertisement                    before. Other features available on our site may offer                     services operated by third parties and may use cookies  or                    other technology to gather information. RankFlip                    does not control the use of this technology by third  parties                    or the resulting information, and is not responsible  for any                    actions or policies of such third parties. You should  also be                    aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable                    Information on message boards or in chat areas, that                    information can be viewed publicly and can be  collected and                    used by third parties without our knowledge and may  result in                    unsolicited messages from other individuals or third  parties.                    Such activities are beyond the control of RankFlip&nbsp;                    and this policy.

If we discover we have received any                    information from a child under 13 in violation of this  policy,                    we will delete that information immediately.

Information collected prior to  the time                    any change is posted will be used according to the  rules and                    laws that applied at the time the information was  collected.                    Governing law This policy and the use of this Site are                     governed by Minnesota law. If a dispute arises under  this                    Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the  help of a                    mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following  location: Minnesota. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees  associated                    with the mediation will be shared equally by each of  us. If it                    proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory                     solution through mediation, we agree to submit the  dispute to                    binding arbitration at the following location: Minnesota,                    under the rules of the United States Of America.                    Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration  may be                    entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so. RankFlip is controlled, operated and  administered                    entirely within Minnesota.
