<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>About this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our service and what may happen to the information we collect.</p>

<h3>Application of this Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to RateSpecial and all websites (“Site” or “Sites”) owned and controlled by RateSpecial,LLC. (“RateSpecial”, “we”, or “us”). Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to Sites owned and controlled by RateSpecial and not to websites maintained by other companies to which we may link.</p>

<p>By registering with us (i.e. through the submission of the information requested, including your personally identifiable information) on this Site or otherwise using or accessing this Site, you agree that the following terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy shall govern our use and disclosure of your personal information. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, please do not complete any information request forms (i.e., do not register) hosted on this site or otherwise use or access this Site.</p>  

<p>This Site is not directed at persons under the age of 18. Persons under the age of 18 must not send any personal information to Ratespecial under any circumstances, including but not limited to name, address or email address.</p>

<h3>Your Privacy is Important to Us</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains what information we obtain on the Site and how we use the information you disclose to us, including how we may provide your information to our Third Party Providers who have expressed a willingness to provide you with the products and services associated with this Site, as well as other products and/or services that we and they believe may be of interest to you.</p>   

<p>By entering your contact information, you are authorizing us, or a Third Party Provider, to contact you with exciting new offers and information, via email and automated telephone messages, even if you are listed on a Do Not Call Registry. Users may opt out of the Companies disclosure to such third parties by following the instructions in the opt-out section of this privacy policy. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you as permitted by law.</p>   

<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<p>We are an online consumer service that introduces persons such as yourself to certain of our Third Party Providers who have expressed a general willingness to review your information and determine if they are willing to provide you with the services or products that prompted you to visit our Site, as well as other products and/or services that we and they believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>The information that we collect includes personal information about you that we or certain of our Third Party Providers consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your qualifications to receive applicable products and/or services. To the extent that you can order products or subscribe to a service(s), the type of personally identifiable information that may be collected may include: name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card information; information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage rate and the like. To the extent that you are requested and you do submit information about other people, such information will be limited recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>In addition to the personal information you provide to us, we collect certain information online and offline arising out of your use of our Site, including but not limited to the number and type of offers you have responded to and completed. When you visit our Site, we automatically tracks certain non personally identifiable information with respect to your behavior on the Site through the cookie we place in your browser. This non personally identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just came from and the URL to which you go next; your computer browser information; and your IP address. We use this non personally identifiable information in conjunction with some of the information that you provided to conduct internal research on users’ demographics and behavior and to better understand how to serve users of the Site. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. Third parties may also set cookies on or through the service to track Site usage and to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his/her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user’s computer until manually deleted. You may decline our cookies if your Web browser software permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features of the Service.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>We track certain non personally identifiable information through server log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks to analyze trends and administer the Site, track user’s movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses the Site. We do not tie server log files to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We may employ and certain Third Party Providers may employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs). Clear gifs help us better manage content through the service by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier. Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In addition, we and certain Third Party Providers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us and the Third Party Provider to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened. We do not tie clear gifs to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>We may perform a preliminary validation of any information that you submit to Ratespecial and an evaluation of your qualifications for our Third Party Providers’ products and services. For example, we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy based upon past usage and response; or compare your information against other publicly available files; or validate some of the personal information to verify that the information you submitted has a high probability of being valid information.</p>

<p>Based upon your affirmative consent, as evidenced by your clicking on the applicable acknowledgement box and/or your registration on a Site (i.e., your submission of the requested information, including your personally identifiable information), we may use the information you provide to attempt to match you with providers of products and services (for example, using your zip code to check for service providers whose service area covers your location) and/or we may forward the information that you provided directly to certain of our Third Party Providers. We may sell or transfer individual information to other Third Parties for any legally permissible purpose, please see Sharing Your Information.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain about you to create a general user profile. This profile may be created by combining your information with other sources of information such as information obtained from public databases, or from your browsing habits surrounding your visit to this Site.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may contact you via e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising or other means to inform you of additional opportunities to receive special offers for other services and/or products that we believe may be of interest to you. By providing your contact information when using the Service, you are entering into a business relationship with Ratespecial and are further requesting, and expressly consenting to, being contacted by Ratespecial and our Third Party Providers via telephone, fax, email, surface mail or any other means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state or other applicable “Do Not Call” list, in order that Ratespecial may provide the services set forth on the Site or for other purposes reasonably related to your service request and the business of Ratespecial, including marketing-related emails. You are under no obligation to accept any service or product offered through these communications.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may send you certain transactional messages relating to the Service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, etc.</p>

<h3>How We Protect Your Privacy</h3>

<p>We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.</p>

<p>Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, our Third Party Providers are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by the FTC. If we learn that any of our Third Party Providers is breaching our agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if necessary, terminating our relationship with such Third Party Partner.</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor should you expect that your personal information would always remain private.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can mail us at the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.</p>
