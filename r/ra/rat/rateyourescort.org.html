            Privacy Policy </h4>
            <p><span class="style1" style="font-weight: bold">A. My picture/ad is online and I was not aware of it?</span><strong><br>
            </strong>We can't determinte the true identity of posters. If there is any personal information/picture that is publicly available without your consent, we reserve the right to remove this information as soon as we can. If this is ever the case, volunteer administrators will do the best to satisfy such requests at shortest time possible. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">B. Someone has left a bad review. Can I have it off?</span> <br>
            All reviews/comments that are found offensive or inappropriate will be removed.<br>
            The following, but not limited to, will be considered as offensive: inappropriate language, negative feedback with no detailed information, obscene language, irrelevant comments, comments revealing identity excluding business number and business email, discriminatory comments. <br>
            Due to limited resources we are not able to screen all comments. It is ad owner's responsibility to report any inappropriate comments which will be followed by removal by our volunteer administrators as soon as possible. However, for fairness and valid reviews we do not <span style="font-style: italic">remove</span> <em>reviews</em> if we have a genuine reviewer and the review is not offensive or does not apply. The review board belongs to community and is managed by volunteer administrators. Administrators are not <span style="font-style: italic">required</span> to satisfy all requests. Users signing up accept the risk that bad review/comments are posted to their profile. </p>
            <p><span class="style1" style="font-weight: bold">C. What information do you collect, how is it collected and how do you use it?</span> <br>
            Anyone can visit our site free of charge. You are welcome to browse others' reviews and read comments without ever giving us your individual information. But we do need to gather some information about users who wish to leave comments and reviews. We collect information directly and through cookies but this is only to enhance your experience in the web site. Your information will not be shared anyone.</p>
            <p>First, if you want to rate something, we will ask you to provide your email. We collect this information for security purposes only. We reserve the right to remove your reviews and comments without notice. If proof is available to us, reviews from anyone under 19 will be removed from the system.</p>
            <p>One of the reasons we ask for your e-mail address is so that we can communicate with you and possibly send you the latest information about <em>Rate Your Escorts</em>. If you don't want to hear from us, we promise to leave you alone! Many of our members, however, enjoy getting news from us and being informed of special promotions or opportunities.</p>
            <p>Second, when you register with <em>Rate Your Escorts</em>, a "cookie" may be placed on your computer. Cookies are bits of information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping and activity-tracking purposes. Cookies cannot be used to learn your identity unless you have previously provided that information to that web site or your web browser automatically provides that information. Other web sites, including some of our advertisers, may also place cookies on your hard drive, but if you have not previously provided your identity to the web site and your browser does not automatically provide your identity, an advertiser will not be able to use a cookie to learn your identity.</p>
            <p> We may also collect log files that identify information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, referral URL, country of origin, pages visited, entry points, and exit points, but we do NOT link those files to personally identifying information.</p>
            <p>We plan that, from time to time, we will provide certain companies (like our advertisers) with aggregated user information, but this will NOT contain any individual information. We will NOT give advertisers or anyone else personal information about you without your specific authorization to do so, except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy. While we don't do it now, we expect that one day other businesses may ask us to do things like "broker" on-line focus groups, in which we may invite some users to participate (if they have chosen to be notified of those opportunities).</p>
            <p>Our site may occasionally request information from users via surveys or sweepstakes. Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving your use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
            <p>Of course, notwithstanding anything in this policy to the contrary, we will provide personal information if we are or believe that we are legally required to do so pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, other legal method or applicable law. <br>
              <span class="style1" style="font-weight: bold"><br>
                D. How is my privacy protected when I leave comments? </span><br>

In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have aggreed to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. <br>

                <span class="style1" style="font-weight: bold">F. What kind of security measures do you take?</span><strong> <br>
