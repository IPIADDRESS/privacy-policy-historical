<p>This Privacy Notice sets out the data processing practices carried out through the use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks including apps and tablets (we use the term ‘Website’ to refer to any and all types of technology including websites that you use to access our content and services) by Rated People Limited (RPL). If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to these practices please <a href="http://www.ratedpeople.com/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>1. What Personal Information About Users Do We Gather?</h2>
<p>Rated People Limited (“we”, “us”, or “RPL”) collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you. When we do so we are regulated under the Data Protection Laws which include the Data Protection Act 1998 and any replacement legislation, and the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). The Data Protection Laws apply across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom) and we are responsible as ‘controller’ of that personal information for the purposes of those Laws. The information we gather about Users helps us personalise and continually improve your Rated People experience. Some Users of our Website will also be Members. You are a Member if you register on our Website as a Client or a Trade Business. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. By registering with RPL as a Member via our Website, you choose to accept the practices described in this Privacy Notice. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as set out in here. Please note that it is possible to authorise another individual to operate and manage your account on your behalf. However, if you have such an arrangement in place, you still remain primarily responsible for the use of your account, and any liability that may arise in connection with that use, including for any and all payments due under it or claims brought against you in respect of that use.</li>
<li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies”, and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Website or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of RPL on other websites.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile/Tablet:</strong> When you download or use apps created by us or on our behalf, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device.</li>
<li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mails from us if your computer or device supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our Users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your <a href="https://www.ratedpeople.com/account/my-account/contact-preferences">Contact Preferences</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook and other Social media platforms:</strong> You may integrate your account with social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. By doing so you authorise us to collect your information, such as your username, encrypted access credentials, and other information, that may be available on or through your social media account. Such information may include your name, profile picture, country, hometown, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, friends’ names and profile pictures and networks. We may store this information and use it for the purposes explained in here and to verify your credentials with social media platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Information From Other Sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.</li>

<h2>2. What About Cookies?</h2>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide product features, personalised advertisements on other websites, and to remember your requests for services (if you are a Client) or job lead purchases (if you are a Trade Business) between visits.</li>
<li>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Since cookies will allow you to take advantage of some of the Website’s product features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to post requests for services or buy job leads, or use any of our online products and services that require you to sign in.</li>
<li>Please read our <a href="/c/cookies">cookies policy</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about the specific cookies used on this website, please see below:</p>

<td><strong>Cookies necessary for essential website purposes</strong></td>
<td>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. These cookies are necessary for us to supply you with certain online features like transactional pages and secure login accounts.</td>
<td>You may disable any of these cookies via your browser settings. If you do so, various functions of the Website may be unavailable to you or may not work the way you want them to.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></td>
<td>Functionality cookies record information about choices you’ve made and allow us to tailor the Website to you. These cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Website, we can provide you with our services as you have asked for them to be provided. For example, these cookies allow us to:<p></p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li>Save your location preferences;</li>
<li>Remember settings you have applied, such as layout, text size, preferences, and colours;</li>

<tr>
<td><strong>Advertising Cookies (Interest- Based Ads)</strong></td>
<td>RPL displays interest-based advertising on its Website and on unaffiliated websites, using information that you make available to us when visiting the Website. Interest-based ads (also referred to as personalised or targeted ads) are displayed based on information from activities such as your visits and use of these websites. Information about the types of information that we gather is set out in the Automatically Collected Information section of this Privacy Policy.</td>

<h2>3. Interest-Based Ads</h2>
<p>In addition to using cookies and interest-based ads (as discussed above), we also use web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs) and other technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”). Tracking technologies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our Website and on other websites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated websites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.</p>
<p>In environments that do not support tracking technologies, like some mobile devices and applications, we may use other anonymous technologies for these purposes. To serve our ads in mobile applications we collect identifiers, such as Google Advertising ID or IDFA depending on the operating system of your mobile device. These identifiers consist in a string of anonymous and random characters singling out your device, that our partners may store using a non-reversible encrypting method.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party websites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content has targeted. Some third parties may provide us with information about you (such as the websites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>
<p>Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf may use technology to serve the ads that appear on our Website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or have any control over tracking technologies or other features that advertisers and third party websites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly or visit their websites for more information about their privacy practices.</p>

<h2>4. What About Use Of Your Personal Information To Prevent Or Detect Fraud?</h2>
<p>When you apply through the Website to register with us, we may check our own and the following records about you and your business partners:</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li>Those at fraud prevention agencies (FPAs);</li>
<li>If you are a director, we will seek confirmation from credit reference agencies (CRAs) that the residential address that you provide is the same as that shown on the restricted register of directors’ usual addresses at Companies House.</li>
</ul>
<p>We work with a third party (iOvation) for fraud detection and prevention purposes, and to improve the experience of our Users who do not pose a fraud risk. iOvation maintains a central database of devices and internet users that pose a fraud threat to businesses and others on the web. This information is used to mitigate the risk and potential impact of fraudulent activity on our Website and the websites of other users of the iOvation platform. RPL use this service and if we detect potential or actual fraudulent activity then such activity and certain identifying data will be reported to the iOvation database.</p>
<p>In addition, if you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify fraud we will record this and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention.</p>
<p>We may also check your business records at CRAs. When CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your business credit file that may be seen by lenders. CRAs supply to us public information (including information from the electoral register) and fraud prevention information. Where such checks are carried out by us, they are necessary for to enable us to enter into contractual arrangements with you as a Trade Business. If you fail a check carried out by us with a CRA, this will automatically disqualify your application. You will be informed if this is the case and may appeal to the us by contacting <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f59194819485879a819096819c9a9bb5879481909185909a859990db969a98">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> when your application will be considered by an individual.</p>
<p>We will make checks including verifying identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us particularly if you are a Professional. In addition, if you apply to pay for our services in arrears, information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by them. This will include information on your business and its proprietors and CRAs may create a record of the name and address of your business and its proprietors if there is not one already.</p>
<p>RPL and other organisations may access and use information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more, you can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK. The information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee.</p>

<h2>5. Does RPL Share The Information It Receives?</h2>
<p>Information about our Members is an important part of our business. We share Member information only as described below and with controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. We do not typically share personal information about Users who are not Members.</p>
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul class="list list--bullet list--paragraph-like">
<li><strong>When You Post A Request For Services:</strong> We share Client information (full name, postcode, email address and phone number) with Trade Businesses that respond to a Client’s request for services. Trade Businesses must comply with the Trade Business Code of Conduct concerning how they deal with Clients and use Client information. Here we are using your information to fulfill our contractual obligations to you.</li>
<li><strong>When You Respond To A Request For Services:</strong> We share Trade Business’s information (name, full address including postcode, email address and phone number) with Clients when they respond to a request for services. Here we are using your information to fulfill our contractual obligations to you. In pursuit of our interest in providing Clients with access to legitimate Trade Businesses and ensuring the positive reputation and user experience of the Website is upheld, in the event of a dispute between a Client and a Trade Business, we will make available any other personal information we hold on a Trade Business that is pertinent to that dispute and may, in our judgment assist in the fair and reasonable resolution of that dispute.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliated And Other Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> We work closely with other businesses. For instance, you may have the option to buy products and services from third parties through the Website.

You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we may share Member information with that third party in order to provide you with the services you have requested. We may share anonymous, aggregate information with third parties for their own research and marketing purposes but we will not share your personal information with such third parties without your consent. In providing these options we are pursuing our legitimate business interests having assessed these interests against the benefit to you of the additional products and services and the risks associated with the information we share.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We appoint third party companies and individuals as data processors to perform functions on our behalf. We will provide your personal data to such data processors in order for them to assist us in providing you with services. In some circumstances we may need to share personal data with such data processors in advance of you requesting a specific service, for instance so that the data processor can contact you regarding services that are within your membership package but to which you may not have signed up. The information shared with data processors may include your RPL User ID, name, email address, phone number and postal address. Our data processors will only have access to personal data needed to allow them to make our services available to you and will only use your personal data for this purpose. Examples of services provided on our behalf by our third party service providers include operation and administration of our member benefits portal, removing repetitive information from User lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing anti-fraud services and providing customer services. In sharing your information with these parties we are pursuing our legitimate business interests having assessed those interests against the benefits to you of the additional efficiencies gained by the use of third party suppliers, assured ourselves of the ability of those third party service providers to control and protect your information and taken account of the types of personal information we share.</li>
<li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we run competitions or send offers available to all Members or selected groups of RPL Members jointly with or on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address unless you have consented. If you wish to change your ability to receive such offers, you can adjust your contact preferences at any time by following the link contained in any of our marketing communications or accessing <a href="https://www.ratedpeople.com/account/my-account/contact-preferences">the Website</a> and following the instructions.</li>
<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy products, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, User information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the User is notified otherwise). Also, in the event that we or our successor or substantially all of our assets are acquired, User information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li>

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. We work with individual identity data providers to obtain information about Members from the Electoral Register and other sources to verify identity. We may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open or during the operation of your account. We may where we deem it necessary search credit reference agency files to assess a Client’s ability to fund extensive jobs or services requests or seek forms of identity verification. If we need to do so, we will seek each Client’s consent in advance.</li>
