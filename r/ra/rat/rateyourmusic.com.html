<p></p><blockquote>
<b>Rateyourmusic.com privacy policy</b><br><br>

rateyourmusic.com considers privacy to be a very important issue.  Please
read the privacy policy below to learn how we treat personally identifiable
information.
<br><br>
<b>Definition:</b><br><br>

when we refer to the word 'user' in this privacy policy, we refer to 
all people that access this web site, whether they are registered or 
not.   The term 'registered user' refers only to users who have registered
to use this service.
<br><br>
<b>COPPA Policy:</b>
<br><br>
To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, rateyourmusic.com will instruct users under the age of 13 not to fill out a profile, and will instruct users under the age of 13 to choose a username that does not contain the user's name or other identifyable information.  In addition, users under the age of 13 are instructed not to use any personally
identifyable information in any public review or message board posting. Users
under 13 may fully participate in this web service if they receive permission from their parents,  and the parent(s) send an e-mail to sharifi@cc.gatech.edu  that states that they have read this privacy policy and give permission for
their child to use the service.  If a user under the age of 13 fills out a profile despite instructions not to, the information stored in the profile will be removed. 
<br><br>


<b>What information we collect:</b>
<br><br>
Upon registration, rateyourmusic.com asks users who would like to register, 
and are over 13 years of age, to fill out a short profile.  The profile is an optional step of  registration.  The following information is collected from registration and profiles:
<br><br>
Username and Password<br>
First and Last Name<br>
Age<br>
Sex<br>
Location<br>
Zip Code<br>
E-Mail Address<br>
Personal homepage<br>
Favorite Musical Artist/Bands<br>
Any other comments the user wishes to make about him/herself
<br><br>
Users can put anything in the location field that they wish. 
<br><br>
In addition, registered users may add albums to their collection, give the
album a rating, write reviews or biographies, and make public postings on message boards/forums.
<br><br>


<b>What information other users of the website can see:</b>
<br><br>
If the user provides this information, other users can see 
his/her username, name, age, sex, the text that the user typed in the location
field,  homepage, favorite bands and artists, and other comments. In 
addition, other users will be able to see the albums that are part of the
user's lists, as well as the ratings and reviews of those albums. 
<br><br>
The user's e-mail address is visible to other  users if they wish 
to share it by checking the box that says 
"Check here if you would like your e-mail address to be visible to
 other users of this site." , which is unchecked by default.
<br><br>
The user's zip code is NOT visible to other users.
<br><br>


<b>What we do with this information:</b>
<br><br>
rateyourmusic.com allows users to provide this personal information
so that the other users can learn more about them.
<br><br>
rateyourmusic.com does not use your name, the text typed in the location field, homepage, favorite bands, and other comments in any way other than to display them to other users. 
<br><br>
rateyourmusic.com ONLY uses e-mail addresses to mail the user's password
back to them if they request this service, and to allow other users to contact the user.
<br><br>

rateyourmusic.com will eventually use the sex, age, and zip code
of users to display aggregate statistics to users.  For example, when
choosing an album, we would like to tell you what percentage of males
and females gave it a high rating, what the average age of the owners of the
album is, and what areas of the United States the album is popular in. 
<br><br>

rateyourmusic.com does not and will not sell information about you to
third parties.  If rateyourmusic provides a link to another web site, and
that web site asks for personally identifyable information, this information
is not shared with rateyourmusic.

<br><br>
rateyourmusic.com uses cookies.  We use cookies to allow the user to stay logged in while he/she uses the service.  In addition, we keep track of the last time the user visited, so that we may alert a user of new services/features since his/her last visit, as well as to find out how many
