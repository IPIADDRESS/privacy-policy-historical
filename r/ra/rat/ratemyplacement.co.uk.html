					<h2><b>What is a privacy policy and why is it important for you?</b></h2>
<p>A privacy policy is a statement that shows some or all of the ways we, RateMyPlacement.co.uk, use, disclose, and manage your data. We have a legal requirement to protect your privacy and that’s exactly what we intend to do.</p>
<p>We know that you care about how your information is used and shared and we appreciate your trust in us to do that carefully and sensibly.</p>
<p>At RateMyPlacement we use your data to help you find the best work experience opportunities for you. That is why we collect your data so we can:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Provide you with a personalised experience</strong>
<ul>
<li>Shortlisting and favoriting companies means that you can then hear from them directly about new roles and what it’s like to work at the company.</li>
<li>We use cookies to help us to personalise your experience and interactions with us. This means we can see your behaviours on the website and then advertise the best opportunities for you as well as improve your user experience with us.</li>
<li>If you have looked at a particular employer on our website, we then use this information to advertise to you on your social media platforms and other websites so that you can keep that particular employer in mind.</li>

<h2><b>Your rights and responsibilities</b></h2>

<h2><b>Information we collect</b></h2>

<h2><b>How we collect your information</b></h2>

<h2><b>How is your data collected</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>When you sign up through the RateMyPlacement.co.uk login page</li>
<li>Through several touch points on the website including redundant pages, leaving the website to visit third party page, through shortlisting and favouriting job roles and companies.</li>
<li>Careers and freshers fairs we use forms to collect your data to set up an account</li>

<li>Follow Companies, denoted by a thumb icon.</li>
<li>Shortlist Jobs, denoted by a heart icon.</li>
<li>Favourite Reviews, denoted by a star icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a user first performs one of these actions for a company we ask for consent to share their data with the employer they shortlist, follow or favourite. For example, a user shortlists a job for Company A, they are then shown a question asking whether they would like to share their data directly with Company A.</li>
<li>If a user makes no choice when asked this question, their data will not be shared.</li>
<li>If a user declines to opt in, that preference will be saved and they will not be asked again for that company. Their data will not be shared. This preference can be changed at a later date.</li>
<li>If a user opts in to share their data with employers, the following information will be passed to all the employer that the user shortlists, follows or favourites.
<ul>
<li>First name</li>
<li>Surname</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Course</li>
<li>University</li>
<li>Graduation Year</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>The action they performed. e.g. shortlisting a job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If at a later date a user would like to stop sharing their data with employers, they can change their opt in preference in the my account section of RateMyPlacement.</li>
<li>Once the information has been passed to a third party employer, the users relation with regards to the data shared is with the third party employer.</li>
<li>If the user would like to remove or amend the shared data they should contact the third party employer directly.</li>
</ul>
