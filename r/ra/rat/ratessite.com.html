	<span class="SubHead">Use of Cookies</span><br>
	<br>
	The RatesSite.com Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your 
	online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk 
	by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver 
	viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only 
	be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
	<br>
	One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature 
	to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you 
	have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize 
	RatesSite.com pages, or register with RatesSite.com site or services, a 
	cookie helps RatesSite.com to recall your specific information on 
	subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal 
	information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When 
	you return to the same RatesSite.com Web site, the information you 
	previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
	RatesSite.com features that you customized.<br>
	<br>
	You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
	automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
	setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, 
	you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the 
	RatesSite.com services or Web sites you visit.<br>
	<br>

	use or disclosure. RatesSite.com secures the personally identifiable 
	information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure 
	environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When

	Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="SubHead">Changes to this Statement</span><br>
	<br>
