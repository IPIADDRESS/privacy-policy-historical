		<h2>Our Privacy Pledge</h2>
<p>RateSupermarket.ca&nbsp;owned and operated by Kanetix Ltd., believes in protecting the personal information that you provide us at www.ratesupermarket.ca. We have made safe computing and the protection of your privacy an important priority.</p>
<p>RateSupermarket.ca provides mortgage rates, credit card comparisons, banking rates and insurance quotes with minimal personal information. Except where mandated by the government and its regulatory bodies or the courts, the personal information that you share with us will not be shared with third parties without your prior consent.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Entering personal data on RateSupermarket.ca is not only easy but also safe. RateSupermarket.ca uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol, among the best Internet security software in the world, and DigiCert Inc. for securing the exchange of confidential data. This security technology encrypts the personal information that you send us (including things like names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers), so it cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. We will evaluate and adopt new security technology as it becomes available.<br><br>You can find out when the secure SSL connection is activated by looking for the key or padlock icon in the lower corner of your browser window. If the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, this indicates that the browser is now in "secure" mode.<br><br>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at customercare(at)ratesupermarket.ca.</p>

We use this information to optimize our website and improve the visitor experience.<br><br>We use both session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
