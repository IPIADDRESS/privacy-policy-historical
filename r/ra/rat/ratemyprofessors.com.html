							<p align="JUSTIFY">
							If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out 
							(which we may sometimes refer to as "<u>unsubscribe</u>") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. <br><br>
							The Site qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the 
							third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. <br><br>
							If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:info@ratemyprofessors.com"><b>info@ratemyprofessors.com</b></a>,

							<b>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities:  </b>The Site and/or RMP may provide its valued website users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from the Site and RMP, either by registering on this Site or via their wireless device.  
							Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for RMP.  The information requested as part of the online registration process ma include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name.  Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.  Depending on the Promotion, we may also 
							collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to the Site's Privacy Policy and Agreement. <br><br>
							We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.<br><br>
							Users that register for the Site's and/or RMP's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<b> </b>be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from the Site and/or RMP.  Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.  <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, RMP, its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's 
							wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</b> <br><br>
							<b>a.  Registration </b><br>
							To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for the Site's wireless marketing services.     Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in (Site/SMS)" method, at the discretion of the Site depending on the type of Promotion.  Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.<br><br>
