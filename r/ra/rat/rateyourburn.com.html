</h2>
<br>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">

</p>
<br>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>1. Information we collect and how we use it.</b>
<br>
<br>
a. Information you provide to us:
<br>
<br>
When you register up for a member account to access and use the Website and the Services (“Membership Account”), we ask you for personal information. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Service. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
c. User communications
<br>
<br>

When you send and receive SMS messages we may collect and maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the content of the message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our services.
<br>
<br>
d. Access Device and Browser Information.
<br>
<br>
When you access the Website from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit. When you access the Website via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.
<br>
<br>
e. Cookie Information.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
f. Third Party Applications
<br>
<br>

In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and protect the rights or property of RYB or our users. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<br>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>2. Sharing information on the Website.</b>
<br>
<br>
a. User Names and Anonymity.
<br>
<br>
Upon registering for a Membership Account, you will be assigned a user name of your own choosing, but which does not contain your name, initials, or any other information which will reasonably allow other users to discern your identity on the Website (“User Name”).  Your User Name will be the sole means for others to identify you on the Website, and you will not disclose your identity including, but not limited to your name, initials, address and/or any other piece of information that could reasonably be used to discern your identity by any other user on the Website (“Identifying Information”).  Identifying Information should only be disclosed to RYB if specifically requested by RYB for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, the full version of which can be accessed through the following
<a href="/terms">link</a>
<br>
<br>
b.  Additional Information
<br>
<br>
Here are some other things to remember:
<br>
<br>
• Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users.
<br>
<br>
• Information might be re-shared or copied by other users.
<br>
<br>
• Once you submit your contact information or personal information, the information has been shared on the Internet and RYB cannot control who views the information.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>3. How We Use Your Information</b>
<br>
<br>
We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience.
<br>
We use the information we collect to provide our Services and features to you, to measure and improve those Services and features, including the Website, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Terms of Use. We also use a variety of systems to detect and address prohibited activity such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>4. How We Share Information</b>
<br>
<br>
We will share your information to respond to legal requests and to prevent harm, as well as for the purposes of complying with RYB’s DMCA Take-Down Policy, which can be accessed through the following link [INSERT LINK TO DMCA TAKE-DOWN POLICY HERE]. We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Use. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>5. How You Can Change or Remove Information</b>
<br>
<br>
a. Editing your profile.
<br>
<br>
You may change or remove your profile information at any time in your profile page. Information will be updated immediately.
<br>
<br>
b. Deactivating or deleting your account.
<br>
<br>
If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to the Website. If requested, we save your profile information (connections, photos, and Content etc.) so that in case you later decide to reactivate your account, you will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from the Website. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.
<br>
<br>
c. Limitations on removal.
<br>
<br>
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others or it was copied or stored by other users. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your information, they may retain your information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies. But they will no longer be able to access the information through the Website after you disconnect from them.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>6. Accessing and updating personal information</b>
<br>
<br>
When you use the Service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask members to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>7. How We Protect Information</b>
<br>
<br>
a. Steps we take to keep your information secure.
<br>
<br>
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to RYB employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
<br>
We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content, and may suspend or disable accounts for violations of our Terms of Use.
<br>
<br>
b. Risks inherent in sharing information.
<br>
<br>
Although we allow you limit access to your information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other members with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on the Website will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Website. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
<br>
<br>
c. Report Violations.
<br>
<br>
You should report any security violations to us as soon as you are aware of the violation.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</b>
<br>
<br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="sweepstake_rule">
<b>9. Enforcement</b>
<br>
<br>

RYB regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is RYB’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between RYB and an individual.
