<li>To send you e-mails, e-newsletters, personalized offers via direct messaging or other communications about our services, if you have subscribed to receive this information or you have not advised us that you do not wish to receive such communications;</li>
<li>To manage our Web Site, diagnose technical problems, improve content and allocate the resources of our systems so that your experience with our Web Site is as efficient as possible;</li>
<li>To process and track your transactions;</li>
<li>To send you information about our and our Affiliates' and Business Partners' products and services and other information and materials that may be of interest to you;</li>

<li>To evaluate credit standing and to match credit bureau or credit reporting agency information; to investigate, detect and protect RatesToGo and other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, fraud, theft and other illegal activities; in performing these evaluations, personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered credit agency which may keep a record of that information.</li>

We may use aggregated information to describe our User base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other Users of our Web Site.

<h2>5. To whom we disclose Personal Information</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may disclose your Personal Information as follows:</p>
<li>To those hotels with which you make arrangements through our Web Site. We provide them with the Personal Information needed to make and complete the booking or reservation;</li>
<li>To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of RatesToGo, for example to provide customer service, process credit cards, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Web Site, to facilitate usage by a User, or to offer credit card services or evaluate your creditworthiness. We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside Australia. Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to RatesToGo, and under the instructions of RatesToGo, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy; </li>
<li>By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer, storing and processing of your Personal Information outside Australia to other companies in our group or to third parties who will provide you with a product or service to help us provide our services to you;</li>
<li>We may collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions. We will share Personal Information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested.</li>
<p>This policy does not cover the use of your Personal Information by these other companies. We encourage you to read a company's privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services.</p>

<li>To effect a corporate transaction, in connection with the sale, merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization of our corporation, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in regular course of business; and</li>
<li>To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</li>
<h3>Disclosure without consent</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where RatesToGo may be obligated to disclose information without consent.</strong></span></p>
<p>Such circumstances may include:</p>
<li>If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules or court relating to the production of records. If we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to contact you about it, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration, before we respond to that request. If you have not registered with us, we will attempt to contact you on the details you have provided in your transactions with us.</li>
<li>If a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</li>
<li>To a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an identifiable person or group.</li>
<li>Where it is necessary to collect monies owing to us.</li>
<h2><a name="PP_06"></a>6. How we retain and store Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes for which your Personal Information was collected – this may include ensuring that we have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or where a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by RatesToGo, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in <a href="#PP_07">How we protect Personal Information</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="PP_07"></a>7. How we protect Personal Information</h2>
<p>RatesToGo employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you choose to contact RatesToGo through the Web Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. RatesToGo assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking or reservation on the Web Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>
<p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>
<p>While being transmitted over the Internet, your credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Credit card details are only used to pay for accommodation related costs booked through our service. These details are stored securely at all times, are not used for any other purpose and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties.</p>
<h2><a name="PP_08"></a>8. How to access or correct your Personal Information</h2>
<p>We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. If you are a Member, we encourage you to visit your member profile tab to review your Personal Information. All Users of the Web Site may request access to, update of correct Personal Information we hold about them by emailing us at privacy@RatesToGo.com.</p>
<p>At any time, RatesToGo Members can view and/or update all the Personal Information in their member profile. To do so, login on the <a href="https://www.ratestogo.com/account/myprofile">Membership Homepage</a> and click on "My Account" to view and/or make the required changes. Should you wish to cancel your membership with RatesToGo, simply notify us by sending an email to our Customer Service Centre.</p>
<p>If you request that we remove all of the Personal Information or travel records stored in “My Account”, we will promptly do so. Once required Personal Information is removed, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Web Site to Members, unless you re-register.</p>
<p>Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain that information, or for other reasons as described in ‘<a href="#PP_06">How we retain and store your Personal Information</a>’.</p>
<h2>9. Privacy</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A Cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Web Site. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the user's browser, but not necessarily the user. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.</p>
<p>When you access our Web Site, our computer may seek to place "cookies" or "pixel tags" on your personal computer to collect Session Data. Cookies and pixel tags are used for the purpose of helping us to recognize you when you visit our Web Site again and to help us customize your online experience. Unless a user specifically informs us of his/her identity (e.g. by registering with us), we will not know who the individual user is.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Web Sites you visit. You can learn more about the use of cookies by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org">http://networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Third Parties and Advertising</h3>
<p>Third parties advertise on our Web Site, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our Business Partners believe you may be interested. While we may share Session Data with third parties to help facilitate the serving of these ads, we do not share any Personal Information about you unless you give us permission to do so, separate from any permission you provide during the Member registration process. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Web Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Web Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>When you click on a third party's link from our Web Site, you will leave our Web Site and will enter that third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites.

However, should you choose to not receive them in the future, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from the mail database by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.</p>

<p>RatesToGo may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through the Web Site, or through telephone or email communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that RatesToGo deems inappropriate or in violation of these Terms and Conditions. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>For your convenience, our Web Site provides links to other web sites. When you click on one of these links, you are leaving our Web Site and entering another web site. We are not responsible for such third party web sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other web sites you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to such other web sites.</p>
