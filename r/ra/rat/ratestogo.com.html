Most Internet browsers automatically accept Cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting Cookies or prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the Web Sites you visit.<br>
<br>
If you decide not to accept our Cookies, you will be able to access those parts of our Web Site that are available to the general public, but you may not be able to access many of the Products and Services offered at our Web Site.</p><p>Additionally, we receive certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. We also deliver advertisements and provide website analytics tools on non-HotelClub websites and services, and we collect information such as page views on these third party sites as well.</p><p>When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from HotelCub, we may use customised links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you with more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p><p><strong>3. How we use personal information</strong></p><p>We use personal information to:</p><p>· provide you with the Products or Services;</p><p>· assist in arrangements and reservations with suppliers in relation to the provision of a Product or Service;</p><p>· send you information about our Products or Services that may be of interest to you, including those of our Affiliates and Business partners;</p><p>· process and track your transactions;</p><p>· collect and process payments, through us or a third party;</p><p>· facilitate your participation in our membership program;</p><p>· conduct competitions or promotions on behalf of HotelClub and selected third parties;</p><p>· develop, enhance, market, sell or provide our Products or Services, or those of companies with which we have a commercial relationship, but only if you have granted us permission to do so or we are otherwise able to do so under applicable law;</p><p>· perform all other administrative and operational tasks (including risk management, systems development and testing, staff training, and market or customer satisfaction research);</p><p>· verify your identity;</p><p>· communicate with you by email, mail or telephone;</p><p>· analyse and manage the use of our Web Site;</p><p>· personalize the service we provide to you, tailor your experience at our Web Site to your interests and make more appropriate travel recommendations;</p><p>· investigate, detect and protect HotelClub against error, negligence, breach of contract, fraud, theft and other illegal activities;</p><p>· effect a corporate transaction in connection with the sale, merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization of our corporation, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in the regular course of business;</p><p>· as otherwise permitted by law; or</p><p>· for any other purpose to which you consent.</p><p><strong>Use of Aggregated Information and Session Data</strong></p><p>We also use aggregated information (which is information recorded in any form about more than one individual) where the identity of the individual is not known and cannot be inferred from the information. We may use aggregated information to describe our User base to current or potential partners, investors and advertisers; after a survey, to understand and respond to market needs and preferences; or to make recommendations to other Users of our Web Site. For example, if Users of our Web Site who have travelled to a particular destination told us that they had positive experiences at a hotel in that destination, we might recommend that hotel.</p><p>We work with third parties to serve ads on our Web Site and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use Cookies and Pixel Tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some third-party ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our Web Site with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share any personal information with any of our ad server partners, media partners or ad networks without your authorization.<br>
<br>
We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our Web Site and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. For example, we may serve a hotel’s ad to you while you are on another site, on behalf of that hotel. In such cases, we use a third-party called AppNexus to anonymously identify your browser while on another site. If you wish to opt-out of this kind of advertising, you can either delete cookies on your browser from adnx.com or you can click on the following link <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. None of our ad programs include any of your personal information. By opting out of AppNexus you may still receive ads from HotelClub or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p><p><strong>4. Our disclosure of personal information</strong></p><p>From time to time, we may disclose your personal information as follows:</p><p>· To suppliers of our Products or Services, such as hotels and accommodation service providers;</p><p>· To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of HotelClub, for example to provide customer service, process credit cards, submit e-mail communications to you on our behalf, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Web Site, to facilitate usage by a User, or to offer credit card services or evaluate your creditworthiness. We will share with these companies only that personal information which they need to work on our behalf.</p><p>· To collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions. If you request these Products and Services, we will share personal information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of your personal information by these other companies. We encourage you to read a company’s privacy policy before requesting any of its products or services;</p><p>· To protect our Web Site and our rights under our <a href="https://www.hotelclub.com/TermsOfUse.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>;</p><p>· To protect the rights or property of HotelClub, including the enforcement of our agreements or polices governing your use of the Products or Services or where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain;</p><p>· To effect a corporate transaction, in connection with the sale, merger, spin-off or other corporate reorganization of our corporation, where the information is provided to the new controlling entity in regular course of business; and</p><p>· To our insurers and to regulatory agencies.</p><p>We may disclose your personal information for a secondary purpose with your consent or if the disclosure is required by or authorised by law or a court/tribunal order.</p><p><strong>Cross-border disclosure of personal information</strong></p><p>Some of the third party service providers to whom we disclose your personal information may be located in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and India. Your personal information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to HotelClub, and under the instructions of HotelClub, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the APPs, this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p><p>Your personal information may also be disclosed to HotelClub’s related bodies corporate who are located in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Hong Kong, Singapore and China.

How we retain and store personal information</strong></p><p>We retain your personal information in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes for which your personal information was collected – this may include ensuring that we have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or where a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p><p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by HotelClub, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers.</p><p><strong>6.

HotelClub takes reasonable steps to ensure that third parties overseas protect all personal information in a manner consistent with the APPs and this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>7.
