You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to <a href="/index.php" title=" Rap Models">RapModels.net</a>. Do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of <a href="/index.php" title=" Rap Models">RapModels.net</a>'s features.
<br>
<br>
<b>Information from Other Sources</b>
