<center><b>Rapid Response.COM<br> </b><h2><b> PRIVACY POLICY</b></h2></center>
Welcome to Rapid Response.com (the "Site").<br> <br>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. <br> This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without <br>transacting
business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and
make use of the various services offered by Rapid Response.com
(collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").<br>
<br><b>"Personally Identifiable Information"</b> <br> refers to any
information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or
locate the person to whom such information pertains, including, but not
limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address,
financial profiles, social security number, and credit card
information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include
information that is collected anonymously (that is, without
identification of the individual user) <br> or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.<br><br>
<b>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? </b><br>We
may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We
collect the following additional information from our Authorized
Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of
Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the
nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized
Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
<br>
<b>What organizations are collecting the information? </b><br>In
addition to our direct collection of information, our third party
service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and
banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow
services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized
Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such
information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal
information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers.
Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as
links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the
information given to them.<br>
<br>
<b>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to
make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling
requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers
about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or
information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use
Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized
Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested
information.
<br>
<br><b>With whom may the information may be shared?</b><br> Personally
Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with
other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential transactions
with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated information
about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and
Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party
vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving
information or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our
behalf.
<br>
<br><b>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</b><br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by Rapid Response.com
is securely stored and is not accessible to third parties or employees
of Rapid Response.com except for use as indicated above.  <img src="rrrbprivacy_files/example_traffic_module.htm" alt="TrafficAgentServer 1.01 " border="0" height="1" width="1"><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?</b><br>
Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited
information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and
affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by
contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rapidresponsebot.com">privacy@Rapid Response.com</a><br><br>
<br>
<b>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</b><br> Cookies are used for a variety
of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences
of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies for
security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if
an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more
than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off.<br>
<br>
<b>How does Rapid Response.com use login information? </b><br>Rapid Response.com
uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses,
ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track
a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic information.<br>
<br><b>What partners or service providers have access to Personally
Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on
the Site?</b><br> Rapid Response.com has entered into and will
continue to enter into partnerships and other affiliations with a
number of vendors.<br>Such vendors may have access to certain
Personally Identifiable Information on a need to know basis for
evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility. <br>Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this information.
<br>
Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law.
We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply
with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement
agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally
Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the
safety of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.
<br>
<br><b>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</b><br>
All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and
practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and
Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of
qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access to
the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a
regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or
social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place
to protect information sent over the Internet. While we take
commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic
communications and databases are subject to errors, tampering and
break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not
take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized
Customers for any such occurrences.
<br>
<br><b>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally
Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by
emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rapidresponsebot.com">privacy@Rapid Response.com</a>
<br>
<br><b>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?</b><br>
We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to
delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's
database by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@rapidresponsebot.com">privacy@Rapid Response.com</a>.
However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be
impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual
information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable
Information deactivated will have this information functionally
deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable
Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
<br>
<br><b>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</b><br> We will let
our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy
policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we are changing
our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure of
Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized
Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact
such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized
Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>

Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are moving
to another web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of
