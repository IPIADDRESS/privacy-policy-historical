      800media.com and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to 
      protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining 
      our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. 
      <p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b><br>
        800media.com maintains the confidentiality, security and integrity of 
        personal information that we obtain from our users. We do not disclose 
        personal information to any party beyond the 800Media network. 800media.com 
        will periodically e-mail special offers pertaining to sites within the 
        800Media network. Users may opt-out of receiving these mailings; see the 
        Stop Receiving Mail section below. Our site may use order forms and registration 
        forms for users to request information, products, and services. We may 
        collect contact information (like users' email addresses, names, telephone 
        numbers and mailing addresses) and financial information (like account 
        or credit card numbers) through these forms. Contact information from 
        the forms is used to send orders to our customers, to send information 
        about our products and services and for the purposes of record keeping. 
        Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Stop Receiving 
        Mail section below. Financial information that is collected is used to 
        bill the user for products and services. Our online surveys and contests 
        sometimes ask users for contact information (like their email addresses) 
        or information about hobbies or interests. We sometimes use this information 
        to send news about our products and services and to help us provide our 
        customers with better service. Users may opt-out of receiving these mailings; 
        see the Stop Receiving Mail section below. We sometimes contact by telephone 
        users who have ordered products or services from us with information regarding 
        their order. </p>
      <p><b>About IP Addresses</b><br>
        800media.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration 
        and to report anonymous aggregate information to third parties. An IP 
        address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever 
        you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" 
        up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 
        When guests request pages from 800media.com, our servers log the users' 
        IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 
        This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains 
        anonymous to us. </p>
      <p><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
        Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's 
        hard drive for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is an industry 
        standard, you'll find them at most major Web sites. 800media.com sometimes 
        uses cookies to track certain information for our users' convenience and 
        to understand our customers better. </p>
      <p><b>Consumer Information</b><br>
        During the process of delivering an ad to you, 800media.com 
        does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such 
        as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, 800media.com
        does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such 
        as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your 
        browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh 
        or Windows, for example). The information collected by 
        800media.com is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring 
        ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.<br>

        You should be aware that when you are on 800media.com you could be directed 
        to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites 
        from our site that take you outside our service. These other sites may 
        send their own cookies to users, or otherwise collect data or solicit 
        personal information. Always be aware of where you end up on the Web. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Security</b><br>
        The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
        associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great 
        care in providing secure transmission of our users' financial information 
        from their computers to our servers, utilizing encryption software. Only 
        those employees who need access to our users' information in order to 
        do their jobs are allowed access. Any employee who violates our privacy 
        and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including 
        possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. </p>
