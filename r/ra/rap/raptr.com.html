        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Welcome to
        the <a href="http://raptr.com">raptr.com</a> website run by Raptr, Inc.
        (<strong>"Raptr,"
        "we," "us,"</strong> or <strong>"our"</strong>). Raptr
        is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users
        of our <a href="http://raptr.com">raptr.com</a> website (the <strong>"Site"</strong>) (we refer to
        the Site and the services we provide as described in our Site collectively
        as the <strong>"Raptr Features"</strong>). As such, we have established
        and implemented this privacy statement to inform visitors to the Site
        and users of the Raptr Features how we use and protect the information
        we collect. If you have any questions regarding this information or
        our privacy practices, please see the section entitled <strong>"Questions?
        Contact Us"</strong> at the end of this privacy statement. This privacy
        statement is effective as of 2/22/08.</p>

        <h3>What information does Raptr collect?</h3>
        <p>
          Raptr does not collect personally identifiable information unless
          our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. We do, however,
          collect certain types of information and ask for personal information
          in certain circumstances, such as when you set up an account. The
          following sections describe what type of information we collect,
          when we collect it and how we use it.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting up an account</h3>
        <p>In order to use certain functionality of the Raptr Features, you will have to create
        a user account which requires you to submit certain personal information.
        When you register and create an account, we require you to provide us
        your name and email address as well as a user name that you select.
        We also ask for certain information about yourself such as your age,
        birthdate, gender and interests. Upon activating an account, you will
        select a user name and password. Your user name and password will be
        used so you can securely access and maintain your account.</p>

        <h3>Viewing Web Pages</h3>
        <p>As with most web sites, your computer sends information that gets logged by a web
        server when you browse our Site. This typically includes your computer's
        IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web
        page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie"
        (which can be disabled using your browser preferences) to help the site
        remember your last visit. If you are logged in, this information is
        associated with your personal account. The information is also included
        in anonymous statistics to allow us to understand how visitors use our
        site.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>We may from time to time implement "cookies" or other features to allow
        us or third parties to collect or share information that will help us
        improve our Site and the Raptr Features we offer, or help us offer new
        services and features. A cookie is a small amount of data, that often
        includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to a user's browser
        from a Web server and stored on a user's computer hard drive. Usage
        of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information about you.
        You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings
        on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not
        be able to use the full functionality of our Site or the Raptr Features</p>

        <h3>Viewing and Downloading Content and Advertising</h3>
        <p>As with browsing
        web pages, when you watch content and advertising or download games
        and other software on our Site or through the Raptr Features, most of
        the same information is sent to us (including, IP Address, operating
        system, etc.); but, instead of page views, your computer sends us information
        on the content, advertisement or game viewed or installed by the Raptr
        Features and the website and time.  Additionally, the Raptr Features
        allow us to collect information regarding the games you have installed
        and uninstalled on your computer and what time you start and stop playing
        a game.</p>

        <h3>Community &amp; Support</h3>
        <p>We provide
        customer service support through email and feedback forms.  In order
        to provide customer support, we will ask for your email address. Aside
        from this information, we do not ask for any personal information to
        provide customer support. We only use information received from customer
        support requests, including email addresses, for customer support services
        and we do not transfer or share this information with any third parties.</p>

        <p>You can also
        post questions and answer other user questions in our community forums.
        Our forum and messaging services allow you to participate in our gaming
        community; to do so, we maintain information, such as your user ID,
        contact list, and status messages, including what game you are currently
        playing (if you explicitly choose to enable this option). In addition,
        these and similar services in the future may require us to maintain
        your User ID and password. </p>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>From time-to-time,
        we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these
        surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether
        or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include
        contact information (such as your email address), and demographic information
        (such as interests or age level). Survey information will be used for
        purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the
        Raptr Features and will not be transferred to third parties. </p>

        <h3>How do we n use the information you provide us?</h3>
        <p>As stated above,
        we use your personal information such as your name, user ID and email
        address to maintain your user account. We also will use your email address
        to contact you when we provide customer support and to inform you when
        another user has sent you a private message or posted a comment for
        you on the website.</p>
        <p>In addition,
        from time to time, we may also use your email address to send you information
        on updates to the Raptr Features, and unless you choose not to be included,
        to alert you to offerings from other companies that we are affiliated
        with. To opt out of receiving these emails, please see the section below
        titled <strong>"How do you opt out?"</strong> We will not ever sell
        your email address or send you offerings from companies that we are
        not affiliated with. </p>
        <p>We may also
        provide aggregated information about our visitors to outside parties
        from time to time. For further details, please see the section below
        titled <strong>"Does Raptr disclose the information it collects to outside
        parties?"</strong></p>

        <p>We may use the information we collect to tailor your experience through the Raptr
        Features by displaying content according to your interests and preferences,
        providing a faster method for you to access your account and submit
        information to us and allowing us to contact you, if necessary. </p>

        <h3>How does Raptr protect customer information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal
        information on our systems. User personal information is contained behind
        secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees
        who have special access rights to such systems. We continue to store
        your personal information for so long as it is necessary to provide
        you our service and currently do not anticipate destroying old personal
        information. In most cases, we will at a minimum keep one archival copy
        of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal
        processes.</p>

        <h3>Does Raptr disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outsideparties? </h3>
        <p>
          We will never sell or rent your email address or any of your personal information.

          your personal information as we believe is necessary to:

            validate the size and composition of the gaming audience, and understand
            its experience with the Raptr client and service. This may require,

            records showing which games were viewed by which IP addresses.
          </li>
