<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on

<h2>Where we store and process your personal data</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination inside or outside the European Economic
Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating inside or

support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to
this transfer, storing and/or processing. We will take all steps
reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us via email or Our Site is
stored on our secure servers or the secure servers of third parties

responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not
to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet
is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect

contact you about these. We and/or any third party that we permit
to use your data, will only contact you by electronic means to
provide you with information about goods and services which may be
of interest to you if you have consented to this.</p>

by us about you. Your right of access can be exercised in
accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee
of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the

to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think
