        There are times that Rap Basement may need to gather information about <br>
        you through our website. We gather such information to offer compelling <br>
        and easily accessible online content in a manner that provides personal <br>
        privacy protection as well. IP addresses are used by your computer every <br>
        time you are connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that <br>
        data (such as web pages you request) can be sent to you. We use your IP <br>
        address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our <br>
        Web site. We also use your IP address to help identify you and your shopping <br>
        cart and to gather broad demographic information. A "Cookie" is an element <br>
        of data that a website can send to your browser. Cookies are used to better <br>

        you purchase something through our site) and to make sure you don't see <br>
        the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to deliver content specific <br>

        the order form we collect visitor's contact information (like their e-mail <br>
        address) and financial information (like their account or credit card <br>
        numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, <br>
        information about our company, and promotional material from some of our <br>
