			<br>
			Last Updated: June 1st, 2010<br>
			<br>
			W3B Solutions Ltd strives to offer its visitors the many advantages 
			of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and 
			personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
			Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone 
			number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never 
			sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
			party. Period."<br>
			<br>
			How we gather information from users<br>
			<br>
			How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
			visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
			services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide 
			information when you register for access to certain portions of our 
			site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you 
			make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
			sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
			interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, W3B Solutions 
			Ltd also collects information automatically and through the use of 
			electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For 
			example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or 
			use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from 
			your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name 
			and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information 
			each time you visit, or may control the number of times you 
			encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we 
			adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through 
			other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with 
			information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept 
			cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions 
			of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, 
			and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to 
			your preferences.<br>
			<br>
			What we do with the information we collect<br>
			<br>
			Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your 
			visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We 
			respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
			<br>
			Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
			identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
			information about your usage patterns with similar information 
			obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services 
			(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
			most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared 
			with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
			does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you 
			or allow anyone to identify you individually.<br>
			<br>
			We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on W3B 
			Solutions Ltd to communicate with you about your registration and 
			customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; 
			services and products offered by W3B Solutions Ltd and other topics 
			we think you might find of interest. <br>
			<br>
			Personally Identifiable Information collected by W3B Solutions Ltd 
			may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to 
			site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce 
			transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
			communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical 
			support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for 
			example) may access such information. We will use your information 
			only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
			continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner 
			with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
			information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
			disclose your information in response to a court order, at other 
			times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in 
			connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or 
			to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or 
			necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to 
			disclosure in such cases.<br>
			<br>
			Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements<br>
			<br>
			W3B Solutions Ltd expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates 
			to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third 
			parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other 
			content providers accessible through our site, may have their own 
			privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
			during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a 
			frame on a W3B Solutions Ltd page, certain content that is actually 
			created or hosted by a third party. Also, through W3B Solutions Ltd 
			you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web 
			sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
			W3B Solutions Ltd is not responsible for the actions or policies of 
			such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies 
			of those third parties when providing information on a feature or 
			page operated by a third party.<br>
			<br>
			While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other 
			third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to 
			identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
			For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and 
			may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether 
			you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features 
			available on our site may offer services operated by third parties 
			and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. W3B 
			Solutions Ltd does not control the use of this technology by third 
			parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any 
			actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
			<br>
			You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
			Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that 
			information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by 
			third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited 
			messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities 
			are beyond the control of W3B Solutions Ltd and this policy.<br>
			<br>
			Children<br>
			<br>
			W3B Solutions Ltd does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 
			Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as 
			permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information 
			from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete 
			that information immediately. If you believe W3B Solutions Ltd has 
			any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at 
			the address listed below.<br>

			W3B Solutions Ltd reserves the right to change this policy at any 
			time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your 
			continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these

			solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to 
			binding arbitration at the following location: United Kingdom, under 
			the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the 
			award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with 
			jurisdiction to do so.<br>
