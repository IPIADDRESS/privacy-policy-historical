	<p>Effective date: October 9, 2007</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Rapleaf takes privacy very seriously. It is our number one priority. We are committed to keeping member and nonmember information safe and secure at any cost.</p>
<p>Our wholly-owned subsidiaries and business services are also committed to protecting and respecting privacy rights of clients and their users. This includes every email address about whom we either process information or maintain information within Rapleaf’s databases.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on how, when, and why Rapleaf collects, treats, and uses data from various means and should assist in understanding data security and privacy practices regarding data collection. And note that the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy apply to Rapleaf’s collection of member and client’s data and append on that data set. Please read this policy carefully and review it often because it may change.</p>
<p>NOTE: Rapleaf does not sell, rent, or lease email addresses to clients or third-party marketers.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Registration Information</strong></p>
<p>Users of our system must complete a registration process.  We will collect personally identifiable information during this process that includes email address (name is optional). We use this information to process registrations, contact our users, and to provide our services.</p>
<p><em>Usernames</em></p>
<p>During registration, members have the option of selecting a first and last name that will be publicly tied to their use of our system. We do not share first and last names together with an email address unless someone searches using a specific email address. Searching an email address will display the first and last name of a member if the email is linked to the member’s profile. If a member does not provide a first and last name, then an arbitrary username — which may be the first name and last name — will be used in place of the member’s first and last name.</p>
<p><em>Passwords</em></p>
<p>During registration, members must create a password. Passwords are used to secure member information and the integrity of the system. We only store a one-way encryption of member passwords which means passwords cannot be unencrypted by us. Our login page provides a way for members to obtain access to the system in case they lose or forget their password.</p>
<p><em>Optional Reputation Information</em></p>
<p>After an account is activated a member can choose to enter additional information, such as other email accounts. This information is completely voluntary and may be used to further establish a member’s reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Changing Preferences</strong></p>
<p>After signing in, members may access and change their registration information using the secondary navigation above member’s username.  Members may change their password, username, name, and any other communication preferences as set by our system. Members may access other information collected and processed about them and adjust the display settings.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Oneself to Rapleaf</strong></p>
<p>A member cannot automatically be registered with Rapleaf. The only exception to this rule is if a partner site integrates Rapleaf. All members of the partner site may automatically be registered in Rapleaf using the login credentials at the partner site.</p>
<p>Also, a person can be included in the system as a nonmember if searched by another user. Rapleaf may leave an appropriate rating to the nonmember as dictated by our reputation algorithm. NOTE – a nonmember email address searched in Rapleaf does not automatically register that particular email address.</p>
<p><strong>En Masse Information (TrustFuse Service)</strong></p>
<p>Part of Rapleaf’s business model is to help gather information for our clients and give them an opportunity to give their users a better user experience.   The en masse services work as follows:</p>
<p><em>Client Expectations</em></p>
<p>Rapleaf clients provide email address information on their users for Rapleaf to collect and append data. These email addresses are safeguarded and clients may provide additional security by disclosing only a one-way hash for the email addresses. Additionally, clients are not required to provide any supplemental user data to Rapleaf</p>
<p><em>Types of Information Collected</em></p>
<p><u>Personally identifiable information (PII)</u><br>
PII is information that allows Rapleaf to append client data. Rapleaf may collect or maintain the following PII about these users:</p>
<p>-Email address<br>
-Website username or screen name<br>
-First and last name<br>
-Physical address<br>
-Phone number</p>
<p><u>Non-PII</u><br>
Non-PII is information collected by Rapleaf in the normal course of operating its business that does not reveal the specific identity of a client’s user. Types of non-personally identifiable information collected include:</p>
<p>-Demographic<br>
-Psychographic/Interests<br>
-Friend map/network<br>
-Websites Used<br>
-Other social web data</p>
<p><em>Source of Information Collected</em></p>
<p><u>PII</u><br>
PII is collected from clients every time clients use the Rapleaf service. The information is then stored in Rapleaf’s secure database. PII is also collected from publicly available sources and indexed from these sources. These sources typically include sites where PII is available to view by the public.</p>
<p>Also, some PII data in Rapleaf database may be obtained from third-party services or internal, patent-pending algorithms or other mechanisms.</p>
<p><u>Non-PII</u><br>
Non-PII is collected from clients to supplement email address data, but only at client’s discretion when using the TrustFuse service. This information is also stored in Rapleaf’s secure database.</p>
<p>Most non-PII information or data is collected from publicly available sources. Such sources include social networking sites, commerce sites, e-tailers, government records, and other popular websites where user profile information is displayed and readily accessible.</p>
<p><em>Accuracy of Data</em></p>
<p>Rapleaf maintains the necessary procedures and does its utmost to ensure the quality and accuracy of the user data in its possession. As such, Rapleaf invites clients to access or update their users’ details as necessary. Rapleaf is committed to providing reasonable and practical access to allow clients the opportunity to identify and correct any inaccurate details we may hold. This can be done by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@rapleaf.com">privacy@rapleaf.com</a>.</p>
<p>Also, all clients have the right to access or update user data submitted to Rapleaf by contacting privacy@rapleaf.com</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Ratings</strong></p>
<p>Historical and statistical information is obtained from ratings submitted by members. The ratings have a qualitative component in the form of comment/feedback, as well as a quantitative component as a score or point value. We will also aggregate historical, statistical, and other reputation information across all member accounts, and we store this information.</p>
<p>Ratings are collected, surveyed, evaluated and scored by the system to assess the quality of comment/feedback. Along with our proprietary fraud system, we allow members to challenge comments made about them by emailing Rapleaf. This challenge process promotes the development of the most accurate member reputations.</p>
<p>Our system uses a Rapleaf score/point system as an input to Rapleaf’s scoring algorithms. A point balance will be maintained for each member and nonmember based upon the number and type of ratings on that particular individual. We may also use this information to add, adjust or discontinue certain services or functionality and to enforce our policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Members and nonmembers may receive ratings from Rapleaf from time to time. These ratings will be based on actions that were performed with respect to the member/nonmember’s account.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Aggregate Information</strong></p>
<p>We aggregate statistical, historical and other similar information about our members and non-members and their use of our system.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Other Information</strong></p>
<p>We store information that we collect automatically through cookies, clear gifs and/or log files. We use this information to create a profile of our members’ browsing preferences.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>Rapleaf uses session ID cookies to enhance the functionality of the service offered to clients and users and to make it easier for users to navigate our system. This cookie expires the browser is closed. We may also use persistent cookies to store members’ email and other information so it does not have to be re-entered when returning to the site. This cookie remains on a user’s hard drive for an extended period of time and can be removed by following directions provided by their Internet browser</p>
<p>In addition, Rapleaf will use cookies to indicate the number of computers used by each customer to log-in to the Rapleaf service, to prevent abuse of the system and logins.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience and functionality on our site.</p>
<p>Note, if users reject cookies they may still use our system, but their ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.</p>
<p><em>Log Files</em></p>
<p>We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, to control fraud, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Information Uses</strong></p>
<p>Rapleaf clients may use PII information of their users to further contact and communication with such users. Client may also use PII data to further append their database for marketing, fraud prevention, and authentication purposes.</p>
<p>Clients using non-PII can also append data onto their existing data. Typically non-PII data is used for targeted advertising, improved offerings, and better services.</p>
<p><strong>Wholly Owned Subsidiaries</strong></p>
<p><em>Upscoop</em></p>
<p>Rapleaf’s subsidiary product Upscoop is a social network mass lookup utility. With Upscoop, users can enter their email login credentials (applicable to only the major free webmail services), at which point Upscoop’s system will gather a user’s email address book, search all the major social networks for the email addresses within the email address book, and display results showing which address book contact is on what social network. The social networks displayed will be linked to the address book contact’s social network profile.</p>
<p>NOTE: Upscoop does not store email login credentials.</p>
<p>Information captured via Upscoop may be used to assist Rapleaf’s services. Additionally, information collected by Rapleaf during the course of its business may also be displayed on Upscoop for given email address book search results.</p>
