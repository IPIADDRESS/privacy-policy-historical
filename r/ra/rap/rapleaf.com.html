                      <p><strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>Who Should </strong><strong>Read This Statement</strong></p>
                      <p>The following privacy statement addresses potential questions, concerns, and/or interests of three different types of people or groups:</p>
                      <p>   1. Data Subjects: People with Rapleaf profiles.</p>
  <p>   2. Members: People who have signed-up with Rapleaf to manage their online reputations and privacy.</p>
  <p>   3. Customers: Organizations who take advantage of Rapleaf’s services to learn more about their users or consumers.
</p>
                      <p>A “data subject” is any person with a profile in Rapleaf’s database. Profiles are created when a member queries his or her own information, or a business customer provides Rapleaf with an email address. </p>
                      <p>Our “members” are people who have registered with us to use our innovative tools to enhance and control their online reputations and to control the profiles about themselves that we disclose to customers.</p>
                      <p>Rapleaf’s “customers” are organizations and companies seeking new ways to reach and/or learn more about their own users, subscribers, consumers, etc. We provide our customers with information on our data subjects to gain meaningful insights into their consumers and users for the purpose of improving and/or personalizing their own products and services.</p>
                      <p><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Personal and Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
                      <p>Rapleaf collects several types of personal and non-personal information either directly from you, as a member of our online services, from business customers, and/or from publicly available sources on the web. These can be described as follows:</p>
                      <p><em>Personal Information</em></p>
                      <p>We define “personal information” as information that can be used to uniquely identify you or that you may consider sensitive. Most of the information we index comes from openly available sources on the web, including forums, review sites, social networks, commerce sites, message boards, and other sites where individuals post information about themselves. We collect such information when you register and use our service as an individual member. We may also gather personal information about you from our business customers when they provide us with a list of their users’ email addresses to process.</p>
                      <p>The specific types of personal information that we collect include: email addresses, profile URLs, usernames or screen names, first and last names, addresses, and phone numbers. A profile URL is the specific web address to a person’s profile on a social networking site or commerce site, for example.</p>
                      <p>Our systems and database are structured around individual email addresses. Rapleaf’s members and business customers provide email addresses to use our products and services. We hold these email addresses in confidence and do not rent, sell, or lease these email addresses to third parties.</p>
                      <p><em>Non-Personal Information</em></p>
                      <p>Our definition of “non-personal information” is information related to you but that cannot be used to personally identify you. We obtain non-personal information about you when you provide it to us, either separately or together with your personal information, when you access our site. We may also obtain this information from other open web sites or when a business customer provides it to us.</p>
                      <p>We collect the following types of non-personal information: demographic (e.g., age, gender), psychographic (e.g., interests), and sociographic (e.g., social networking relationships, social networks used). This information also includes non-personal information that we gather as you navigate our website. We log this information when you visit and browse our website. We record details such as browser types, domains, statistics of your visit including page views, and time spent on the website. We use this information to improve our services for you and to our customers. </p>
                      <p>We do not knowingly collect information about your religion, finance, health, or sexual preference, nor do we knowingly collect information about children. We view these types of information as sensitive and understand they require additional protections under various laws. We encourage you to take extra precautions in posting sensitive personal information via openly available web sites, as this data could be used in ways you may not anticipate or desire. It is your responsibility to review web sites’ privacy policies and set the appropriate profile settings available to you before posting sensitive information online.</p>
                      <p><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Uses of Personal Information</strong></p>
                      <p>We use personal and non-personal information to provide our services to our members and customers as described below.</p>
                      <p><em>Uses of Information About Data Subjects</em></p>
                      <p>For people who have a profile in the Rapleaf database but who have not visited our site, your profile page is the result of having been the subject of a search initiated in the past by a Rapleaf member or business customer. We use the personal and non-personal information collected about you as a result of that search to respond to the initial search, as well as to respond to any future searches for business customers.</p>
                      <p>The value of having a Rapleaf profile is in its ability to aggregate your profiles on disparate web sites, control your information and privacy settings on these various sites, and control the information Rapleaf shares with its business customers. We encourage you to consider becoming a member. If, however, you are not interested in joining, then you can opt-out of Rapleaf. (See Your Choices and Privacy Preferences below for more information.)<br>
                          <br>
                      </p><p><em>Uses of Information About Members</em></p>
                      <p>You may choose to use our service to search your own email addresses to see what personal information is openly available about you online.</p>
                      <p>As a Rapleaf member who has completed the sign-up process, we use your personal and non-personal information to: (1) assist you in managing your online reputation; (2) communicate with you from time to time; and (3) track your use of our site.</p>
                      <p>When a customer initiates a search via Rapleaf based on your email address, we will display your membership profile. Results will include the specific personal and non-personal information you permit us to display within our system.  </p>
                      <p>We use your personal information to communicate with you as a member, primarily via your registered email address. We communicate with you in accordance with your preferences and in response to your inquiries, to provide requested services, and to help you manage your account. In addition, you may choose to receive emails when you are rated by others or subscribe to our newsletter. We provide you with ways to unsubscribe from any of the above communications. (See Your Choices and Privacy Preferences below for more information.)</p>
                      <p>As a member, we may email you about our services, including special alerts, service-related announcements, offers, awards, surveys, contests, promotions, and updates. We opt our members into receiving communications from us. You are always given the option to not receive future communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of any Rapleaf email.</p>
                      <p>We use non-personal information to track and monitor aggregate usage of our website and for internal analysis, quality control, and improvements to our service. We collect such information by using cookies and other standard web technologies. (See Log Files and Cookies below for more information.)</p>
                      <p><em>Information Uses About Customers</em></p>
                      <p>We collect, process, and provide personal and non-personal information to our business customers for use in enhancing their own products and services. Learning more about your interests, values, memberships, activities, and interactions online is increasingly relevant to maintaining the high-quality and personalized experience you value from the organizations, businesses, and technology providers you rely on today.</p>
                      <p>It is important to recognize that all kinds of organizations make use of online tools, sites, and resources to learn about you as an individual (i.e., user, customer, member, employee, merchant, student, voter). Our goal is to make this a cost-effective and practical process for our customers. By utilizing our pioneering and proprietary technology, these companies and organizations are now in a position to better understand their users and provide enhanced services.</p>
                      <p>Customers provide us with a list of email addresses to process. We search our database and open network sites for personal and non-personal information associated with these addresses and consolidate the results into profiles that can be used by our customers. Some examples of how our customers make use of our service include:</p>
                      <p><strong>·</strong> Improving communications with their users by crafting more relevant or timely messaging<br>
                        <strong>·</strong> Enhancing fraud prevention and authentication measures<br>
                        <strong>·</strong> Modifying their website’s user interface and controls<br>
                      </p><p>We ensure that information provided, processed, and reported to our customers is done so in a private and secure manner, and we actively work with our customers to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures they have set for privacy and security.</p>
                      <p><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>
                      <p>Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Rapleaf.

                      <p><em>Disclosure to Searched Sites</em></p>
                      <p>When we search for an email address provided by a member or business customer, our system first looks in our system to see what information we have associated with that address. For an email address not in our system, we search openly available web sites and create a profile page based on the results of those searches. As a result, web sites we search may cache or store that email address in their servers. Rapleaf assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection, and disclosure practices of any of these third party sites.</p>
                      <p><em>Disclosure to Commercial Partners </em></p>
                      <p>We may enter into commercial arrangements to enable partners to provide our service to their users and/or to provide you access to their products and services. As a result, we may share personal and non-personal information with these commercial partners. It is our policy to contractually limit sharing in these instances to only the information required to provide a service, provide notice, and we give you the opportunity to opt-out at any time.</p>
                      <p><em>Disclosure to Service Providers</em></p>
                      <p>We may use third party service providers for network, security, email, and hosting services for our system. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Rapleaf and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Rapleaf.</p>
                      <p><em>Links to Third Party Sites</em></p>
                      <p>We may provide links to third party websites not directly associated with Rapleaf. We do not provide these partnering sites with personal information on our members. We encourage you to review the privacy and security policies of any externally linked websites that may be accessed through our sites before you submit any personal information to them. Rapleaf assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection, and disclosure practices of any of these third party sites.</p>
                      <p><em>Disclosure Required By Law</em></p>
                      <p>Under certain circumstances personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information you have provided to us in advance unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.</p>
