<p><strong>4.3 Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Rapaport Customers</strong></p>

We disclose information we collect in response to a law enforcement request, subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.</p>
<p>We disclose information we collect in circumstances in which Rapaport believes the Services are being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety or security of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Rapaport, the Services or our subsidiaries, or affiliates in the Rapaport Group, or for us to render the Services provided. We disclose information we collect to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</p>
<p>Where permissible according to applicable law, we may use certain limited personal information about you, such as your email address, to hash it and to share it with social media or advertising platforms, such as Facebook or Google, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise promote our Services. These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you and others products or services that may be in your or their interest.</p>
<p>The social media platforms with which we may share your personal data are not controlled or supervised by Rapaport and they are considered data processors.</p>

<p>We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our clients have addresses in New York. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information. We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.</p>
<p>We share your information with third party companies that perform services on our behalf, including payment and subscription processing, order fulfillment, data analysis, marketing services, e-mail campaigns, hosting services, and customer service. While providing services for us, these companies act as Data Processors and may access your personal information, and are required to use it solely as directed by us for the purpose of our requested service.

We only share the minimum data needed for Data Processors to perform the services for which they are contracted.</p>

We also send messages about how to use the Services, network updates, reminders and promotional messages from us. Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from us, including security and legal notices, as doing so would prevent us from providing the Services to you. We use your information to contact you given our legitimate interest in providing the Services.</p>
<p>We also enable communications between you and others through our Services, including for example Rapaport Inbox.</p>
<p><strong>4.5 Your Use of Information and Our Services</strong></p>

In such circumstances, as a member you may have access to the member information, email address or other contact or shipping information of other members. By consenting to the applicable License Agreement, you agree that you will not share Rapaport access logins and you will only use this information for: (a) Rapaport-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through Rapaport (e.g. diamond sales, shipping or insurance), and (c) any other purpose that such client expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s). In all cases, you must provide clients with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another Rapaport client to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other client after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access.</p>

We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy. To report Rapaport-related spam, please send an email to: info@diamonds.net.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>YOUR CHOICES &amp; OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.1 Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We will store your data until such time when you request us to delete it. In some cases you may need to close your Account with us in addition to requesting data deletion. All other data will be retained for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may also retain information as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Any requests relating to the following rights should be sent to privacy@diamonds.net</p>
<p>Delete Data: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your personal data if it is no longer necessary to provide Services to you.</p>
<p>Change or Correct Data: You can edit some of your personal data through your account. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.</p>
<p>Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your personal data (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your personal data is inaccurate or unlawfully held).</p>
<p>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data: You can ask us for a copy of your personal data and can ask for a copy of personal data you provided in machine readable form.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Account Closure</strong></p>
<p>We keep some of your data even after you close your account.</p>
<p>If you choose to close your account, your personal data will generally stop being visible to others on our Services within 24 hours. We generally remove diamond information and profiles within 24 hours of account closure and this information will no longer be visible to clients of the Services.</p>
<p>We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our License Agreements, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.</p>
<p>Information you have shared with others (e.g., through Inbox, emails, posts etc…) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Lawful Bases for Processing</strong></p>
<p>We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and legitimate interests.</p>
<p>Where we rely on your consent to process personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer (privacy@diamonds.net).</p>
<p><strong>6 Information Security</strong></p>
<p>6.1 Rapaport is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to safeguard your nonpublic personal information.</p>
<p>6.2 The security of your subscription to any of the Services also relies on your protection of your password. You may not share your password with anyone. Rapaport will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the website.</p>
<p>6.3 Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to Rapaport immediately. If you do share your Rapaport password with a third party for any reason, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please contact us immediately on <a href="mailto:help@diamonds.net">help@diamonds.net</a>.</p>
