        <h2><strong><span class="paragraph">RapNet Privacy Policy</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="paragraph">Updated - November 5, 2012</span></p>
<p><strong>1 &nbsp; Overview</strong></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">1.1 &nbsp; The Rapaport Group of Companies (any company owned at least 51% by Martin Rapaport or any trust settled by Martin Rapaport) ("Rapaport" or "we") offers information and trading services ("the Services") through, amongst others, its Rapaport.com, Rapnet.com Diamonds.Net, and RapaportAuctions.com websites. In order to operate the Services and to be in compliance with United States laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT and OFAC requirements, Rapaport may ask you to provide us with company, personal, credit card and/or bank account details. This Privacy Policy applies to all Rapaport websites and Services and describes the information we collect and how we use that information.</span><br><span class="paragraph">1.2 &nbsp; Rapaport takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Paragraph 3 below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the Diamonds.Net, Rapaport.com, Rapnet.com, RapaportAuctions.com, RapaportFairTrade.com and other Rapaport websites, whether the services are offered by Rapaport, by its subsidiaries, or by its affiliates in the Rapaport Group.</span><br><span class="paragraph">1.3 &nbsp; By using this website and the Services, you agree to accept the provisions of this Privacy Policy. By applying for any of the Services offered through this website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy forms a part of and is incorporated into the terms of the RapNet Member License Agreement.</span><br><span class="paragraph">1.4 &nbsp; Please note that your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States, in accordance with United States laws. Rapaport will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment. If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the Services.</span></p>
<div class="gray-divider"></div>
<p><strong>2 &nbsp; Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">2.1 &nbsp; This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Services or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only 30 days after we post an amended Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">2.2 &nbsp; We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

<p><span class="paragraph">In order to protect us and our customers against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. This may include background and credit check from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Rapaport, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business and / or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process or for any reason whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">3.4 &nbsp; Additional Verification</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">If we cannot verify the information that you provide we may ask you to send us additional information (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">3.5 &nbsp; Web Site Traffic Information</span></p>

<div class="gray-divider"></div>
<p><strong>4 &nbsp; Our Use and Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.1 &nbsp; Internal Uses</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States. We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive special trading privileges or products and 4) to improve our products and services. We will not use any personal identification information without your permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.2 &nbsp; Disclosure to Other Rapaport Customers</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">If you are a registered Rapaport customer, your name, Company name, telephone numbers and e-mail address and other personal information in addition to the diamonds you are listing for sale may be displayed to other Rapaport customers in diamond listings or in a member directory. Should you be expelled or excluded as a member/customer, your name and member details may be posted online... However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone except with your express written permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.3 &nbsp; Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Rapaport Customers</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Rapaport will not sell, rent or share any of your personally identifiable information to third parties, except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission (or with other Rapaport customers as described above). We disclose information we collect in response to a law enforcement request, subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">We disclose information we collect in circumstances in which Rapaport believes the Services are being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Rapaport, the Services or our subsidiaries, or affiliates in the Rapaport Group, or for us to render the Services provided. We disclose information we collect to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users have addresses in New York. However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information. We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.4 &nbsp; Our Contacts with Rapaport Customers</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone or letter. We use your e-mail to send information, transaction confirmations and to send notices and other notices.. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional. We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications which you may opt out of.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.5 &nbsp; Internet Address Information</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">4.6 &nbsp; Your Use of Information and Our Services</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">In order to facilitate the transactions between Rapaport members, our Service allows you limited access to other users' contact or shipping information. As a member, you may have access to the member information, email address or other contact or shipping information of other members. By consenting to the applicable Terms of Service, you agree that you will not share Rapaport access logins and you will only use this information for: (a) Rapaport-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through Rapaport (e.g. diamond sales, shipping or insurance), and (c) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s). In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another Rapaport user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access. Rapaport does not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you may not add a Rapaport user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure, even if said user has previously made a purchase from you. We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy. To report Rapaport-related spam, please send an email to: info@diamonds.net.</span></p>
<div class="gray-divider"></div>
<p><strong>5 &nbsp; Information Security</strong></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">5.1 &nbsp; Rapaport is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">5.2 &nbsp; The security of your subscription to any of the Services also relies on your protection of your password. You may not share your password with anyone. Rapaport will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the website.</span></p>
<p><span class="paragraph">5.3 &nbsp; Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to Rapaport immediately. If you do share your Rapaport password with a third party for any reason, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please contact us immediately on help@diamonds.net.</span></p>
