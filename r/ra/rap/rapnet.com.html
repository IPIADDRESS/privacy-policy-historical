								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.1</span> The Diamonds.Net website offers free as
								well as subscriber/membership based services (“the Services”). In order to operate
								the Services and to be in compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT, Rapaport USA Inc.
								(“Rapaport” or “we”) may ask you to provide us with company, personal, credit card
								and/or bank account details. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect
								and how we use that information.
								<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.2</span> Rapaport takes the privacy of your personal
								information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with
								the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable
								information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in
								more detail in Paragraph 3 below, there are limited circumstances in which some
								of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions,
								so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies
								to all services that are hosted on the Diamonds.Net Web site, whether the services
								are offered by Rapaport, by its subsidiaries, or by its affiliates in the Rapaport
								Group.<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.3</span> By using the Diamonds.Net website, you agree
								to accept the Privacy Policy and Diamonds.Net Terms of Use . By applying for any
								of the subscription or membership based services offered through the Diamonds.Net
								website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information
								in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated
								into the terms of the <a href="TOS.aspx">Diamonds.Net Terms of Use.</a><br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.4</span> Please note that your personal information
								will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States , in accordance
								with United States laws. Rapaport will hold and transmit your personal information
								in a safe, confidential and secure environment. If you object to your personal information
								being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register
								for the Services.<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.5 Notification of Changes </span>
								<ul>
									<li>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Services or
										as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose
										your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that
										stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether
										or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes
										will be effective only 30 days after we post an amended Privacy Policy.</li>
									<li>We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our Web site so that you
										can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information,
										and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the Diamonds.Net Web site
										at www.Diamonds.net at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.</li></ul>

								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.6</span> Diamonds.Net Web site may include links
								to third party Web sites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements,
								and Rapaport is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited
								to their information practices. Users submitting information to or through these

							<span class="TOSHeading">Information We Collect</span> <a name="information"></a>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.1 Required Information </span>
							<ul>
								<li>To subscribe to the Services, you must provide company details, address, phone number,
									and e-mail address. In order to trade through our INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange
									or RapNet trading systems, you must provide trade references, credit card, debit
									card and bank account information. This required information is necessary for us
									to approve your membership and to process transactions or to contact you should
									the need arise in administering your membership. </li>
								<li>For USA PATRIOT ACT purposes we are required to collect your Employee Identification
									Number (“EIN”) or other Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”). If you choose to
									register or apply for certain optional/additional features or products offered through
									Diamonds.Net Web sites, you will be required to provide additional information to
									establish that you qualify for such features or products.</li></ul>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.2 Transaction Information</span>
							<br>
							When you list a diamond for sale, purchase or sell a diamond, or use the Services
							in any way, we record information related to each transaction, including the amount
							of the transaction. We retain this information for each of your transactions through
							Diamonds.Net. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer
							or device you use to access your Rapaport account, in order to help detect possible
							instances of unauthorized transactions.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.3 Information About You From Third Parties </span>
							<br>
							In order to protect us and our customers against potential fraud, we may verify
							with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification,
							we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. This
							may include background and credit checks by obtaining information about you and
							your business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun
							&amp; Bradstreet. If you incur a debt to Rapaport, we will generally conduct a credit
							check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the
							extent permitted by law. Rapaport, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right
							periodically to retrieve and review a business and / or consumer credit report for
							any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained
							during this credit review process.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.4 Additional Verification </span>
							<br>
							If we cannot verify the information that you provide we may ask you to send us additional
							information by fax (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or
							a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address),
							or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.5 Web Site Traffic Information </span>
							<br>
							Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive
							at or leave the Diamonds.Net Web site, we automatically receive the Web address
							of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which
							pages of our Web site you visit while you are on the site, the type of browser you
							use and the times you access our Web site. We use this information only to try to
							understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers,
							so as to improve our service and your experience with Rapaport. We do not track
							the Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the Rapaport site.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.6 Our Use of “Cookies” </span>
							<br>
							Diamonds.Net uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience. Cookies are small
							pieces of information saved by your browser onto your computer. Cookies are used
							to remember various aspects of your visit. This information is used by Diamonds.Net
							to guarantee a consistent and uninterrupted experience. Cookies will allow you to
							revisit without losing many of your settings. We do not use cookies to save personal
							information for outside uses.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.7 Customer Service Correspondence </span>
							<br>
							If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such information
							in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence
							and other correspondence from Rapaport to you. We retain these records in order
							to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud
							and violations of our Terms of Service Agreement. We may, over time, delete these
							records if permitted by law.<br>
							<br>
							<span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.8 Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data </span>
							<br>
							From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for
							such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests
							and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the
							survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users
							in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information
							will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire. <a name="use">

							<br>
							<li><span class="TOSHeading">Our Use and Disclosure of Information</span> <br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.1 Internal Uses </span>
								<br>
								We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the
								United States . We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide
								our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to
								determine your eligibility to receive special trading privileges or products and
								4) to improve our products and services.<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.2 Disclosure to Other Rapaport Customers </span>
								<br>
								If you are a registered RapNet or INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange member, your name,
								Company name, telephone numbers and e-mail address in addition to the diamonds you
								are listing for sale may be displayed to other RapNet or INDEX-Internet Diamond
								Exchange members. However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial
								information will NEVER be revealed to anyone except with your express written permission
								or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.3 Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Rapaport Customers
								</span>
								<ul>
									<li>Rapaport will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to
										third parties. Rapaport will not share any of your personally identifiable information
										with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with
										your express permission (and with other Rapaport customers as described above).
										These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information
										for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.</li>
									<li>We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment,
										order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including
										subpoenas from private parties in a civil action.
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. We disclose information to your agent or legal
										representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian
										appointed for you).
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. We share aggregated statistical data with our
										business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific
										percentage of our users have addresses in New York . However, this aggregated information
										is not tied to personally identifiable information.
										<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries,
										affiliates and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you,
										enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.<br>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.4 Our Contacts with Rapaport Customers </span>
								<br>
								We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services,
								and we also communicate by phone or letter. We use your e-mail to send information,
								transaction confirmations and to send notices and other disclosures required by
								law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily
								informational in nature rather than promotional.
								<p>
									We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you
									can control, including the Rapaport Tradewire weekly email.
								</p>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.5 Internet Address Information </span>
								<br>
								We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer
								the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for
								aggregate use.
								<br>
								<br>
								<span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.6 Your Use of Information and Our Services </span>
								<ul>
									<li>In order to facilitate the transactions between Rapaport members, our Service allows
										you limited access other users' contact or shipping information. As a member you
										may have access to the User ID, email address and other contact or shipping information
										of other members.</li>
									<li>By consenting to the applicable Terms of Service, you agree that, with respect to
										other users' personally identifiable information that you obtain through the site
										or through an Rapaport-related communication or Rapaport-facilitated transaction,
										you will only use this information for: (a) Rapaport-related communications that
										are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through Rapaport
										(e.g. diamond sales, shipping or insurance), and (c) any other purpose that such
										user expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).</li>
									<li>In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves from
										your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition,
										under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally
										identifiable information about another Rapaport user to any third party without
										our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that
										law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with
										respect to information they access.</li>
									<li>Rapaport does not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you
										may not add a Rapaport user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their
										express consent after adequate disclosure, even if said user has previously made
										a purchase from you. We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy. To report Rapaport-related
										spam to Rapaport, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@diamonds.net">info@diamonds.net</a>.

								4.1 Rapaport is committed to handling your customer information with high standards
								of information security. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information
								to employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services
								to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with
								federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.<br>
								<br>
								4.2 The security of your subscription to any of the Services also relies on your
								protection of your password. You may not share your password with anyone. Rapaport
								will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in
								an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the website.<br>
								<br>
								4.3 Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide
								sensitive account information via email, should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious
								and should be reported to Rapaport immediately. If you do share your Rapaport password
								with a third party for any reason, the third party will have access to your account
								and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using
								your password. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password,
								please contact us immediately.</li>
