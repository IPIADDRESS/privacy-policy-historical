		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.1</span> The Diamonds.Net website offers free as well as subscriber/membership based services (“the Services”). In order to operate the Services and to be in compliance with the USA PATRIOT ACT, Rapaport USA Inc. (“Rapaport” or “we”) may ask you to provide us with company, personal, credit card and/or bank account details. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect and how we use that information. <br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.2</span> Rapaport takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or a list of our customers to third parties. However, as described in more detail in Paragraph 3 below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to review this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy applies to all services that are hosted on the Diamonds.Net Web site, whether the services are offered by Rapaport, by its subsidiaries, or by its affiliates in the Rapaport Group.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.3</span> By using the Diamonds.Net website, you agree to accept the Privacy Policy and Diamonds.Net Terms of Use . By applying for any of the subscription or membership based services offered through the Diamonds.Net website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the terms of the  <a href="TOS.asp">Diamonds.Net Terms of Use.</a><br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.4</span> Please note that your personal information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States , in accordance with United States laws. Rapaport will hold and transmit your personal information in a safe, confidential and secure environment. If you object to your personal information being transferred or used as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not register for the Services.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.5 Notification of Changes
		    </span>
		    <ul><li>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Services or as we incorporate suggestions from our customers. If we are going to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time we collected the information, you will have a choice as to whether or not we use or disclose your information in this new manner. Any material changes will be effective only 30 days after we post an amended Privacy Policy.</li>
		    <li>We will post the amended Privacy Policy prominently on our Web site so that you can always review what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the Diamonds.Net Web site at www.Diamonds.net at any time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy.</li></ul>

		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">1.6</span> Diamonds.Net Web site may include links to third party Web sites. These sites are governed by their own privacy statements, and Rapaport is not responsible for their operations, including but not limited to their information practices.

		    <span class="TOSHeading">Information We Collect</span> <a name="information"></a><br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.1 Required Information
		    </span>
		    <ul><li>To subscribe to the Services, you must provide company details, address, phone number, and e-mail address. In order to trade through our INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange or RapNet trading systems, you must provide trade references, credit card, debit card and bank account information. This required information is necessary for us to approve your membership and to process transactions or to contact you should the need arise in administering your membership. </li>
		    <li>For USA PATRIOT ACT purposes we are required to collect your Employee Identification Number (“EIN”) or other Taxpayer Identification Number (“TIN”). If you choose to register or apply for certain optional/additional features or products offered through Diamonds.Net Web sites, you will be required to provide additional information to establish that you qualify for such features or products.</li></ul>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.2 Transaction Information</span> <br>
		    When you list a diamond for sale, purchase or sell a diamond, or use the Services in any way, we record information related to each transaction, including the amount of the transaction. We retain this information for each of your transactions through Diamonds.Net. We also collect the Internet address (IP address) of the computer or device you use to access your Rapaport account, in order to help detect possible instances of unauthorized transactions.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.3 Information About You From Third Parties </span><br>
		    In order to protect us and our customers against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information you provide. In the course of such verification, we receive personally identifiable information about you from such services. This may include background and credit checks by obtaining information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet. If you incur a debt to Rapaport, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, to the extent permitted by law. Rapaport, at its sole discretion, also reserves the right periodically to retrieve and review a business and / or consumer credit report for any account, and reserves the right to close an account based on information obtained during this credit review process.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.4 Additional Verification </span><br>
		    If we cannot verify the information that you provide we may ask you to send us additional information by fax (such as your drivers' license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information linking you to the applicable address), or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.5 Web Site Traffic Information </span><br>
		    Because of the way that World Wide Web communication standards work, when you arrive at or leave the Diamonds.Net Web site, we automatically receive the Web address of the site that you came from or are going to. We also collect information on which pages of our Web site you visit while you are on the site, the type of browser you use and the times you access our Web site. We use this information only to try to understand our customers' preferences better and to manage the load on our servers, so as to improve our service and your experience with Rapaport. We do not track the Web sites that you visit before or after you leave the Rapaport site.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.6 Our Use of “Cookies” </span><br>
		    Diamonds.Net uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience. Cookies are small pieces of information saved by your browser onto your computer. Cookies are used to remember various aspects of your visit. This information is used by Diamonds.Net to guarantee a consistent and uninterrupted experience. Cookies will allow you to revisit without losing many of your settings. We do not use cookies to save personal information for outside uses.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.7 Customer Service Correspondence </span><br>
		    If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we retain such information in the records of your account. We will also retain customer service correspondence and other correspondence from Rapaport to you. We retain these records in order to measure and improve our customer service, and to investigate potential fraud and violations of our Terms of Service Agreement. We may, over time, delete these records if permitted by law.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">2.8 Questionnaires, Surveys and Profile Data </span><br>
		    From time to time, we offer optional questionnaires and surveys to our users for such purposes as collecting demographic information or assessing users' interests and needs. The use of the information collected will be explained in detail in the survey itself. If we collect personally identifiable information from our users in these questionnaires and surveys, the users will be given notice of how the information will be used prior to their participation in the survey or questionnaire. <a name="use"></a><br>
		    <br><li><span class="TOSHeading">Our Use and Disclosure of Information</span> <br>
		      <span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.1 Internal Uses </span><br>
		    We collect, store and process your personal information on servers located in the United States . We use the information we collect about you in order 1) to provide our services and process your transactions, 2) to provide customer service, 3) to determine your eligibility to receive special trading privileges or products and 4) to improve our products and services.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.2 Disclosure to Other Rapaport Customers </span><br>
		    If you are a registered RapNet or INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange member, your name, Company name, telephone numbers and e-mail address in addition to the diamonds you are listing for sale may be displayed to other RapNet or INDEX-Internet Diamond Exchange members. However, your credit card number, bank account and other financial information will NEVER be revealed to anyone except with your express written permission or if we are required to do so pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.<br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.3 Disclosure to Third Parties Other Than Rapaport Customers
		    </span>
		    <ul><li>Rapaport will not sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. Rapaport will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties except in the limited circumstances described below, or with your express permission (and with other Rapaport customers as described above). These third parties are limited by law or by contract from using the information for secondary purposes beyond the purposes for which the information is shared.</li>
		    <li>We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. <br>
		    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. We disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
		    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. We share aggregated statistical data with our business partners or for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a specific percentage of our users have addresses in New York . However, this aggregated information is not tied to personally identifiable information.
		    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.<br></li></ul>	    
		    <br><span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.4 Our Contacts with Rapaport Customers </span><br>
		    We communicate with users on a regular basis via e-mail to provide requested services, and we also communicate by phone or letter. We use your e-mail to send information, transaction confirmations and to send notices and other disclosures required by law. Generally, users cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
		    <p>We also use your e-mail address to send you other types of communications that you can control, including the Rapaport Tradewire weekly email. </p>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.5 Internet Address Information </span><br>
		    We use IP addresses, browser types and access times to analyze trends, administer the site, improve site performance and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. <br>
		    <br>
		    <span class="TOS-SubHeading">3.6 Your Use of Information and Our Services
            </span>		    
		    <ul><li>In order to facilitate the transactions between Rapaport members, our Service allows you limited access other users' contact or shipping information. As a member you may have access to the User ID, email address and other contact or shipping information of other members.</li>
		    <li>By consenting to the applicable Terms of Service, you agree that, with respect to other users' personally identifiable information that you obtain through the site or through an Rapaport-related communication or Rapaport-facilitated transaction, you will only use this information for: (a) Rapaport-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through Rapaport (e.g. diamond sales, shipping or insurance), and (c) any other purpose that such user expressly agrees to after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).</li>
		    <li>In all cases, you must provide users with the opportunity to remove themselves from your database and review any information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another Rapaport user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access.</li>
		    <li>Rapaport does not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you may not add a Rapaport user to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure, even if said user has previously made a purchase from you. We strictly enforce our Anti-Spam Policy. To report Rapaport-related spam to Rapaport, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@diamonds.net">info@diamonds.net</a>. <br>
