  <p>The categories of information we collect can include:</p>
  <b><u>Information We Collect From You Directly.</u></b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Registration.</b>  You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must create an account in order to access some of the features of our site.  When you create an account, we may collect personal information, such as your email address, user name and password and date of birth.  If you take part in any interactive features of the Services (such as any contests, games, promotions, quizzes, surveys, research or other services or features), we may collect additional types of personal information.  We may also collect information from you if you correspond with us directly.</li>
    <li><b>Profile Information and User Content.</b>After you set up your account, Rap Genius members may also chose to provide additional information which may be shared through public profiles, such as your user name, a picture to represent yourself (which may or may not be a photo of you), and a personal narrative.  You control how much personally identifying information you wish to provide in your public profile. We may collect User Content you provide on the Website and we may display it publicly on your user Profile.  For example, your profile page may display information about the pages, artists, or works upon which you have commented.  Such information may include "favorites" such as artists, songs and lines.  Other users can post to a wall in this profile, where the public can view references to your comments you have made on the Website.

    <li><b>Information we may receive from social network sites:</b>When you interact with our site through various social media, such as when you login with or link to your social media account, "Like" us on Facebook or share through another social media site, we may receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.

  <b><u>Information Automatically Collected.</u></b>

  <p>We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time.

When you access our site through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification number associated with your device and other device information.  We may also employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.  In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.   The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service.</p>

    <li>Third parties who we think may offer you products or services you may enjoy.  As of November 2013, Rap Genius does not share your personal information with third parties for advertising purposes, however we reserve the right to share your personal information, such as email address and user name, with third parties for their marketing purposes in the future if we determine that there may be additional products or services which may be of interest to you.

    <li>Third parties at your request.  For example, you may have the option to share your activities on our Services with your friends through social media; </li>

    <li>Third parties as required to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena/court order, legal process or other government request, (ii) enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, including the investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Rap Genius, its users or the public as required or permitted by law and (v) detect, prevent or otherwise address criminal (including fraud or stalking), security or technical issues.
    We may also share information with others in an aggregated and anonymous form that does not reasonably identify you directly as an individual.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="sec3">3.	YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

  <p><b>Marketing Communications.</b>If you do not want to receive promotional emails from us, you can click the "unsubscribe" button on promotional email communications.  Note that you will not be able to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, password reminders, changes or updates to features of the Service, or technical and security notices.  </p>

  <p>As of November 2013, Rap Genius does not share your personal information with third parties for advertising purposes, however we reserve the right to share your personal information, such as email address and user name, with third parties for their marketing purposes in the future if we determine that there may be additional products or services which may be of interest to you.  If you wish to have your user name and email address excluded from any such future sharing with partners, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@rapgenius.com">privacy@rapgenius.com</a> with the subject "Direct Marketing Opt-Out."  We will not send you an individualized notification that this policy is being updated if we elect to share information with a partner in this manner, so you must opt-out now.  If you have any questions about this opt-out or our marketing practices, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rapgenius.com">privacy@rapgenius.com</a>.  </p>

  <p><b>Online Advertising.</b> As of November, 2013, Rap Genius does not engage in online behavioral advertising and does not allow third parties to track your activities on our website over time and across other websites.   In the future, we may share certain tracking information with online advertising networks so that they may display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites or apps.  Typically, the information we would share in this regard is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies.  The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device.  Please refer to your browser's or mobile device's technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.  (To learn more about behavioral advertising and to learn how to opt-out, you may wish to visit <a href="http://aboutads.info">http://aboutads.info</a>).  Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.  </p>

  <p><b>Do Not Track.</b> At this time, we do not collect information from you for behavioral advertising purposes, though we may collect persistent identifiers from your browser or mobile device to assist us with providing and improving the Service.  Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data only for analytic and internal purposes, your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your mobile browser will not have any effect on our collection of analytics information or the collection of a persistent identifier.  </p>

  <p><b>Data Access and Retention:</b> If you wish to change or delete your profile and personal information, you may contact us at privacy@rapgenius.com and we will amend or delete your personal information within a reasonable time after your request.  Because of the crowd-sourced and collaborative nature of our service, however, we will not be able to delete content you post to public areas of our site. We may be able to anonymize your information such that you will no longer be reasonably identifiable.  </p>
