Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that allows computers, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user via the internet, such as the pages on the site that the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. <br><br><span>Cookies</span> <br>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses, or harvest your personal information. Razorgator uses cookies to help analyze our web page flow, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to foster trust and safety. <br><br>First and foremost, you can rest assured that no personally identifiable information ("PII") about you (e.g., name, address, etc.) is gathered or stored in the cookies placed by the Razorgator.com web site and, as a result, none can be passed on to any third parties. <br><br>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Of course, by changing the options on your web browser or using certain software programs, you can control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your browser. Razorgator supports your right to block any unwanted internet activity, especially that of unscrupulous websites. However, blocking Razorgator cookies may disable certain features on our site and may make it impossible to purchase or use certain services available on the site. Please note that it is possible to block cookie activity from certain web sites while permitting cookies from sites you trust, like Razorgator. <br><br><span>General information Razorgator collects and why</span> <br>“General Information” is information about you or your activities on our site that do not identify you personally.

We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely. <br><br>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Please note that we have greater control over recently collected data than over archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies. <br><br><span>Opting out of promotional emails</span> <br>At any time, you can unsubscribe from our Get The Edge or other newsletter or similar services through the "My Account" link, accessible on the Razorgator home page. <br><br>As a customer or promotion/sweepstakes entrant, you will occasionally receive email updates from us about ticket sales in your area, special offers, new Razorgator services, and other noteworthy items.

Accordingly, as a condition to delivery of tickets purchased for any 2006 World Cup event, this information must be provided for each ticket user as part of the checkout procedure, or Razorgator will be unable to deliver the World Cup tickets to you.
