<h2>The Razoo Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Our privacy policy is simple--we are vigilant about protecting yours. Our mission is to serve donors and provide you with the best possible experience so you can focus on your giving, and that all starts with a trusting relationship.</p>

<p>Razoo and our partner, Network for Good, will never sell, trade, or rent your personal information to other individuals or companies. The information you provide will only be used to complete your donation and to provide you with tools to manage and monitor your transactions. With your permission, your name and contact information will be provided to the charity you support through Razoo and Network for Good. If you do not wish to share your name and contact information with the charity you supported, or you choose to make your donation anonymously, neither Razoo nor Network for Good will share your name or contact information.</p>

<p>We do offer several ways to stay in touch with Razoo and the organizations you support, and we always put you in control of that communication. We are constantly working to deliver the information you need to make good decisions and understand how your money is put to use, but we also appreciate the fact that not everyone wants that. There are some communications, however, that we (and the government) consider critical and you will definitely receive from Razoo and Network For Good--such as a donation confirmation or an alert about a problem with your credit card.
If you ever have a question about our policies or feel that we are not living up to this standard, weâ€™d love to talk. Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:support@razoo.com">support@razoo.com</a> and we will get back to you promptly.</p></div>

  <dl> <dt><strong>What is Razoo?</strong></dt> <dd>Razoo is a better place to give. We provide inspiration, information, and practical tools to help givers make a difference with their money. Our marketplace helps you find great organizationsprojects to support, and our portfolio management tools help you gain clarity and focus around your giving. The name "Razoo" reflects our goal to unlock the potential of every dollar invested in the lives of others (and to give you a great experience along the way).</dd> <dt>How many non-profits are in Razoo's catalog?</dt> <dd>There are more than 1.6 million charities in our catalog.  You may donate to any 501(c)3 organization through Razoo.</dd> <dt>Is my gift tax-deductible?</dt> <dd>Yes. Your gift is tax deductible within the guidelines of U.S. law.  You will need to retain your email donation receipt as a record (you can always retrieve it from your giving profile here on Razoo as well).</dd> <dt>Does it cost anything to make a donation through Razoo?</dt> <dd>No, all of your money goes directly to the charity. Typically, online donations carry a transaction fee that can be up to 10% of the total donation-- but not here.  We want to remove barriers to giving and this is one way we accomplish that.</dd> <dt>How does the money get to the organization of my choice?</dt> <dd>Razoo has partnered with Network for Good to process all donations made through our site.  Network for Good then works through VeriSign to get payments from your credit card. If the charity you recommended has provided its electronic funds transfer (EFT) information to Network for Good, your donation will be electronically transmitted through our secure servers to the charity's bank account. If the charity has not provided EFT information, Network for Good will mail a check directly to the charity. Donations are sent to charities on the 15th of each month. Network for Good and Verisign are both highly trusted and respected organizations, so we encourage you to explore their services if you would like more information.</dd> <dt>Can I specify how the charity may use my donation?</dt> <dd>Yes...to a degree. When you make a donation via Razoo, you may specify how you'd like your donation to be used by the charity by entering the information in the "Designation" field. We will pass along the request with your donation, but we can't go as far as guarantee that the charities will honor your request. If this is an issue for you, we encourage you to contact the charity directly to make sure they are able to allocate your money as you desire.</dd> <dt>How do I sign-up?</dt> <dd> It's easy to get started.  Create a username and password  by clicking on "Join Now" at the top of the site, and you'll be on your way.</dd> <dt>I don't remember my password</dt> <dd>No worries, we'll send you a link so you can change it (for security purposes, we can't send you your current password). Click on "Forgot Password?" in the Giving Portfolio tab at the top of the page.</dd> <dl></dl></dl>
