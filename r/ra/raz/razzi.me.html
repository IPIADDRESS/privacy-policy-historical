<p>
  Razzi recognizes that privacy is important. Our privacy policy applies to all of the products, services,
  and websites offered by Razzi. By using our site, you consent to the terms in this privacy policy. Razzi’s
  purpose is to enable its users to upload and share photos. We consider the photos and other metadata to be
  the private information of our users.
</p>

<p>
  Razzi enables sharing photos with both authenticated and anonymous viewers over the Internet, while providing
  you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. Our network architecture
  and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We
  allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and family relationships through Razzi.
</p>

<p>
  Our primary responsibility is to our users, who in turn have relationships with their viewers. This privacy
  policy covers both our users and the viewers of our user’s photos and other information.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Security and Privacy Information for Razzi Users</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You can change your security and privacy settings at any time by visiting your
  <a href="/settings/preferences/edit">preferences</a>. You are in complete control of how much security and
  access you choose. You decide which photos to upload and who should be allowed to see them. You can choose
  Public (the entire world), Protected (Razzi friends only), or Private (only yourself) to view your content.
  Razzi's role is to enable you to upload photos and receive feedback from your viewers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What Information Does Razzi Collect?</strong>
</p>

<p>When you visit Razzi pages, you provide us with a few types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>personal information you knowingly choose to disclose</li>
  <li>system usage information regarding your photos</li>
  <li>website user and technical support information</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When you register an account with Razzi, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your
  email address.
</p>

<p>
  When you upload photos, we store the digital photos you give us, the photo descriptions and other information
  you enter to customize your photos. We also log certain usage information on our servers as you upload and
  manage your photos.
</p>

<p>
  When you request support we may collect information about the nature of your problem and we may log additional
  information about system usage to try to help you.
</p>

<p>
  When you enter Razzi, we collect your browser type and operating system type through Google Analytics. This
  information is gathered for all Razzi visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using
  "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about the user. We use session
  ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. To make
  it easier for you to login when you return to Razzi, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID, but not
  your password. If you want to disable this convenience feature, you can remove or block this cookie using the
  settings in your browser.
</p>

<p>
  When you use Razzi, you create your personal profile and upload photos, comment on photos/albums/profiles, and
  transmit information through various means. We collect this information so we can provide you the service and
  offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so, for example, you can easily see your friend or family
  member list, or view prior messages you have sent.
</p>

<p>
  You post your content on the site at your own risk. Although you control settings for privacy options that limit
  access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the
  actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not
  guarantee that content you post on the site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for
  circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. You understand and acknowledge that,
  even after removal, copies of content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied
  or stored your content.
</p>

<p>
  Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Razzi is a violation of the Razzi Terms of Use and should
  be reported to <a href="mailto:support@razzi.me">support@razzi.me</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How Do You Protect My Information?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  When you access your personal information we implement a variety of security measures to ensure the safety of your
  personal information.
</p>

<p>
  These security measures might include: password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information,
  SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet
  securely or PCI Scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
  After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What Are Public, Protected, and Private Privacy Settings?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Razzi users can mark their photos as Public, Protected or Private.
</p>

<p>
  A photo set as Public is public on the web and viewable to anyone who knows the URL of your public photo. Your public
  photos may also appear in search results (if you allow them to do so), in <a href="/explore">Explore</a> and
  on the homepage.
</p>

<p>
  A photo set as Protected (friends only) limits who can see it. User's you have marked as a Friend on Razzi are the
  only people that can see these photos. Protected photos can be searched on Razzi, but will only show up if it is an
  authorized user (friend) searching.
</p>

<p>
  A photo set as Private is for personal use only. They cannot be shared. Private photos are not searchable on Razzi.
</p>

<p>
  Razzi users can modify their photo privacy settings using either the dropdown menu when editing an existing individual
  photo or to a number of photos using the <a href="/editor">Editor</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Security of Sensitive Information</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Razzi takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. When you enter sensitive information (such as
  credit card numbers or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Because
  email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information
  to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of the Razzi Web Site, please
  contact us at <a href="mailto:support@razzi.me">support@razzi.me</a>. Razzi utilizes third party online storage
  vendors to store photos and relies on the security of those vendors to keep data secure.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>How Does Razzi Use My Information?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  When you register with Razzi, you create your own profile. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and
  photos, are displayed to people in the relationships specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with
  people on Razzi. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services
  offered by Razzi that we think you may find valuable.
</p>

<p>
  Public Profile information you provided about yourself will be available for public to see.
</p>

<p>
  Razzi may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For
  instance, if a user sends you a new friend request, you may receive an email alerting you of that action.
</p>

<p>
  We utilize system usage information and logged diagnostic information to improve our service. We also look at aggregate
  demographic information to try to understand who are users are and to guide future product development.
</p>

<p>
  Razzi and its team use transmission data and HTTP protocol elements for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Website and system administration</li>
  <li>Research and development</li>
  <li>Anonymous user analysis</li>
  <li>Anonymous user profiling and decision-making</li>
  <li>To provide statistics to photo owners on the use of their photos</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Do You Share Information With Third Parties?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Razzi does not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We do not share, sell,
  or rent your email address to third parties. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances
  where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you.
  For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your news feed may aggregate the information you provide and make it available to your friends and network members according
    to your privacy settings. You may set your preferences for your news feed in your Razzi privacy settings on your Razzi home
    page.
    <br>
    Razzi offers user controls to block access to open site information by third party search engine "crawlers" (e.g. Google,
    Yahoo, etc.). Generally, search engines respect markup on pages that directs search engines to exclude the site content, but
    respecting such conventions is voluntary on the part of the search engines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and
    technical protections limiting the use of that information to Razzi-specified purposes. We may provide information to service
    providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such
    as to host the service at a co-location or other facility for servers, to send out email updates about Razzi, to process and
    fulfill print and other photo services, to remove repetitive information from our user lists or to process payments for products
    or services. In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal
    information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.
  </li>
  <li>
    We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance
    with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement
    or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe
    it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated
    through the Razzi service or using the Razzi name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with
    other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Razzi business were to change, your user information may be transferred to the
    new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject
    to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you use Razzi, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or family member), such as personal
    information, comments, messages, photos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings
    you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please be aware that if you disclose personal information in
    your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos, or other items, this information may become publicly available.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>What About Links?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Razzi may contain links to other websites. We do not review or monitor any websites linked from Razzi and are not responsible for the
  privacy practices or content of any such linked web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
  privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
  information collected by Razzi.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Can I Modify Or Delete My Personal Information?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Access and control over most personal information on Razzi is readily available through your Account Settings options. Razzi users can
  modify or delete any of their personal information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately.
  If you want to deactivate your Razzi account, you may do so from the Account Overview page. Removed information may persist in
  backup copies and cached or archived pages for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to users of Razzi.
</p>

<p>
  When you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Razzi, you can
  always delete them.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Information For Viewers</strong>
</p>

<p>
  You don't have to register for an account to view photos posted on Razzi. If you view a Razzi user's content, we may collect
  certain information from you. Each Razzi user also has access to some of the data we collect. For example, visitor reports
  and view statistics.
</p>

<p>
  Razzi does not control what its users do with the data we share. Razzi expects and requires its users to abide by Razzi’s
  Terms of Use. We will terminate a users’s account if we become aware that a Razzi user has violated our terms of service.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Terms of Use, Notices, and Revisions</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Your use of Razzi, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as our Terms of Use and
  all of its dispute resolution provisions, limitation on damages and choice of law. We encourage you to refer to our policy
  on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy
  applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and
  our Terms of Use at any time. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the date of the change. This
  policy was last modified on 3/10/2011.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>CAN-SPAM Compliance</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Razzi has taken the necessary steps to ensure that we are in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 by never sending out
  misleading information.
