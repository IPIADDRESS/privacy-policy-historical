<p><strong>Razorfish Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected through the web site located at the URL: www.Razorfish.com; whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology. The Site is offered by Razorfish, LLC (“<strong>Razorfish</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected through the Site, how such information may be used and/or shared with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use in connection with our marketing communications and activities.</p>

<p>Razorfish strives to collect, use and disclose user data in a manner consistent with the privacy and data security laws of the countries in which it does business.&nbsp; Because of the differences among these jurisdictions, Razorfish has adopted a Privacy Policy which creates a common core of values, policies and procedures intended to achieve nearly universal compliance, supplemented with alternative or additional policies or implementation procedures applicable in those jurisdictions with unique requirements. This Privacy Policy establishes a minimum global standard for collecting, using and protecting information that Razorfish collects from users of <a href="http://www.Razorfish.com">www.Razorfish.com</a>.</p>

<p>While this Privacy Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our information processing activities, those processing activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws.&nbsp; For example, the laws of a particular country may limit the types of personal information we can collect or the manner in which we process that information. In those instances, we adjust our internal policies and practices to reflect the requirements of local law and local laws will prevail over terms in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>1. Information Collected On Our Site</h3>

<p><strong>Information You Provide To Us</strong></p>

<p>When you use the Site, we or our service providers may collect <strong>Personal Information</strong> (information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally) such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number or mailing address. &nbsp;We may also collect Personal Information submitted to us in connection with job applications through the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically </strong></p>

<p><em>Usage Information</em>. Whenever you visit or interact with the Site, Razorfish, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Site is accessed and used (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This information helps us keep our website fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.</p>

<p><em>Device Identifiers</em>. Razorfish may also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>”) you use to access the Site. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Site, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify, and gather broad demographic or firmagraphic information for aggregate use.</p>

<p><em>Cookies; Pixel Tags</em>. The technologies used on the Site to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed).&nbsp; Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Site and your activities on such social networking sites.&nbsp; We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Site (such as allowing us to select which content, ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic or firmagraphic information).&nbsp; A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.</p>

<p>Similarly, we use Google Analytics to help us track and analyze usage of our Site, using cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.</p>

<p>To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, please refer to your browser’s help menu or other instructions related to your browser.&nbsp; If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our Site may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.&nbsp; These features are not yet uniform, so note that our systems are not configured to recognize Do Not Track headers or signals from some or all browsers.</p>

<p>You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser.</p>

<h3>2. How We Use The Information Collected Through Our Site</h3>

Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our affiliates, sponsors, partners, advertisers or other third parties, including lead generation companies to provide you with product information and promotional and other offers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared.&nbsp; </strong>While on our Site, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party.&nbsp; If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.</p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>.&nbsp; Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities in the Publicis Groupe family of companies for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes.&nbsp; As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.&nbsp; If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the Site, Personal Information, Usage Information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of the Site may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets.&nbsp; Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
