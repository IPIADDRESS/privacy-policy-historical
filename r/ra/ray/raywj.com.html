<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY (INCLUDING YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS)</strong></p>
<p>Last Updated April 13, 2011</p>
<p>At&nbsp;<a href="http://raywj.com/">RayWJ.com</a>, we appreciate your readership and respect your privacy. This is the official privacy policy and California privacy rights (referred to collectively herein as our <strong>“Privacy Policy”).</strong> Our Privacy Policy governs the Personal Information (as defined below) collected by this website, but does not cover any other information, whether collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, nor on any other website or service unless specifically stated.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Our Privacy Policy is intended to <strong>explain our privacy practices</strong> and inform you as to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users and how such Personal Information is collected; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How we use Personal Information; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information we collect about you; and </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. </strong></p>
<p>If for any reason, you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use any of this website at all because by doing so, you will have indicated that you have accepted same.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time and from time-to-time by posting an updated version on this website, without advance notice to you, or we may, in our sole discretion, send you a message telling you we have made a change (for example, we may, email you about the changes). The changes shall be effective to you immediately upon our posting or when you receive our message, whichever is sooner. We encourage you to check our Privacy Policy often so you are aware of the most current terms and conditions that apply to you.</p>
<p>When we use the term <strong>“Personal Information,” we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, mobile device number, telephone number, profile, your photograph or audio-visual images of you, your instant-messenger nickname, blog, vlog or any personal website URL, your date of birth, email address, gender and any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact you. Personal Information also </strong>includes information about your personal preferences, survey responses, and your transactions and interactions with us, if you are or have been a registered user or you have provided this type of information to us. Personal Information may also be contained in postings you post on this website or submit to us or any other user.&nbsp; If you make purchases on our Site, in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, service or product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number, and information about your computer’s internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to our website (<em>e.g.</em>, the referring URL).&nbsp; Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “Sensitive Personal Information” and is collected via a secure transmission.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and to keeping Personal Information you share with us through the use of our website secure, including Personal Information we obtain on our website and from your postings, but you understand, acknowledge and agree that we do not and cannot control your postings, nor are or shall we be liable if you post or make any information, about yourself or others, available (including allowing others to use your user ID or failing to protect your user ID from disclosure or use by others), on our website or otherwise. It is also important for us to explain to you how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information and help you understand these things. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission which is wireless or mobile or over the Internet is completely secure, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if we have a privacy policy that gives either an “opt-out” or “opt-in” choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, we may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>We qualify for the alternative option: we have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may either decline to permit (“opt-out) or consent to (“opt-in”) the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:Privacy@RayWJ.com">Privacy@RayWJ.com</a> or you may contact us via postal mail at:</p>
<p>RayWJ.com – Privacy Administrator</p>
<p><a href="mailto:Privacy@RayWJ.com">Privacy@RayWJ.com</a></p>
<p>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p><strong>All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled “Your California</strong> <strong>Privacy Rights” on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.</strong> For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) <strong>We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. </strong>We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, notices that are illegible or do not have complete information.</p>

<p>We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining our website and our operations. These third party specialists that provide support to our website are our “operational service providers” and we use them to efficiently provide the full range of content, subscription plans, services, promotions, advertising, downloading, streaming and other features and functions we offer or make available to you.

<p>We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Security and Protection of Personal Information.</strong> We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites and wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our website in the same way. We also limit access to our website by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy.</p>

You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use website or other activity requiring eligibility or otherwise. If you have registered as a user or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our website, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, subscription, status as a user and/or the use of or access to our website and any other services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our website, to use or access any information or to use a user ID. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions.</strong> If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you may email us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@RayWJ.com">Privacy@RayWJ.com</a> you cannot find the answer to a question related to our Privacy Policy or if you do not understand the information about how we collect, maintain, store, use or share your Personal Information you may contact our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:Privacy@RayWJ.com">Privacy@RayWJ.com</a>.</p>
