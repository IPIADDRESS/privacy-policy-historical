To the extent that the Site includes third-party advertisements, the privacy policy of the advertiser providing the advertisement will govern the use of your personal information collected during your access to the advertisement. Raytheon does not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have left our Site, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled.</p>

<p>1.4 Raytheon may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.</p>

<p>1.5 Apart from the Children's Sites, Raytheon may use the Site as an entry into other networked web pages and websites operated by Raytheon and its subsidiaries (together, the "Transaction Sites"). Please note that an individual Transaction Site may adopt privacy terms particular to the purpose of such Transaction Site or the transaction(s) taking place on such Transaction Site. As Transaction Sites are generally affiliated with commercial transactions that you or your business may have with Raytheon, particularly those which are password-protected or are subject to subscriptions, the privacy terms governing such sites may be supplemented or superseded by separate agreements.</p>

<p><strong>2. Other Types of Information That May Be Collected</strong></p>

<p>2.1 IP Addresses<br>
An internet protocol address, or IP address, is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the internet, and is used by web servers to identify your computer. When you access our Site, we may log your computer's IP address, however, your personal identity will remain unknown to us, except as described in Sections 2.5 and 3.2. We log the IP addresses for system administration, for auditing the use of our Site, and for collecting statistical information for marketing and other purposes.</p>

<p>2.2 Cookies or Tracers<br>
We may place information on your computer to allow us to identify you. This information is known as a "cookie." We use cookies to view information about your activities on our Site, such as your preferences or which pages you have visited on the Site. A cookie does not allow our Site to collect any personal information that you have not otherwise disclosed (except as described below). By understanding how and when our visitors use the Site, we can continually improve our Site, as well as our products and services. Your browser may have controls that allow you to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

<p>We use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your computer by another non-Raytheon website. These are used by Raytheon to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a career site where Raytheon placed a banner advertisement. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of the internet unrelated to Raytheon, or to determine your personal information, and you remain anonymous to Raytheon unless you choose to provide personal information, except as explained in Section 3.2.</p>

<p>2.3 Web Beacons<br>
Web beacons are small files that we may place on our Site, which count the number of unique users that have visited a specific page on the Site and the number of times a given page has been displayed. This information is collected generally in the aggregate and is not linked to any personal information (except as described below).</p>

<p>2.4 Pixel Tags<br>
We may use "pixel tags," or short pieces of code, to better measure the effectiveness of our content. These also allow social networks and other services to deliver content to you based on your visit to our website.</p>

<p>2.5 Custom URLs<br>
We may track your visit by providing you with a unique universal resource locator, or URL, via an e-mail, a letter or other communication. When you use this unique URL, our website registers the visit. We use this information to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other content.</p>

<p>2.6 What Happens If I Register?<br>
Registration may be allowed or required on the Site. Together, the provisions of this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use for the Site, and any additional conditions presented to you upon registration govern our use of information you provide during registration. In addition to the uses described above, Raytheon may collect registration data in order to monitor compliance with this Privacy Policy and to set up access permissions to certain other pages on the Site.</p>

<p>2.7 Do-Not-Track<br>
Our information collection practices operate as described in this Privacy Policy independent of any "do-not-track" choice you make.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use of Information</strong></p>

<p>3.1 Use and Sharing of Information</p>

<p>Raytheon and its subsidiaries and affiliates may use and disclose your personal information only as set forth herein, except where the terms of a separate privacy policy apply.</p>

<p>Generally, your personal information will not be shared with third parties not affiliated with Raytheon. From time to time we may transfer, disclose or share your personal information with third parties that Raytheon has engaged specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities, including, but not limited to, conducting contests and sweepstakes. Such parties will receive your personal information needed to perform these functions, but we do not allow them to use it for other purposes without your consent. When you provide your personal information to Raytheon in response to a contest, sweepstake, or other project consistent with our <a href="https://www.raytheon.com/legal/">Terms and Conditions</a>, you consent that we may publicly disclose and use your personal information. For more information about your rights and choice, see Section 5. Your Privacy Choices/Updates to Your Information.</p>

<p>Anonymous data collected using cookies, tracers, and web beacons may be analyzed in the aggregate to determine collective user characteristics, to understand user traffic patterns, sales information and user behavior on the Site. Such information also may be shared in the aggregate with third parties for advertising purposes, to enhance our Site, to enhance our products and services, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.</p>

<p>3.2 Monitoring and Compliance</p>

<p>Although Raytheon is under no obligation to monitor the Site, we may monitor, store, review and share with third parties any information, including your personal information, obtained on or through the Site, including if it is needed or requested to satisfy any applicable governmental law, regulation, investigation or proceeding. Raytheon may also disclose your personal information (1) where such disclosure is required by law; (2) to protect Raytheon's legal rights to the extent authorized or permitted by law; or (3) in an emergency where the health or safety of you or another individual may be endangered. Additionally, we may use IP addresses to identify a particular user if we believe it is needed to enforce compliance with the terms of this policy or to protect our company, employees, Site, or customers.</p>

<p>Raytheon may transfer personal information in connection with the sale or acquisition of one or more of our businesses or subsidiaries to a different company that agrees to offer equivalent safeguards for the use and disclosure of such information.</p>

While Raytheon makes extensive effort to prevent unauthorized access to personal information, the security of information transmitted via the internet cannot be guaranteed. Any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used by others aside from the intended recipient. Thus, Raytheon cannot warrant that your personal information will not be disclosed to or accessed by unauthorized parties.</p>

Additionally, your personal information may be retained in back-up files created by our network's back-up systems.

<p><strong>6. Children's Privacy </strong></p>

<p>6.1 Raytheon encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children not to provide their real names, email or physical addresses, or telephone numbers online without the permission of a parent or guardian. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children, as may be collected on the Children's Sites only. We fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires us to take special precautions when collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>6.2 In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to help keep children safe.</p>

<p>A. Any personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Raytheon or its agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.</p>

<p>B. We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Site, email accounts, or other services within Raytheon that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personal information.</p>

<p>C. We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.</p>

<p>D. We will not knowingly keep any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved.</p>

<p>E. We will not knowingly post any personal information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.</p>

<p>F. We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.</p>

<p>G. Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Site.</p>

<p>6.3 Consistent with COPPA, there are several instances in which we collect information from children, such as:</p>

<p>A. Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of notifying the parent or guardian;</p>

<p>B. Collecting children's contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask Raytheon a question using the "contact us" link on our Sites. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child's request. We will purge the child's contact information from our systems when we have fulfilled the request, such as after we respond to the child's email or when a contest is over. We will not use children's information to re-contact them or for any other purpose other than fulfilling their requests;</p>

<p>C. Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to respond directly more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and</p>

<p>D. Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our child-directed Sites for analytics and internal operations purposes.</p>
