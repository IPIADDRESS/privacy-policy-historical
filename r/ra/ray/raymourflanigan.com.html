			  is only decoded after it reaches the secure Raymour &amp; Flanigan site. 
			</p><p> It is our policy not to ask you to send any sensitive information

			</p><p> <b class="bodycopy">We Collect the Least Amount of Information about

            </p><p><b>Order Confirmation</b></p>
            <p>You will be contacted by one of our Online Customer Service Agents 
              to confirm your order and to schedule your delivery. Our Online 
              Customer Service Agents can answer any additional questions you 
              may have about your merchandise. You can contact our Online Customer 
              Support Center by email, live chat, or by calling 315 453 2510 Ext. 
              417. </p>
            <p>You can also visit one of our convenient showrooms to view the 
              items you have selected. One of our Home Furnishings Consultants 
              will be glad to help you, and will have access to your account information. 
              To expedite the process, please bring your account number to the 
              showroom.</p>
            <p>Please note: Some merchandise may not be displayed in all locations.

            <p><b>Delivery Policy - Guaranteed On-Time Delivery!</b></p>
            <p>Raymour &amp; Flanigan understands that your busy lifestyle places 
              many demands on your time. As you juggle the priorities in your 
              day, we are there to help make your choice of furniture delivery 
              from Raymour &amp; Flanigan a timely experience.</p>
            <p>We Guarantee On-Time Delivery within a pre-identified delivery 
              window. You will be contacted by a Customer Service Agent one to 
              two days prior to your delivery and will be provided a delivery 
              time window. If Raymour &amp; Flanigan arrives after this window, 
              we will refund your delivery charge in the form of a gift certificate.</p>
            <p>Guaranteed On-Time Delivery is applicable Tuesday through Friday 
              only. You must be home during the delivery window and ready to receive 
              your delivery. Your home must be ready to receive your new furniture. 
              The Raymour &amp; Flanigan delivery team can not move existing furniture 
              to other rooms in your home. This is a critical courtesy in meeting 
              the time needs of all customers waiting for their delivery that 
              day.</p>
            <p>We appreciate your understanding that significant acts of nature, 
              and our concern for the safety of the delivery teams and the public 
              will cancel this program for that day. No refunds will be made.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Return Policy</b></p>
            <p>Raymour &amp; Flanigan Furniture wants you to be completely satisfied 
              with your purchase. Orders may be canceled with no penalty prior 
              to receiving your delivery confirmation phone call from the Regional 
              Customer Service Center. This will happen one to two days prior 
              to delivery.</p>
            <p>Once your delivery date has been confirmed, your furniture is transferred 
              from our Distribution Center to the Regional Customer Service Center 
              in your area for preparation and delivery. After this date, the 
              delivery charge is non-refundable.</p>
            <p>Once your furniture has been delivered, service related issues 
              can be handled by visiting our online Customer Service Center, or 
              by calling your Regional Customer Service Center. You can find the 
              phone number for your Customer Service Center on the order confirmation 
              email you will receive, or by selecting a nearby store in our Showroom 
              Locator.</p>
            <p>Any non-service related issue can be addressed by visiting one 
              of our conveniently located showrooms.</p>

              initial one-year time frame.</p>
            <p>Necessary exchanges due to manufacturing defect will be conducted
