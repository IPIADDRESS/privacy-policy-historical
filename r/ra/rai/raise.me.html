<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Raise Labs, Inc. (together with raise.me, “Raise”) is committed to providing a safe, 
secure user experience. By choosing to create a Raise Profile you are agreeing to the 
terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection and 
usage policies and practices that apply to the use of the Raise website (our “Services”).  
Your use of our Services is also governed by our <a href="/terms_of_use.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Users participate in Raise voluntarily. Raise is not responsible for the privacy policies or 
practices of other websites to which you choose to link from Raise.</p>

<h3>What Information is Collected</h3>

<p>Information collected may include, among other things, ‘Personal Information’ (which 
is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as 
your name, phone number, address, and email address), account information (such 
as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your 
account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or 
birthday, and other information about your interests and preferences).  Any information 
combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.</p>
<br>
<p>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which may include Personal 
Information, photographs, information about your academic and work history, your 
interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information (“Profile”).</p>
<br>
<p>The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly, 
through interactive features and through other communication functionality (“Community 
Forums”).  You may choose through such features or otherwise, to submit or post 
reviews, problems, suggestions, ideas, solutions, questions, answers, comments, 
testimonials, resources, or other materials (“User Content”).  Your User Content 
may also be posted in your profile.  You may edit or remove your profile information, 
but you may not be able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded material.  
Note that anything you post to a community forum may be public.  If you choose to 
voluntarily disclose Personal Information on a Community Forum, that information will be 
considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.</p>
<br>
<p>In some instances, a User that wins a scholarship award may be required to provide 
additional information, such as proof of identity (which may include a driver’s license, 
passport, voting card or similar government issued identification), proof of academic and 
work history (which may include high school transcripts, standardized test scores, or 
references from teachers or counselors), or proof of financial need (which may include 
completing a FAFSA or CSS profile, and providing other family income documentation), 
in order to claim the award.</p>
<br>
<p>If a User does provide such information, he or she is thereby consenting to the use of 
that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy 
Policy. The User maintains full rights and ownership of personal data. All information 
entered by a user is voluntary and at his or her discretion.</p>

<h3>How Information is collected</h3>

<p>Raise may collect data when a user initially logs onto Raise.me and opens an account 
(“Registration”), creates a Profile, completes a scholarship challenge, or during the use 
of other Services on the site. </p>
<br>
<p>Personal Information is mostly gathered directly from Users through online Registration 
forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, Raise Profile once it has been created. 
In some cases, with the User’s permission, the User’s school, school district, teachers, 
or parents may provide additional information about the User.</p>

<h3>Usage of Personal Information by Raise</h3>

<p>Raise uses personal information to provide information and Services that a User has 
requested; to service a User's account; to improve Raise's Services; to develop and/or 
inform Users of additional products or services we think will be of interest and benefit 
to Users; to answer questions Users may have; and to inform winners of scholarships 
awards. A user may deactivate their account at any time and their information will be 
removed from Raise’s servers or made anonymous.</p>
<br>
<p>Each User is able to edit and update their information provided in his or her Raise Profile 
or account settings. Raise may, on occasion, email our users to send notifications about 
new features on the site. Each User shall be allowed opt-out or back into to such email 
messaging.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Usage by Third Parties</h3>

<p>Raise will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other 
than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise 
provided by law. </p>
<br>
<p>We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a 
governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) 
conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or 
property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or 
(d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
<br>
<p>We do not disclose Users' Personal Information, combined personal and demographic 
information or information about use of Raise.com to Third Parties, except as set forth 
below:</p>

<h3>Sharing information on Social Media Platforms</h3>

<p>The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or 
service, such as enabling you to "like" a product within our Services or "share" content to 
other web sites, such as Facebook or Twitter. If you choose to "like" or "share" content 
or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party website, feature 
or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party website 
may have access to information about you and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you 
post information on a third party platform that references Raise or one of the Services, 
your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. 
Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company 
providing it.</p>
<br>
<p>You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through 
our Services (such as connecting to Facebook or otherwise linking the Services with 
another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such 
as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party 
web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) 
information about you, including personal information. Information about you, including 
your name and preferences, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are 
logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third 
party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer 
collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the 
information previously collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting 
to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may 
then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as 
you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose 
to share a scholarship award from Raise.me with your connections on the third party 
website).</p>
<br>
<p>The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and 
stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including 
whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information 
shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web 
site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, 
in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application 
or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may 
receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us 
access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is 
otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page 
on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p>

<h3>Sharing Information with Colleges and Universities</h3>

<p>Certain actions on the Raise site, including, but not limited to, winning micro-scholarships, submitting your micro-scholarship awards for redemption, applying to 
specific programs and scholarships, indicating you are planning to apply to a college, 
or adding a college to your list of favorite schools, may also result in your Personal 
Information being shared with a college or university.</p>
<br>
<p>Regardless of a User’s decisions regarding the sharing of his or her Personal 
Information, Raise reserves the right to share aggregate demographic data and related 
usage information with our business partners and university and college users.  Such 
aggregate information will not contain any Personal Information that can identify any 
individual user. </p>

<h3>Sharing Information with Parents, Counselors, Guardians and 
Advisors </h3>

<p>Raise may permit you to share access to your account with parents, guardians, school 
counselors or other trusted advisors. If you permit such access, they will have full or 
partial access to your account and personally identifiable information. </p>

<h3>Sharing Information with other Third Party Service Providers</h3>

<p>From time to time, Raise may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to 
perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to Raise’s users, or software 
programmers and software vendors. If we use a third party to provide specific services 
(such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then Personal Information 
(such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for 
such third party service provider to provide these services. These third party service 
providers are allowed to use Personal Information only for the purpose of providing the 
specific services requested by Raise. These third party service providers have agreed 
to hold and use your confidential information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The 
third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites 
found on our sites, which are governed by a more specific provision below.</p>

<h3>Sharing Information with other Non-Profit &amp; Corporate Scholarship 
Administrators</h3>

<p>If you are selected as a winner of a scholarship on Raise sponsored by a third party, 
such as a non-profit or Corporation, your profile information may be shared with a 
third-party scholarship administrator to select scholarship recipients. The third-party 
scholarship administrator may contact you directly to verify your profile information, 
including, but not necessarily limited to, obtaining copies of academic transcripts, proof 
of financial need if required, or any other documentation Raise or the scholarship 
administrator requires to award the scholarship and disburse funds to you, or your 
college or university.</p>

<h3>Accessibility &amp; Correction of Information</h3>

<p>If a User wishes to correct inaccuracies or make any other changes to the User’s 
profile, it can be accessed through our password protected access facility at <a href="http://&#10;www.raise.me" target="_blank">http://
www.raise.me</a>. If a User wishes to have his or her Raise Profile deactivated, he or she 
should contact Raise at <a href="mailto:support@raise.me">support@raise.me</a> or do so under account settings. Deactivating 
your Raise profile does not guarantee that your information will be removed from third 
party records. Any information gathered is to the best of our knowledge collected lawfully 
and fairly through Raise.me and all information is assumed accurate and up to date 
and only information which is adequate and not excessive to our purpose for collection 
is retained. Users may review, correct, update or change their Raise Profile and the 
information therein at any time. </p>

<h3>Other sites</h3>

<p>Once you leave Raise’s website (even if it’s via a link found on our site), we no longer 
control the ways in which your Personal Information is collected. Our Privacy Policy only 
applies to Raise’s sites and Services and does not apply to non-Raise services that you 
choose to access through Raise. When we partner with other providers, we take their 
privacy practices into consideration, but we cannot and do not take responsibility for 
anyone else’s privacy policies. Make sure you read over the privacy policies of any other 
services you access.</p>

<h3>Minimum Age</h3>

<p>Our site and services are in compliance with the requirements of the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act. Therefore, we do not collect any information from anyone under 
13 years of age, and our website, products, and Services are all directed to people who 
are at least 13 years old. Additionally, by using our site and Services, you are implicitly 
confirming that you are 13 years old or older.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>We use cookie technology within Raise.me. We use cookies for remembering User 
names and passwords and for tracking click streams. Cookies cannot obtain personally 
identifiable information such as e-mail addresses, or any other information stored on 
our Users’ hard drives. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, 
and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser 
settings; however Raise.me may not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. One 
of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save time. The 
purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. 
For example, if you personalize Raise pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us 
to recall your specific information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster 
and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience.</p>

<h3>Information Protection and Security</h3>

<p>Raise implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of users’ 
personal information. These security measures include password protected directories 
and databases to safeguard your information and SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) 
technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the 
Internet securely. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can 
be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we take sophisticated measures to 
protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any 
information you send to us and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or any questions, complaints or 
claims, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@raise.me">support@raise.me</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>We may need to modify this privacy policy from time to time to reflect our current privacy 
practices, so please check back to view any changes. When you register or submit 
your email address on any Raise site, you acknowledge receipt of this privacy policy 
and agree to receive future notices about it online. We make this policy continuously 
available online. We will inform you of material modifications to this policy in the 
future by posting changes on the Raise Labs sites and/or sending you email where 
appropriate.</p>
