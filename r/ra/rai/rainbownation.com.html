      <h1>The RainbowNation.com Privacy Statement</h1>	    
           (last updated: July 2004)<br><br>
        RainbowNation is committed to protecting your privacy. This 
        RainbowNation Privacy Statement applies to data collection and usage&nbsp;on 
        RainbowNation sites and services; it does not apply to other online or 
        offline RainbowNation sites, products or services. Please read the 
        RainbowNation Privacy Statement below and also any supplementary 
        information at the end of this statement for additional details about 
        particular RainbowNation sites and services that you may use.<br><br>
        RainbowNation is a general audience web site, intended for users of 
        all ages. Personal information of all users is collected, used and 
        disclosed as described in this Privacy Statement. This Statement 
        contains a section with specific details regarding personal information 
        collected from children. Click
        <a class="BodyLinkBlue" href="#CHILDREN">
        here</a> to read more.<br><br>
        <h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>
        At some sites, RainbowNation collects personal information, such as 
        your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. 
        RainbowNation may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP 
        code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites. Information 
        collected by RainbowNation may be combined with information obtained 
        from other RainbowNation services and other companies.<br><br>
        If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service, we will 
        collect additional personal information, including your credit card 
        number and billing address, in order to create a RainbowNation billing 
        account.<br><br>
        Some RainbowNation services, such as Forums, Blogs or Groups, request 
        that you create a social nickname, which is the name you will be known 
        by to others in those public places. You may select a different social 
        nickname at any time. You can also choose to create an optional public 
        profile, containing information about yourself - such as your hobbies 
        and interests. Any information you choose to enter in your public 
        profile will be visible to other users of RainbowNation sites and 
        services; and when you interact with other users (for example, sending 
        an email message to another email account or interacting in a 
        RainbowNation Forum), a link to your public profile may be displayed. 
        Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through 
        these public online forums, this information may be collected and used 
        by others. RainbowNation cautions you against&nbsp;providing personal 
        information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal or 
        harmful purposes.<br><br>
        RainbowNation keeps track of the pages our customers visit within 
        RainbowNation, in order to determine what RainbowNation sites and 
        services are the most popular.<br><br>
        RainbowNation also collects certain information about your computer 
        hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, 
        browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site 
        addresses.<br><br>
        Certain RainbowNation services may be co-branded and offered in 
        conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such 
        services, both RainbowNation and the other company may receive 
        information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.<br><br>
        <h1>Use of your Personal Information</h1>
        RainbowNation and its operational service partners collect and use 
        your personal information to operate RainbowNation and deliver the 
        services you have requested. These services may include the display of 
        customized content and advertising based upon the information 
        RainbowNation has collected. RainbowNation does not use or disclose 
        sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political 
        affiliations, without your explicit consent.<br><br>
        RainbowNation also uses your personal information to inform you of 
        other products or services available from RainbowNation and its 
        affiliates. RainbowNation may also contact you via surveys to conduct 
        research about your opinion of current services or of potential new 
        services that may be offered.<br><br>
        RainbowNation does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to 
        third parties. RainbowNation may, from time to time, contact you on 
        behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that 
        may be of interest to you. In those cases, your personal information 
        (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the 
        third party. <br><br>
        We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on 
        our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, 
        providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing 
        statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those 
        companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. 
        They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information 
        and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br><br>
        RainbowNation may access and/or disclose your personal information if 
        required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is 
        necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal 
        process served on RainbowNation or the site; (b) protect and defend the 
        rights or property of RainbowNation, including its RainbowNation family 
        of Web sites; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the 
        personal safety of users of RainbowNation services or members of the 
        public.<br><br>
        Personal information collected on this site may be stored and 
        processed in the United States or any other country in which 
        RainbowNation or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain 
        facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of 
        information outside of your country. RainbowNation abides by the safe 
        harbour framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
        regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European 
        Union.<br><br>
        <h2>Control of your Personal Information</h2>
        RainbowNation offers its customers choices for the collection, use 
        and sharing of personal information. You may choose not to receive 
        marketing material from RainbowNation or on behalf of external third 
        party business partners. You may also stop the delivery of future 
        promotional e-mail from RainbowNation by following the specific 
        instructions in the e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to 
        stop receiving such e-mails.<br><br>
        There are some RainbowNation services, that send out periodic e-mails 
        informing you of technical service issues, product surveys, new feature 
        announcements and news about RainbowNation products and services. You 
        will not be able to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are 
        considered a part of the service you have chosen.<br><br>
        You may subscribe and unsubscribe to RainbowNation Newsletters and 
        each RainbowNation newsletter you receive will have instructions on how 
        to unsubscribe prominently mentioned in it.<br><br>
        <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>
        RainbowNation is committed to protecting the security of your 
        personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and 
        procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized 
        access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal 
        information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which 
        are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly 
        confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the 
        Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the 
        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br><br>
        <h2>Collection and Use of Children's Personal 
        Information</h2>
        The RainbowNation site is intended for users of all ages. Children 
        may visit these general audience areas of RainbowNation and provide 
        personal information, which will be collected, used and disclosed as 
        described is this Privacy Statement. Some, but not all, RainbowNation 
        sites require users to provide age information. For those users who 
        visit such sites and identify themselves as under 13, RainbowNation will 
        not collect any of their information.<br><br>
        <b>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use such 
        general audience communication services your child will be able to 
        communicate with other users of all ages. Before providing consent, 
        please be aware that such services will give your child the ability to 
        disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone 
        numbers) on his or her own.</b> We encourage you to talk with your 
        children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal 
        information online. <br><br>
        <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
        RainbowNation uses "cookies" to help you personalise your online 
        experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by 
        a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver 
        viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can 
        only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to 
        you.<br><br>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
        feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize 
        RainbowNation's pages, or register with RainbowNation sites or services, 
        a cookie helps RainbowNation to recall your specific information on 
        subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your 
        personal information, such as billing addresses, preferred email 
        address, and so on. When you return to RainbowNation, the information 
        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
        RainbowNation features that you customised.<br><br>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline 
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive 
        features of the RainbowNation services or Web sites you visit. <br><br>
        <h2>Use of Web Beacons</h2>
        RainbowNation Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web 
        beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow RainbowNation 
        to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded 
        services. RainbowNation may include web beacons in promotional e-mail 
        messages or RainbowNation Newsletters in order to count how many 
        messages have been opened and acted upon.<br><br>
        Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a 
        cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the 
        page on which the Web beacon resides. RainbowNation Web pages may also 
        contain Web beacons placed there by third parties in order to compile 
        aggregated statistics and&nbsp;to help determine the effectiveness of our 
        joint promotional or advertising campaigns. RainbowNation prohibits web 
        beacons from being used to access your personal information.<br><br>
        <h2>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</h2>
        The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on 
        RainbowNation Web pages are displayed by RainbowNation.<br><br>
        In addition, RainbowNation allows other companies, called third-party 
        ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on RainbowNation Web pages. 
        Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your 
        computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognise your computer 
        each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad 
        networks may compile information about where you, or others who are 
        using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads 
        are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
        targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to 
        you. RainbowNation does not have access to or control of the cookies that 
        may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.<br><br>
        <h2>Changes to this Statement</h2>
        RainbowNation will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to 
        reflect company and customer feedback. If there are material changes to 
        this Statement or in how RainbowNation will use your personal 
        information, RainbowNation will prominently post such changes prior to 
        implementing the change. RainbowNation encourages you to periodically 
        review this Statement to be informed of how RainbowNation is protecting 
        your information.<br><br><br></td>
