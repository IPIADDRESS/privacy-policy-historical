<h1>Your Privacy on Rainbow Nation</h1>
<div class="YouAreHere">[last updated: November 2006]</div>
		<br>
		RainbowNation is committed to protecting your privacy. This 
		RainbowNation Privacy Statement applies to data collection and usage&nbsp;on 
		RainbowNation sites and services; it does not apply to other online or 
		offline RainbowNation sites, products or services. Please read the 
		RainbowNation Privacy Statement below and also any supplementary 
		information at the end of this statement for additional details about 
		particular RainbowNation sites and services that you may use.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation is a general audience web site, intended for users of all 
		ages. Personal information of all users is collected, used and disclosed 
		as described in this Privacy Statement. This Statement contains a 
		section with specific details regarding personal information collected 
		from children. Click <a href="#CHILDREN">here</a> 
		to read more.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
		At some sites, RainbowNation collects personal information, such as your 
		e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. 
		RainbowNation may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP 
		code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favourites. Information 
		collected by RainbowNation may be combined with information obtained 
		from other RainbowNation services and other companies.<br>
		<br>
		If you choose to sign up for a paid subscription service, we will 
		collect additional personal information, including your credit card 
		number and billing address, in order to create a RainbowNation billing 
		account.<br>
		<br>
		Some RainbowNation services, such as Forums, Blogs or Groups, request 
		that you create a social nickname, which is the name you will be known 
		by to others in those public places. You may select a different social 
		nickname at any time. You can also choose to create an optional public 
		profile, containing information about yourself - such as your hobbies 
		and interests. Any information you choose to enter in your public 
		profile will be visible to other users of RainbowNation sites and 
		services; and when you interact with other users (for example, sending 
		an email message to another email account or interacting in a 
		RainbowNation Forum), a link to your public profile may be displayed. 
		Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through 
		these public online forums, this information may be collected and used 
		by others. RainbowNation cautions you against&nbsp;providing personal 
		information to strangers online, which they may use for illegal or 
		harmful purposes.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation keeps track of the pages our customers visit within 
		RainbowNation, in order to determine what RainbowNation sites and 
		services are the most popular.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation also collects certain information about your computer 
		hardware and software. This information may include: your IP address, 
		browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site 
		addresses.<br>
		<br>
		Certain RainbowNation services may be co-branded and offered in 
		conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such 
		services, both RainbowNation and the other company may receive 
		information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
		RainbowNation and its operational service partners collect and use your 
		personal information to operate RainbowNation and deliver the services 
		you have requested. These services may include the display of customized 
		content and advertising based upon the information RainbowNation has 
		collected. RainbowNation does not use or disclose sensitive personal 
		information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without 
		your explicit consent.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation also uses your personal information to inform you of other 
		products or services available from RainbowNation and its affiliates. 
		RainbowNation may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about 
		your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may 
		be offered.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third 
		parties. RainbowNation may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of 
		external business partners about a particular offering that may be of 
		interest to you. In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, 
		name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
		<br>
		<br>
		We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our 
		behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, 
		providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing 
		statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those 
		companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. 
		They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information 
		and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
		<br>
		RainbowNation may access and/or disclose your personal information if 
		required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is 
		necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal 
		process served on RainbowNation or the site; (b) protect and defend the 
		rights or property of RainbowNation, including its RainbowNation family 
		of Web sites; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the 
		personal safety of users of RainbowNation services or members of the 
		public.<br>
		<br>
		Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed 
		in the United States or any other country in which RainbowNation or its 
		affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using 
		this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of 
		your country. RainbowNation abides by the safe harbour framework as set 
		forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, 
		and retention of data from the European Union.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Control of your Personal Information</h3>
		RainbowNation offers its customers choices for the collection, use and 
		sharing of personal information. You may choose not to receive marketing 
		material from RainbowNation or on behalf of external third party 
		business partners. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional 
		e-mail from RainbowNation by following the specific instructions in the 
		e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such 
		e-mails.<br>
		<br>
		There are some RainbowNation services, that send out periodic e-mails 
		informing you of technical service issues, product surveys, new feature 
		announcements and news about RainbowNation products and services. You 
		will not be able to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are 
		considered a part of the service you have chosen.<br>
		<br>
		You may subscribe and unsubscribe to RainbowNation Newsletters and each 
		RainbowNation newsletter you receive will have instructions on how to 
		unsubscribe prominently mentioned in it.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
		RainbowNation is committed to protecting the security of your personal 
		information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to 
		help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or 
		disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide 
		on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled 
		facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a 
		credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of 
		encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
		<br>		<a name="children"></a>
		<h3>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h3>
		The RainbowNation site is intended for users of all ages. Children may 
		visit these general audience areas of RainbowNation and provide personal 
		information, which will be collected, used and disclosed as described is 
		this Privacy Statement. Some, but not all, RainbowNation sites require 
		users to provide age information. For those users who visit such sites 
		and identify themselves as under 13, RainbowNation will not collect any 
		of their information.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use such 
		general audience communication services your child will be able to 
		communicate with other users of all ages. Before providing consent, 
		please be aware that such services will give your child the ability to 
		disclose personal information (e.g. name, address, e-mail, phone 
		numbers) on his or her own.</b><br><br> We encourage you to talk with your 
		children about the issues surrounding with communicating with strangers and disclosing personal 
		information online. <br>
		<br>
		<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
		RainbowNation uses "cookies" to help you personalise your online 
		experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by 
		a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver 
		viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can 
		only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to 
		you.<br>
		<br>
		One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
		feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize 
		RainbowNation's pages, or register with RainbowNation sites or services, 
		a cookie helps RainbowNation to recall your specific information on 
		subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your 
		personal information, such as billing addresses, preferred email 
		address, and so on. When you return to RainbowNation, the information 
		you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the 
		RainbowNation features that you customised.<br>
		<br>
		You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
		automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
		setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline 
		cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive 
		features of the RainbowNation services or Web sites you visit. <br>
		<br>
		<h3>Use of Web Beacons</h3>
		RainbowNation Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web 
		beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow RainbowNation 
		to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded 
		services. RainbowNation may include web beacons in promotional e-mail 
		messages or RainbowNation Newsletters in order to count how many 
		messages have been opened and acted upon.<br>
		<br>
		Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie 
		number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on 
		which the Web beacon resides. RainbowNation Web pages may also contain 
		Web beacons placed there by third parties in order to compile aggregated 
		statistics and&nbsp;to help determine the effectiveness of our joint 
		promotional or advertising campaigns. RainbowNation prohibits web 
		beacons from being used to access your personal information.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</h3>
		The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on 
		RainbowNation Web pages are displayed by RainbowNation.<br>
		<br>
		In addition, RainbowNation allows other companies, called third-party ad 
		servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on RainbowNation Web 
		pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your 
		computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognise your computer 
		each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad 
		networks may compile information about where you, or others who are 
		using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads 
		are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
		targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to 
		you. RainbowNation does not have access to or control of the cookies 
		that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>
		RainbowNation will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect 
		company and customer feedback. If there are material changes to this 
		Statement or in how RainbowNation will use your personal information, 
		RainbowNation will prominently post such changes prior to implementing 
		the change. RainbowNation encourages you to periodically review this 
		Statement to be informed of how RainbowNation is protecting your 
		information.<br><br>
