    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2><strong>Last  Updated: August 5th, 2013</strong></h2>
    <p>RAIDS.COM knows your privacy is very important. From  time to time, we may change our privacy policy and thus we urge you to re-check  this page on a constant basis to ensure that you know if and what these changes  are. By continuing to use any part of the RAIDS.COM website after any  changes to this policy have been made, you are agreeing to any and all changes  made.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>RAIDS.COM ("RAIDS.COM") considers your  privacy to be of utmost importance.This privacy policy has been adapted from  two policies: Google Adsense (Google Inc.) and Automattic (WordPress.com).This  privacy policy is under the creative commons sharealike license. Please read  and consider this notice very closely.</p>
    <p>Website  Users</p>
    <p>RAIDS.COM, as most website operators do,  collects non-personally-identifying information in a manner that web browsers  and servers generally make available. This non-personally-identifying  information pertains to, but is not limited to: what kind of browser, language  preference, referring site, date and time of each visit (and visitor),  demographics of every visitor, whether a visitor is new to the site or not, and  operating system. We, RAIDS.COM, use this information we gather to better  understand our audience, and thus improve the website through new and desired  updates and changes. RAIDS.COM may publish information to the public regarding  the usage of its website, such as in the form of reported trends of statistics  of the website. However, RAIDS.COM will never release  personally-identifying information such as your Internet Protocol address (IP  Address). </p>
  <p>Again, RAIDS.COM does not use personally-identifying  information of its visitors as described above, and does not disclose such  information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses  personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
    <h2>Collection  of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Many users of RAIDS.COM’ websites make the choice to  interact with RAIDS.COM in ways that require RAIDS.COM to aggregate  personally-identifying information. The amount or type of information that is  necessary depends on the kind of interaction. One example is that we ask  visitors who create an account with RAIDS.COM to provide an email address  and unique username. In each and every situation, RAIDS.COM collects such  information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose  of the visitor’s interaction with RAIDS.COM. RAIDS.COM does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors are  free to deny RAIDS.COM’ access to any personally-identifying information but  must understand that it may hinder them from participating in specific  website-related activities.</p>
    <h2>Aggregated  Statistics</h2>
    <p>RAIDS.COM may gather and examine statistics  pertaining to the actions of visitors to its websites. As a couple examples, RAIDS.COM  may monitor the most visited posts or the most commented on images. RAIDS.COM  may publicly display this information on its websites or share it with others  in various forms. RAIDS.COM does not disclose personally-identifying  information other than described below.</p>
    <h2>Protection  of Specific Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>9GAG discloses potentially personally-identifying  and personally-identifying information only to its employees, contractors and  affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to  process it on RAIDS.COM’ behalf or to provide services available at RAIDS.COM’s  websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. </p>
    <p>Some of the employees, contractors and affiliated  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using RAIDS.COM’  websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <br>
      In some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In this type of transaction, user information is typically one of the business  assets transferred. If RAIDS.COM, or all of its assets, were acquired, or in  the unlikely event that RAIDS.COM goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,  user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by  a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any new  owner of RAIDS.COM may continue to use your personal and non-personal  information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, RAIDS.COM will not  rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying  information to anyone.</p>
    <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and  affiliated organizations, as described above, RAIDS.COM discloses potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required  to do so by law, or when RAIDS.COM believes in good faith that disclosure is  reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of RAIDS.COM, third  parties or the public at large. </p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of a RAIDS.COM website  and have supplied your email address, RAIDS.COM may occasionally send you an  email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or to simply keep  you updated with company and/or website changes. If you send us a request (for  example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve  the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request  or to help us support other users. RAIDS.COM takes all measures required to  protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of  potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
    <p>It is important to be aware that if you submit  information to “message boards,” “forums,” or “chat rooms,” such information  becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might  have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your  chances of receiving unwanted communications (also known as SPAM).</p>

More detailed information about cookie management with specific web browsers  can be found at the browsers’ respective websites.</p>
    <h2>Links  to Third Parties</h2>

This privacy policy does not apply to  the practices of companies that RAIDS.COM does not own or control, or employees  that RAIDS.COM does not manage.
