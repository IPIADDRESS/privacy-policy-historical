      <h4>Definitions</h4>
      <p>‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.
        ‘Personal data’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data
        subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to
        an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
        factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that
        natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader
        in scope and covers more data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A “visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “member” is someone who has registered with us for a
        free account, or to buy our services and products. The term “user” is a collective identifier that refers to
        either a visitor or a member.</p>

      <h4><i>Google Analytics Privacy Notice</i></h4>
      <p>Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics
        collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our website,
        what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use the
        information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users,
        improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. We have enabled Google Analytics advertising
        features such as remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google
        Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
        the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the
        information collected using Google Analytics with PD. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on
        your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie cannot be used
        by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about the use of our
        website. For more information on how Google collects and processes your data, visit
        <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>
        You can prevent Google Analytics from using your information by opting out at this link:

      <h4><i>Other Analytics Companies</i></h4>
      <p>We also use other companies for analytics and collecting user tracking data. These companies include but are
        not limited to Kissmetrics.com, Facebook.com, Unbounce.com, and LinkedIn.com.</p>

      <h4><i>Google Remarketing</i></h4>
      <p>Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
        Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other
        companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products
        you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not
        buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website’s owner might like to encourage you to revisit
        his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use
        remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your browser,
        or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. You can opt out
        of Google’s use of cookies and remarketing at this
        link: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a>
        or
        you can opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page

      <h4><i>Facebook Remarketing</i></h4>
      <p>Third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or
        receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide
        measurement services and target ads. With Facebook remarketing you may see our ads on Facebook after you have
        visited our site. For this to happen, Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor
        lands on a webpage and a unique “cookie” is placed in their browser. Facebook lookalike audience targeting
        allows us to show ads on Facebook to people who are similar to those who have already visited or made a purchase
        from our website. To opt out of Facebook’s collection and use of information for ad targeting visit:

        safeguards to protect your PD. When we collect your credit card information through our website, we will encrypt
        it before it travels over the Internet using industry-standard technology for conducting secure online
        transactions. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee against the loss or misuse of your PD or secure data

      <h4>Transferring PD From the European Union</h4>

      <p>(PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the countries in which
        we operate, specifically the United States. The European Union has not found the United States and some other
        countries to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on

        other countries. We will use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to
        perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not
        outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps
        to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using
        our website, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.</p>

        different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to the
        email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in
        agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued use
        of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance
        of such change.</p>
