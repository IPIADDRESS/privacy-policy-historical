<br><br>

</p><p><a name="Application"><b>Application</b></a>.  This policy applies to residents of the United States and hotels of our Brands located in the United States only.  We do not accept the jurisdiction of any other laws over our activities in the United States.  This policy also applies only to our Brand guests, prospective guests and visitors to the consumer web sites of our Brands.  We have a separate policy governing our extranet sites accessible only to our Franchisees.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Purpose"><b>Purpose</b></a>.  Our purpose in establishing this policy is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using Information with our Customers' reasonable expectations of privacy.  Our intent is to bring you offers and discounts that we believe are relevant to your interests.  We believe that our Customers benefit from promotional activity based on Customer Information employed to market goods and services offered by and through our franchise systems and other Wyndham Worldwide business units. For more information on our affiliates, check our corporate web site, www.wyndhamworldwide.com.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Security"><b>Security</b></a>. Wyndham Worldwide collects Information only in a manner deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes and comply with our legal obligations.
</p><p>
We safeguard our Customers' personally identifiable information by using industry standard practices.  Although "guaranteed security" does not exist either on or off the Internet, we make commercially reasonable efforts to make our collection of such Information consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
</p><p>
Currently, our websites utilize a variety of different security measures designed to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users both inside and outside Wyndham Worldwide, including the use of 128-bit encryption based on a Class 3 Digital Certificate issued by Verisign Inc. This allows for utilization of Secure Sockets Layer, which is a method for encrypting data. This protects confidential information - such as credit card numbers, online forms, and financial data - from loss, misuse, interception and hacking.
</p><p>
We take commercially reasonable efforts to create and maintain "fire walls" and other appropriate safeguards to ensure that to the extent Wyndham Worldwide controls the Information, the Information is used only as authorized by Wyndham Worldwide and consistent with this Policy, and that the Information is not improperly altered or destroyed. Our privacy protection practices help us to maintain accurate, timely, complete and relevant information for our business purposes. Our communication system, software and database practices have been designed to aid us in supporting authenticity, integrity and confidentiality.  Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain data security when data is transmitted through third party communication service providers, we do not warrant the security of data during such transmission.
</p><p>
Third party websites that are accessed through links, banners and other means of electronic connection on our web sites have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no control over these third party web sites and no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their websites. These third party web sites have content, advertising, banners, links, sponsors, partners and connections over which we have no control and no responsibility.  We encourage you to contact these third parties to ask questions about their terms of use, privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing personal information on linked web sites.  We do not endorse or approve the content, terms of use, privacy policy, advertising or sponsors of any linked web site.
</p><p>
Please click on this link Feedback/Opt out to give us your feedback about this Policy or opt out of further communications from us.


<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Internet"><b>The Internet</b></a>.  On our Brand web sites we do not collect personally identifiable information from Customers unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. When you reserve a room with us we will capture information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number to process your reservation.  The primary purpose of capturing the email address is to send a reservation confirmation to the reserving guest.  The confirmation may contain additional offers from our affiliates and business partners that we believe may be of interest to you, based on the information you provide to us.  However, Customers can sign up to receive email offers from the Brand and select third party partners.  If you have asked to be put on our mailing lists, we may contact you via e-mail from time to time.  You will always be provided with a way to opt-out of future e-mailings, however we will continue to send e-mails to confirm your reservations.
</p><p>
Like many other Internet sites, we automatically collect certain non-personal information regarding our Customers, such as software client information (for example, IP addresses, browser versions and operating systems) and aggregate information (for example, number of pages accessed) in order to analyze Web traffic and usage trends, and to enable us to tailor content and services to provide a better fit to our Customers' needs. Information of this nature does not pertain to your specific identity and is not associated with your personal information.
</p><p>
Our web sites have hyperlinks that connect the Customer to other websites, some of which are not affiliated with or controlled by Wyndham Worldwide. Once you leave our websites, each new website you visit may have its own privacy policy and terms of use. Your interaction with these sites will not be governed by this policy or the terms of use of our web sites.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Cookies"><b>Cookies</b></a>. We may place a "cookie" on your web browser.  A cookie is a very small text file that is sent to a Customer's browser from a web server and stored on the Customer's computer hard drive. It assigns the computer a unique identifier.  The cookie stores information on your hard drive so we can communicate with you more efficiently, respond to you based on prior sessions at which you provided information about you or your preferences to us and understand what you prefer to view on our web sites.   We do not use cookies to store passwords or credit card information.  Cookies do not tell us your individual identity unless you have chosen to provide it to us.
</p><p>
Your browser may be set to allow you to be notified when a cookie is to be placed on your browser, decline the cookie or delete cookies that have been placed on your browser. Some functions of our web sites may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused.
</p><p>
Our web site uses third party service providers to serve and host our advertisements. These third parties may place cookies on your computer if you click on or access the advertising.
</p><p>
The third party cookies are used to track whether the site was accessed from the advertisement. The cookies generated from the advertisements do not contain personally identifiable information.  We do not control these cookies and they may not follow the rules we have set for our own cookies.
</p><p>
We and our third party ad server also use invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, on our web site to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate without the use of a Customer's personally identifiable information. This information may be used to improve marketing programs and content and to target our Internet advertisements on our site and other web sites.  For more information about our third party ad server, or to learn your choices about not having this non-personal information used to serve ads to you, please click here.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Information"><b>The Information We Collect</b></a>.  Each hotel operated by a Brand franchisee must collect and store Customers' names, addresses, and other basic Information that is solicited on the hotel registration card to provide requested hotel services and for billing purposes. State laws in many states require the hotel operator to collect and retain this information and make it available to law enforcement officers. Our franchisees send to the Wyndham Worldwide Enterprise Data Warehouse certain personally identifiable information, including the name, address, telephone number, email address and transaction detail (what goods and services were charged on the hotel bill and the method of payment). In addition, we obtain personally identifiable information from third party sources that are obligated to comply with applicable privacy laws. We may append such information to Information maintained in the Wyndham Worldwide Enterprise Data Warehouse. Credit card numbers used for payment or guarantee are automatically encrypted in our Data Warehouse so that they cannot be easily accessed. We do not collect Social Security or driver's license numbers from Customers.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Feedback"><b>Feedback/Opt out</b></a>.  We always offer Customers the opportunity to "opt-out" of communications.   A customer may elect to opt out of communication by following the directions posted on every email communication or by visiting the brand website or by contacting the customer service department of the hotel Brand that was patronized.  Customers can elect to opt out from any of the following: (1) Mail - email (excluding confirmation emails) and direct mail; (2) Phone -telephone and fax solicitation; or (3) Contact - all communications including email, direct mail, fax and telephone.  We maintain telephone "do not call" lists as mandated by law.  We incorporate into our Data Warehouse  "do not call" and "do not mail" lists maintained by other organizations.   We process requests to be placed on do not mail, do not phone and do not contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.

</p><p>We also invite your feedback and comments on this Policy.  Please contact us at the email address above or by writing to us at:  Privacy Policy Inquiry, Hotel Group, 1 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, NJ 07054.  You may also call our Customer Service Departments through our Brand telephone reservation centers or at the numbers provided above.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Reservations"><b>Reservations</b></a>. When a Customer calls our reservation centers or contacts us via the Internet, fax or other means about hotel reservations, we need certain information such as name, address, telephone number and email address to respond to the inquiry and to make the reservation. This information is sent to the hotel where the reservation is also recorded. A credit card number is necessary to guarantee the reservation past a certain time. The franchisee will charge the credit card account of a Customer who fails to arrive and fails to cancel the reservation in a timely manner. Franchisees may impose other conditions on the reservation such as minimum length of stay, advance deposit and other terms of the contract. A Customer should always ask for and record a confirmation number when making, changing or canceling a reservation. Information collected as part of the reservation process is used as this Policy describes whether or not the Customer actually utilizes the hotel reservation.  The Franchisor may, but is under no obligation to, contact Customers with reservations to inform them about changes in the status of the hotel for which the reservations are made and may suggest alternative accommodations.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Email"><b>Email</b></a>. Each Franchisor will ask Customers to submit their email address to provide relevant information such as reservation confirmations and special offers.   The primary purpose of capturing email addresses is to send reservation confirmations to our guests.  Our confirmations may contain additional offers from our affiliates and business partners based on information you provide and your destination.  However, Customers can also sign up to receive email offers from the Brand and selected third party partners.  In addition, we may collect Customer email addresses and share them with our third party service providers for purposes of conducting consumer research and surveys as more fully described below.  Customers will always have the ability to opt-out of future email communications, however, we will continue to send e-mails to confirm your reservations.

It is our intent to only send email communication (other than confirmation e-mails) to Customers who have consented to receive email from the Brand or our carefully selected third party partners, and/or to Customers who have permitted third parties to share the Customer's e-mail address with entities such as the Brands for purposes of receiving promotional e-mails. These communications will relate to Brand offers, Customer surveys, and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties whom we have a marketing relationship because they offer products and/or services that may be of interest to you.  At any time a Customer may opt-out of receiving email communications by following the directions posted in every email communication, by visiting the Brand web site and following the opt-out instructions or by contacting the Brand's Customer Service Department.

We currently use a third party email service provider to send emails.  This service provider is prohibited from using our Customer's email address for any purpose other than to send Brand related email.


<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Sweepstakes"><b>SWEEPSTAKES / CONTESTS</b></a>:

</p><p>Occasionally a Franchisor runs sweepstakes and contests. We use Information provided for hotel reservations or ask Customers who participate or enter to provide contact information (like an email address). If a Customer participates in a sweepstakes or contest, his/her contact information may be used to reach him/her about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.
</p><p>
All Brand sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt-out of any communication from the sweepstake's/contest's manager that is not related to awarding prizes for the sweepstake/contest.


<br><br>
</p><p><a name="DirectMail"><b>DIRECT MAIL / OUTBOUND TELEMARKETING</b></a>:

</p><p>Customers who supply a Brand with Information, or whose Information we obtain from third parties may receive periodic mailings or phone calls from us with information on new Brand products and services or upcoming Brand special offers/events. They may also receive mailings/calls from third parties we select whom we believe offer potentially valuable goods or services.
</p><p>
Each Franchisor offers our Customers the option to decline these communications. Customers may contact us to opt-out of such communications as follows:

</p><p>By email, <a href="privacy_policy_inquiry_form">click here to opt out</a>.

</p><p>By phone - 888-564-4487 for Amerihost Inn; 877-212-2733 for Days Inn; 877-222-3297 for Howard Johnson; 877-225-5637 for Knights Inn; 877-227-3557 for Ramada Inn; 877-244-7633 for Super 8; 877-321-7653 for Travelodge; 877-333-6683 for Wingate by Wyndham; 800-870-3936 for Baymont Inn

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Research"><b>RESEARCH/SURVEY SOLICITATIONS</b></a>
</p><p>From time to time we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf.  All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will only be used for research and reporting purposes, to help us to better serve Customers by learning more about their needs and the quality of guest experience at all of our hotels. We may contact a Customer to inquire or survey about the guest experience at the Brand visited and the prospect of future stays or the improvements needed to attract additional business from the Customer for the hotel visited or the Franchisor.  The survey responses may also be used to determine the effectiveness of our websites, various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities.
</p><p>
If a Customer participates in a survey, the information given by the Customer will be used along with that of other study participants (for example, a Franchisor might report that 50% of a survey's respondents are men).  A Franchisor may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.
</p><p>
Participation in surveys is voluntary. Participants who do not wish to receive email communications may opt out of the receipt of such communication by notifying us as provided in the Feedback/Opt-Out section below.

<br><br>
</p><p><a name="Individual"><b>What is Individual Specific Information</b></a>? Individual-specific or personally identifiable information is any information or data about a Customer that in itself, or as part of a unique combination of information, specifically recognizes the Customer by a unique identifier or descriptor.   Examples of individual-specific include name, address, telephone number, email address, employment status, credit card type and number, and other financial information.
<br><br>
</p><p><a name="dont"><b>What We Won't Do With Customer Information</b></a>. The Wyndham Hotel Group and the Franchisors will not:
</p><ol>
<li> Sell or rent Information to parties outside the Wyndham Worldwide family of companies (not including businesses that entered into long term contracts with the hotel chains to obtain Customer Information while a part of the Wyndham Worldwide family and which later leave the family), our franchisees and affiliates, or allow Wyndham Worldwide affiliates to sell or rent the Information to parties outside the Wyndham Worldwide family of companies, franchisees and affiliates;

</li><li> Maintain in our Enterprise Data Warehouse any Information about any Customer on billing, collection or payment disputes with any franchisee, creditor or Wyndham Worldwide affiliate;
</li></ol>

<br><br>

<p><a name="Franchisees"><b>Our Franchisees</b></a>.  Each Brand hotel is owned and operated by an independent franchisee that is neither owned nor controlled by Wyndham Worldwide, a Franchisor or any other Wyndham Worldwide subsidiary. Each franchisee collects Customer Information and uses the Information for its own purposes. Wyndham Worldwide does not control the use of this Information or access to the Information by the franchisee and its associates. The franchisee is the merchant who collects and processes credit card information and receives payment for the hotel services. The franchisee is subject to the merchant rules of the credit card processors it selects, which establish its card security rules and procedures.  This policy does not apply to a franchisee's web site.  Franchisees may also use email campaigns and other methods of telephone, electronic, and direct mail solicitation without our consent or knowledge and are solely responsible for their content and methods of identifying and contacting addressees.

</p><p><a name="Law"><b>Other Disclosures</b></a>.   We may be obligated to disclose Information about you to a law enforcement agency or by a court order, or under the discovery process in litigation, investigations, and prosecutions.  We may provide Information to assist a Franchisee to enforce a contact you may have breached.  We may ask certain questions in the reservation booking process to comply with certain laws if you reside outside the United States or meet certain other criteria established by law or executive order.  Unless otherwise prohibited by law or our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or in good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable.  Situations may include: to perform, maintain or enforce contracts with our Customers, to protect the rights or properties of our Franchisees, affiliates and business partners, our Customers or others, or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing or who may be threatening to cause interference with or damage to our rights properties, or the hotels in our Brands, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
