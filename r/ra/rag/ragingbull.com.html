      <p>Protecting Your Personal Privacy</p>
      </b> 
      <p>When visiting ragingbull.com, we want you to be assured that we would 
        never compromise your personal privacy or share your personal information 
        with anyone without first gaining your permission. We have created this 
        statement so you will know why we gather data, how we gather data and 
        what we do with the collected data.</p>
      <p>Raging Bull is a free website and the majority of our revenues are derived 
        from advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers, we aggregate 
        all personal demographic data and provide the results to advertisers so 
        that they will understand the value of Raging Bull's members as an aggregated 
        advertising audience.</p>
      <p>We understand that our number one asset is our members and we will never 
        knowingly do anything to harm the trust you have bestowed on us.</p>
      <b> 
      <p>Gathering of Information </p>
      </b> 
      <p>We gather information in two ways: Voluntary Submission and "Cookies."</p>
      <i><u> 
      <p>Voluntary Submission</p>
      </u></i> 
      <p>When you become a member of Raging Bull, or subscribe to our newsletters, 
        we ask you a series of general demographic questions. We then compile 
        the information that you provide us with the information other members 
        provide us and make the compiled result available to our advertisers and 
        partners. The information that you supply when you first access Real Time 
        Quotes is required by the New York Stock Exchange and will be kept confidential, 
        unless requested by an Exchange or pursuant to a valid subpoena. </p>
      <i><u> 
      <p>Cookies </p>
      </u></i> 
      <p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard 
        drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such 
        as a member ID, which the site uses to track the pages you've visited. 
        But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
        you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read 
        cookie files created by other sites. </p>
      <p>We use cookies to track member traffic patterns throughout all of our 
        sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual 
        members. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a member's 
        domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from 
        the browser string (information contained in every member's browser). 
      </p>
      <p>We also use cookies to identify you as a Raging Bull member so you don't 
        have to log on each time you visit our site, and to visit member-restricted 
        areas of the sites. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Uses of Information</p>
      </b> 
      <p>We use any information voluntarily you give us to enhance your experience 
        in our site, which is to provide you with interactive or personalized 
        elements on the sites and to better prepare future content based on your 
        interests. </p>
      <p>We aggregate this tracking information to determine which areas of our 
        site members like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We don't 
        track what individual members read, but rather how well each page performs 
        overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. </p>
      <p>We also use the information that is gathered to tailor our content to 
        suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's 
        demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free.</p>
