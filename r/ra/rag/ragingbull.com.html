								store information that you voluntarily provide when using
								the Websites and the Services. For example, when you
								subscribe to our Services, we require you to provide
								personal information including your name, postal address,
								email address, telephone number, facsimile number, company
								affiliation, and other basic contact information. You may
								also provide additional personal information to us when you
								voluntarily communicate with us, such as when you request
								information, register for email updates or listen to a
								webcast, submit application for employment, or when you
								post information to the user content portion of the
								Websites. <br> <br> b) In addition to the
								information you voluntarily provide to us, we automatically
								record information from your Internet browser, including
								your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your
								computer's name, the type and version of your web browser,
								the Internet addresses of the sites from which you access
								the Websites (referring addresses) and other
								generally-accepted log information. We may also record the

								other statistical and tracking information, which are
								aggregated with website utilization information from other
								users in order to understand how our Websites are being

								<br> c) While accessing and operating an RagingBull.com
								product, the Sherwood Ventures, LLC software may record
								general statistical and tracking information, such as the

								time spent using it. The RagingBull.com software transfers this
								information to RagingBull.com's servers, and such information is
								used exclusively for internal resource management purposes.
								<br> <br> d) Cookies. We use common website
								management technologies called cookies. A cookie is a small
								data file, which often includes a unique but
								non-identifying code that is sent to your browser from a
								website's computers and stored on your computer's hard
								drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored
								user experience and to make it easier for you to use the
								Websites upon a future visit. RagingBull.com will also use
								cookies to recognize you when you return to our Websites.
								Our cookies are "persistent," or permanent, cookies, since
								they remain on your computer after you end your visit, or
								"session," on our Websites. Most web browsers are set to
								accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable
								the cookies feature of your browser. You should review the
								online documentation of your browser or consult with the
								provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable
								cookies. If you disable cookies on your computer, some
								parts of our Websites may not be available to you or may
								not function as intended. <br> <br> e) Referring
								Sites. Websites that contain links to our Websites are
								known as "referring sites." When you enter our Websites
								from a referring site, we automatically collect information
								that identifies the referring site and use this information
								to analyze which third party services send visitors to our
								Websites and to present appropriate content to our
								potential customers. Sherwood Ventures, LLC tabulates
								referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify
								Websites trends and traffic patterns.

    </p>
    <p>
    <b> <span> 12.1 What Information We Collect
						and Use</span></b><span> 
					<br>
						 In addition to the
					information set forth in Section 2 above, Sherwood Ventures, LLC
					 collects information from users at
					different points on our Sherwood Ventures, LLC
					Websites and through our software, as follows: 
					<br>
					<b>12.1.1 Registration</b>: In order to subscribe to
					RagingBull.com products and services, we require that you
					complete a registration form. This form may ask for
					contact information, such as name, address, email
					address, telephone number, company name, fax number
					and other basic contact information ("Registration
					Information"). After submitting your Registration
					Information, you can view and modify this information
					within the self-maintenance area of the RagingBull.com
					Websites. You agree to notify RagingBull.com of any change
					to your billing address within thirty (30) days of
					such change. 
					<br>
					 <b>12.1.2. Orders and
                         Requests</b>: When you subscribe to an RagingBull.com product
					or service, we request the appropriate billing
					information on our order form. This information
					includes your credit card number, expiration date and
					billing address ("Order Information"). Order
					Information is kept with your Registration Information
					in a database and will be retained for future
					purchases. <br> <b>12.1.3. Partners</b>: Sherwood Ventures, LLC
					 may enter into agreements with other
					companies that market software or services that either
					function similarly to RagingBull.com software or that
					enhance or extend RagingBull.com' functionality. Some of
					these may be third party products that may utilize
					components of RagingBull.com software. Under the terms of
					these agreements, we may be required to collect
					information about your sessions and your use of these
					third party products and share this information with
					these third parties. <br> <b>12.1.4. Third
                        Party Advertising Companies</b>: We use third-party
					advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our
					RagingBull.com Websites. These companies may use
					information (not including your name, address email
					address or telephone number) about your visits to this
					and other websites in order to provide advertisements
					about goods and services of interest to you.
					<br>
					<b>12.1.5.
                        Providers</b>: A provider is an entity that agrees to pay
					for the RagingBull.com services being provided to you. We
					have entered into contractual agreements with these
					providers governing the provider arrangement. Under
					the terms of these agreements, we may be required to
					collect information about your sessions and your use

					along with your personally identifiable information,
					with the provider paying for your Sherwood Ventures, LLC
					 service. This information is kept strictly
					confidential, and is not shared with other third
					parties, except as provided for in this Privacy
					Policy. 
					<br>
					<b>12.1.6 Access to Information</b>:
					If you are a resident of Australia, on request, we
					will provide you with access to personal information
					that we hold about you collected when you visit our
					Website or use our Services (unless there is an
					exception that applies under Australian privacy laws,
					such as where we have a legal duty of
					confidentiality). Your request to obtain access will
					be dealt with in a reasonable time. We may recover
					from you the reasonable cost of providing you with
					access.

					<b>
                        12.2 What We Do
                        with Information We Collect and Use</b>
					<br>
					In
					general, except as provided in this policy, we will
					not disclose your personally identifiable information
					to unaffiliated third parties without your express
					consent or allowing you to decline to permit the
					disclosure. There are, however, some limited
					circumstances, in addition to those set forth in
					section 3 above, in which we may need to disclose
					personally identifiable information about a user
					without express consent, including, but not limited
					to, the circumstances set forth below: <br> <b>12.2.1.
                        RagingBull.com Website Vendors</b>: We may employ other
					companies to perform functions on our behalf, such
					providing customer service, sending print and
					electronic mail, processing credit card payments, or
					other functions necessary to our business. In order to
					allow these companies to perform their obligations, we
					may need to share your personally identifiable
					information with them. However, we will provide these
					companies with only that information necessary to
					perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not
					allow them to use your personally identifiable
					information for any other purpose. 
					<br>
					 <b>12.2.2.
                         Resellers</b>: Sherwood Ventures, LLC may from time to
					time enter into agreements with companies that resell
					RagingBull.com' products or services, either on RagingBull.com'
					behalf, or on their own behalf on a private labeled
					basis and/or on a co-branded basis. Under the terms of
					these agreements, we may be required, and therefore we
					reserve the right, to share your personally
					identifiable information with such resellers. Once
					your personally identifiable information is provided
					to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by
					this privacy policy. In those instances, your
					personally identifiable information will be governed
					by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is
					provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RagingBull.com
					will not share your Order Information with any
					reseller that is not billing you directly for the
					re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded
					RagingBull.com services to which you subscribe. <br> <b>12.2.3.
                        RagingBull.com Publishers and Merchants</b>: RagingBull.com
					reserves the right to provide to publishers and other
					merchants for whom RagingBull.com sells or distributes
					products or services any personally identifiable
					information as is necessary to fulfill any requests
					you may make for their products or services. In
					addition, merchants of the products you purchase or to
					which you subscribe through RagingBull.com may request
					additional personally identifiable information from
					you. RagingBull.com will provide the merchants of such
					products the information you supply in response to
					those requests and, following such disclosure by
					RagingBull.com, your personally identifiable information
					will no longer be covered by this policy. In those
					instances, your personally identifiable information is
					governed by the privacy policy of the merchants whose
					products you have purchased or to which you have
					subscribed. 
					<br> 
					<b>12.2.4. Required by Law</b>:
					Sherwood Ventures, LLC will reveal your personally
					identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably
					believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive
					legal process calling for the disclosure of any of
					your personally identifiable information we will
					attempt to notify you via the email address you
					supplied during registration within a reasonable
					amount of time before we respond to the request,
					unless such notification is not permitted. <br> <br>
					<b>12.3 Changing or Removing Personal Information;
                        Opting Out</b>
					<br> 
					To ensure that you have
					appropriate control over your personally identifiable
					information, you can access your account (after
					supplying your user name and password) in the
					Self-Maintenance area of our RagingBull.com Websites to
					update and/or correct the information you have
					previously submitted. 
					<br> 
					In addition, we
					provide you with the ability to decline -- or "opt-out
					of" -- certain mailings and other materials we may
					offer. For these materials, you will be able to
					specify whether you wish to opt-out by following
					directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as
					further detailed in Section 11.4 (Communications to
					our Users) of our Privacy Policy, below. 
					<br>
					Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and
					other personally identifiable information from our
					active databases. Please understand, however, that it
					may be impossible to remove this information
					completely, due to backups and records of deletions.
					If you wish to remove your name and other personally
					identifiable information from our database, please
					create an email with the term "Unsubscribe" in the
					subject line, and send the email to the address listed
					in Section 11.9 of this Privacy Policy. As an
					alternative, you may write to us with your request, at
					the mailing address set forth in Section 11.9. You
					will be removed from our databases generally within
					ten business days of our receipt of your request. You
					may also request to review or amend any personal
					information that we maintain about you, by sending a
					written request to the same address, subject to our
					verification of your identity acceptance of any
					proposed revision. 
					<br> 
					<br> 
					
					<b>12.4
                        Communications to Our Users</b> <br>
					<b>12.4.1.
                        RagingBull.com</b>: RagingBull.com sends emails and/or postal
					mailings to new subscribers and to provide to existing
					subscribers information regarding their specific
					RagingBull.com products. Periodically, RagingBull.com will send
					news and information to subscribers and other parties
					who have expressed interest in RagingBull.com and its
					products. You can opt out of receiving these
					promotional communications through the
					Self-Maintenance area of our RagingBull.com Websites. For
					so long as you use Sherwood Ventures, LLC products and
					services or otherwise maintain a business relationship
					with RagingBull.com, however, you may not opt out of
					receiving communications from RagingBull.com relating
					specifically to those products and services or
					business relationship. 
					<br> 
					<b>12.4.2. Third
                        Parties</b>: Except as described in this Privacy Policy,
					we do not share personally identifiable information
					with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change
					to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to
					then choose to opt out. Sherwood Ventures, LLC can no
					longer update any of your personally identifiable
					information once it has been transferred to such third
					parties and cannot implement or impose your opt out
					requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must
					either contact that third party or refer to its
					privacy policy to update your personally identifiable
					information or to let the third party know that you no
					longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing
					information about its products, services or offerings.

					security within the databases that store customers'
					credit card numbers; and (3) use of encryption of
					credit card numbers.
