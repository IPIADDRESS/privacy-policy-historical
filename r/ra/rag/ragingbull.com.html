<b><p>Protecting Your Personal Privacy</p>
</b>
<p>When visiting ragingbull.com, we want you to be assured that we would never compromise your personal privacy or share your personal information with anyone with out first gaining your permission.  We have created this statement so you will know why we gather data, how we gather data and what we do with the collect data.</p>
<p> 
</p><p>Raging Bull it a free website and the majority of our revenues are derived from advertising. In order to attract and retain advertisers, we aggregate all personal demographic data and provide the results to advertisers so that they will understand the value of Raging Bull’s members as an advertising audience.</p>
<p> 
</p><p>We understand that our number one asset is our members and we will never knowingly do anything to harm the trust you have bestowed on us.</p>
<p> 
<b></b></p><p><b>Gathering of Information</b></p><b>
</b>
<p>We gather information in two ways; Voluntary Submission and "Cookies." </p>
<p> 
<i><u></u></i></p><p><i><u>Voluntary Submission</u></i></p><i><u>
</u></i><p>When you become a member of Raging Bull, or subscribe to our newsletters, we ask you a series of general demographic questions.  We then compile the information that you provide us with the information other members provide us and make the compiled result available to our advertisers and partners.  </p>
<p> 
</p><p>The information that you supply when you first access Real Time Quotes is required by the New York Stock Exchange and will be kept confidential, unless requested by an Exchange.</p>
<p> 
<i><u></u></i></p><p><i><u>Cookies </u></i></p><i><u>
</u></i><p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information, such as a member ID, which the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. </p>
<p> 
</p><p>We use cookies to track member traffic patterns throughout all of our sites.  However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual members. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a member's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string  (information contained in every member's browser). </p>
<p> 
</p><p>We also use cookies to identify you as a Raging Bull member so you don’t have to log on each time you visit our site, and to visit member-restricted areas of the sites. </p>
<p> 
<b></b></p><p><b>Uses of Information</b></p><b>
</b>
<p>We use any information voluntarily you give us to enhance your experience in our site, whether to provide you with interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on your interests. </p>
<p> 
</p><p>We aggregate this tracking information to determine which areas of our site members like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We don’t track what individual members read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. </p>
<p> 
</p><p>We also use the information that is gathered to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. </p>
<p> 
<b></b></p><p><b>Opt-out policy</b></p><b>
</b>
<p> We give our members options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: </p>
<p> 
</p><p>Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site. </p>
<p> 
</p><p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for any information from our members</p>
<p> 
<b></b></p><p><b>Correct/update policy</b></p><b>
</b>
</font><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Raging Bull offers members the ability to correct or change the information collected during registration.  Members who wish to change such information should write, </font><a href="mailto:memberupdate@ragingbull.com"><font face="Arial" size="2">memberupdate@ragingbull.com</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
