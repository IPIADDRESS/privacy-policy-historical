			<h5>Web Beacons</h5>
			<p>Certain pages on this website contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs).

	<h3>Our Stores</h3>
	<p>Here are some of the ways we collect personal information in our Stores and a description of how we use the information:</p>
	<div class="indent">
		<h4>Shopping</h4>
		<p>When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we ask you for information we need to process your purchase or provide you with the services you requested.  Depending on the payment method you use, and as permitted by applicable law, we may ask for information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, driver’s license or ID number, passport number, checking account information or payment card information.  We also collect information about your purchase, such as the items you bought, the price of the items, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale.  We use this information to process your transaction.</p>
		<h4>Customer Registry</h4>
		<p>You may join our Customer Registry at our Stores.  To join, we ask for your name, postal address, email address and mobile and home telephone numbers.  You also may choose to provide us with your birth date and gender.  We use this information to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions and for other marketing and customer service purposes. </p>
		<h4>Customer Satisfaction Surveys</h4>
		<p>When you buy products or obtain services in our Stores, we may ask you to complete a customer satisfaction survey.  If you choose to do so, you may provide information such as your name, email address, telephone number, age, gender and other demographic information, in addition to your comments.  Providing any of this information is optional.  We use the information you provide to improve our products and services, and enhance your shopping experience.</p>
		<h4>Ralph Lauren Credit Card</h4>
		<p>At some of our Stores, you may obtain and complete an application for a Ralph Lauren credit card.  Ralph Lauren credit cards are offered by a third party credit card issuer.  If you choose to complete an application at one of our Stores, at your request, we will forward your application to the issuer or you may submit the application directly to the issuer by postal mail.  Ralph Lauren does not maintain any information associated with your credit card application.  The information you provide in connection with your credit card application is managed solely pursuant to the issuer’s terms of use and privacy notice.  We strongly recommend that you review these documents if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card.  This Privacy Notice does not govern the collection or use of the information you provide in connection with your credit card application.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a name="customer"></a>
	<h3>Customer Assistance</h3>
	<p>You may call our customer service line for information about our products or personal shopping advice.  If you do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and, if you choose to make a purchase, your payment card information.  We use this information to respond to your request and process your transaction.</p>
	<a name="otherinfo"></a>
	<h3>Other Ways We Obtain and Use Information</h3>
	<p>In addition to the ways we collect information about you described above, we also may obtain information about you from third parties.  We may use your personal information to provide you with products or services you request (such as tailoring services or merchandise returns), enhance your shopping experience and communicate with you about our products, services and promotions.  In addition, we may use your personal information for internal purposes, such as fraud and theft prevention, accident reporting, development and administration of our sites and Stores, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. </p>
	<a name="dept"></a>
	<h3>Department Stores</h3>
	<p>Our products are available for sale in many department stores.  Personal information collected in these department stores is not provided to Ralph Lauren.  This Privacy Notice does not address the information practices of department stores in which our products are sold.  Department stores may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information.  We are not responsible for the department stores’ personal information practices.</p>
</div>

<a name="share"></a>
<h2>Information We Share</h2>
<p>We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here.  We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.  We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions.  These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>As described above, if you apply for a Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice.  Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
