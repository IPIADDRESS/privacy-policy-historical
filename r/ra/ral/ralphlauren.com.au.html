			<font class="submainLGText"><strong>Online Privacy Policy</strong></font><br>
			<br>
			Your privacy on the Internet is important to us at Polo.com. Our online privacy 
			policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes the types of information we 
			gather online and how we use it. Please read this information carefully. If the 
			online information practices of Polo.com change, we will let you know by 
			posting the Privacy Policy adjustments on our Web site. We will notify you by 
			E-mail of any such material changes before we use your Personal Information in 
			a manner not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. At that time we will 
			remind you that you always have the opportunity to opt-out of any new use of 
			your Personal Information (as more fully set forth below). This Privacy Policy 
			does not cover our offline privacy practices, which are described in our 
			Privacy Statement for Polo Ralph Lauren Stores.
			<p><strong>Use of Information by Polo.com</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We gather certain types of customer information in an effort to improve your 
				shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, 
				promotions and contests. Polo.com and its affiliates may also use this 
				information to make offers to you, help us develop and improve Polo.com and 
				tailor our site to your interests.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Information Collected by Polo.com </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com collects two types of information about users: “Personal 
				Information” (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone and 
				credit card numbers) and “Aggregate Information” (such as 
				information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Personal Information Collected Online by Polo.com</strong></p>
			<p>Personal Information is collected online when users voluntarily register with 
				Polo.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and 
				communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional 
				opportunities provided on Polo.com. We also maintain a record of your product 
				interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic 
				information from our affiliates and from third parties.</p>
			<p><strong>Aggregate Information Collected Online by Polo.com</strong></p>
			<p>Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about 
				you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, pages you access most 
				frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate information is used in a 
				collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled 
				information. For example, the number of people who shopped at Polo.com who are 
				25 years of age is aggregate information that does not personally identify a 
				specific user. Tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses is one method of 
				collecting aggregate information about your activities online and information 
				volunteered by you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to 
				your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers, which deliver the Web 
				pages to you, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you 
				request a page from our site, our servers log your IP address.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Sharing Information Collected Online with Third Parties, Consultants and 
					Affiliates </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com does not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal 
				Information gathered online, such as E-mail addresses, Personal Information 
				collected as a part of an online survey or other specific details about you. We 
				do not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other 
				companies access to such Personal Information. For privacy purposes, all 
				information relating to our customers is stored on a highly secure server, and 
				all credit card information is stored in an encrypted format.
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com may share Personal Information gathered online with consultants and 
				affiliates for any internal business purpose and may also divulge Personal 
				Information if such information is required for Polo.com to comply with any 
				valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court 
				order, or if Polo.com believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful 
				acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the 
				general public. In addition, Polo.com receives personal usage and demographic 
				information from its affiliates and from third parties and uses this 
				information to improve our products and services.
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com may share Aggregate Information with affiliates and consultants for any 
				internal business purpose and with third parties for their advertising and 
				promotional purposes.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Use of Cookies </strong>
			</p>
			<p>A cookie is a small data file that Web sites, when you visit them, often store 
				on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), 
				which is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. Polo.com uses 
				cookies to make your experience more enjoyable in a number of ways, such as 
				enabling our "E-mail a friend" function once you have signed in, and 
				preserving the contents of your shopping bag for up to 48 hours. Polo.com also 
				uses cookies to measure activity on our site, which allows us to determine 
				which areas and features of our site are most popular. This information allows 
				us to make improvements and updates to enhance your Polo.com experience. Parts 
				of our site, such as the members-only areas (for example, shopping, auction) 
				will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser 
				to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off 
				cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from 
				our site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow 
				you access to your account information.

			<p><strong>Notice to P3P Users </strong>
			</p>
			<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (“P3P”) is a standard 
				developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) that provides an 
				automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your 
				Personal Information by the websites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of 
				multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a web site’s 
				privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular website handles 
				the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can 
				automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled 
				websites and compare this information to the user’s own set of privacy 
				preferences. For example, Internet Explorer 6.0 requires third parties to set 
				cookies to deliver P3P “compact” cookie policies with their 
				cookies, and other browsers may use this mechanism soon. To enhance your online 
				experience further, the Polo website is now P3P enabled. For more information 
				on the W3C and P3P, please visit <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">http://www.w3.org/P3P/</a>. 
				Given certain limitations in the parameters chosen by W3C, however, the P3P 
				mechanisms may not describe Polo.com’s privacy practices as accurately as 
				this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, where discrepancies exist between this 
				Privacy Policy and the P3P “compact” policies, this Privacy Policy 
				shall control.</p>
			<p><strong>Security and SSL </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets 
				Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order 
				information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower 
				left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see 
				an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is 
				active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the 
				URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters 
				of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 
				Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through 
				secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and 
				therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you 
				cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our order form and 
				place your order by phone at 888-475-7674.
			</p>
			<p><strong>E-Mail and Electronic Newsletters</strong><br>
				<br>
				Polo.com and its affiliates may offer electronic newsletters and E-mails to 
				those who have provided their E-mail address. You will only receive a 
				newsletter or E-mail if you agree during registration or directly from our 
				newsletter sign-up form to receive these items. Unsubscribe instructions are 
				included in each electronic newsletter and E-mail. Please note that when you 
				make a purchase from Polo.com we will send you an E-mail to confirm your order 
				and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or E-mail if we have 
				other questions regarding your order.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Information Removal</strong></p>
			<p>If you prefer not to receive information from Polo.com, either by E-mail or 
				postal mail please let us know by sending us an E-mail at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@polo.com">
					unsubscribe@polo.com</a>. Please be sure to include your full name, E-mail 
				address, postal address and any message. Please note that such requests may 
				take up to six to eight weeks to become effective.</p>
			<p><strong>Children and Privacy </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet., 
				and understands that children may not understand all the provisions of our 
				Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made 
				available to adult users of the Polo.com website. We encourage parents and 
				guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the 
				sites their children visit. The Polo.com website is not directed to children 
				under the age of 13, and we will never knowingly request personally 
				identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior 
				verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a customer is under the 
				age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will 
				remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our 
				files.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Community and Public Areas</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Information posted to message boards, chat areas, club and home pages is 
				available to the general public. Please use caution when posting any such 
				information. Although Polo.com strives to protect our users’ privacy, we 
				cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information you provide in these 
				areas. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to provide 
				any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message 
				boards. Users of chat areas and message boards must also follow acceptable 
				standards of behavior when posting messages online. Polo.com reserves the right 
				to, but is not obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole 
				discretion is considered inappropriate.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Links to Other Sites </strong>
			</p>
			<p>Polo.com may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may have 
				their own privacy policy, or no privacy policy at all. We have no 
				responsibility for those sites and provide these links solely for the 
				convenience of our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content 
				providers or other companies who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a 
				co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may 
				collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with Polo.com's Privacy 
				Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any 
				third-party sites or services before providing any of them with any of your 
				Personal Information. Polo.com does not control the content that appears on 
				these sites and takes no responsibility for their content, nor should it be 
				implied that Polo.com endorses or otherwise recommends such sites or their 
				products or services offered.</p>
			<p><strong>Corrections To Personal Information Collected Online</strong></p>
			<p>You can ask us by mail for a summary of any Personal Information that Polo.com 
				has retained about you. Please address your request to Jeffrey Steinberg, Chief 
				Privacy Officer, Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, 650 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, 
				New York, NY 10022. We will send such information for review only to the email 
				address or mail address that we have on file for the visitor name that is 
				associated in our database for such information.</p>
			<p>If at any time you wish to change, correct or update your Personal Information, 
				please send your request to Jeffrey Steinberg, Chief Privacy Officer, Polo 
				Ralph Lauren Corporation, 650 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10022. 
				Please be sure to include your email address, full name and postal address.</p>
			<p>If at any time you wish to have your Personal Information removed from our 
				database, please follow the instructions in the “Information Removal” section 
				of this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p><strong>Additional Information </strong>
			</p>
			<p>No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. 
				It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Polo.com to 
				intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While 
				we strive to protect your Personal Information, Polo.com cannot ensure or 
				warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such 
				transmission is done at your own risk. If you choose to visit our site, your 
				visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our 
				Terms of use, including but not limited to limitations of damages and 
				application of the law of the State of New York. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, 
				INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, SHALL POLO.COM OR ITS AFFILIATES BE 
				LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM 
				THE USE OF THE INFORMATION OR MATERIALS ON THE POLO.COM SITE, EVEN IF POLO.COM 
				OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF POLO.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
				OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			</p>

				Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the
