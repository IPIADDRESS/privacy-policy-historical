<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Information Collection &amp; Use
</b></font>

<br><br>

Raley’s and its affiliated companies are the sole owners of the information collected on raleys.com and nobhill.com. We collect personally identifying information from our users at several different points on our web sites.

<br><br>

<i>

To use some of the features of this web site, you must first complete a registration form and create a user name and password.

</i>

<br><br>

If you purchase a product or service from us on-line, we request certain personally identifying information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). When you enter your credit card number on our order form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

<br><br>

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.

<br><br>

<i>
Prescription Refills
</i>

<br><br>

If you request a refill of your prescription on-line, we require that you provide certain personally identifying information, including your last name, birth date, and prescription number. This information is necessary to process your refill. This personally identifying information is subject to the terms and conditions of our pharmacy’s Privacy Notice, which is available on the Web-Fill web page, <a href="https://edit.raleys.com/pharmacy/onlnsvcs/privacy2.htm">or you can link directly to it here.</a>

<br><br>

<i>
Surveys
</i>

<br><br>

From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in voluntary surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifying information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Children
</b></font>

<br><br>

This web site is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. In order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we ask parents to not allow their children under the age of thirteen to provide any personal information on this web site. We ask that children under the age of thirteen not provide any personal information on this web site.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Uses of Information
</b></font>

<br><br>

We use the information we collect when you visit different sections of our site to help make our site, products and services more useful to you. For example, one section of our site may ask for a ZIP Code to help you identify store locations in the vicinity of that ZIP Code or to provide information to you about savings or special offers available in that vicinity. 

<br><br>

If you are ordering products or services, your order information will be used and disclosed by Raley’s or its affiliated companies for billing and shipping purposes and to fill your orders.

<br><br>

If you are applying for a job, your application information will be used and disclosed by Raley’s or its affiliated companies, in connection with the application and hiring process. The application information can be used to assess your suitability for employment with Raley’s or its affiliated companies, conduct background investigations or verify information about you, conduct applicant and employment-related statistical evaluation and record keeping, and comply with legal obligations or respond to legal claims.

<br><br>

Your registration information may be used to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Communications from the Site
</b></font>

<br><br>

<i>
Special Offers and Updates
</i>

<br><br>

If you have completed a registration form, we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions. 

<br><br>

<i>
Customer Service
</i>

<br><br>

Based upon the personally identifying information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your user name and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries and to provide the services you request. We will communicate with you by email or telephone.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Information Sharing and Disclosure
</b></font>

<br><br>

We share personally identifying information with certain agents and service providers as described below. 

<br><br>

<i>
Agents 
</i>

<br><br>

We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. 

<br><br>

<i>
Service Providers
</i>

<br><br>

We use other third parties to provide information on our site about promotions in your vicinity. For example, if you voluntarily provide your ZIP Code, we will share the ZIP Code as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties, however, do not receive any other personally identifying information about you when you provide your ZIP Code for that purpose.

<br><br>

<i>
Legal Disclaimer
</i>

<br><br>

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifying information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Opt-out for Quality of Life Card
</b></font>

<br><br>

On our Quality of Life Card webpage, we provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifying information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from our Quality of Life Card program, you can indicate your preference on our Quality of Life Card webpage. 

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Log Files
</b></font>

<br><br>

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

<br><br>

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to enhance the experience of our customers on our web sites. 

<br><br>

We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifying information. 

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Cookies
</b></font>

<br><br>

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. 

<br><br>

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

<br><br>

We set a persistent cookie to store your preferred store locations for weekly ads and promotions, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.

<br><br>

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as weekly ads, will be limited. 

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Links to Other Sites
</b></font>

<br><br>

This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Raley’s and its affiliated companies. Please be aware that we, Raley’s and its affiliated companies, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

<br><br>

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifying information. For example, you have left our web sites when you click on the links to UNICRU, e-cart, Upromise, Healthnotes, Diabetes Center, our community calendar links and other similar links. 

<br><br>

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us from the raleys.com and nobhill.com web sites. 

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Security
</b></font>

<br><br>

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number) on our order or job application forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

<br><br>

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<br><br>

If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can send an email to us at webmaster@raleys.com.

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Business Transitions
</b></font>

<br><br>

In the event Raley’s or its affiliates go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifying information will likely be among the assets transferred. 

<br><br>

<font face="ARIAL" size="2" class="mainsubhdr"><b>
Changes in this Privacy Statement
</b></font>

<br><br>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

<br><br>

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.

<br><br>
