</div>

<div class="main-body">

<p>In this age of information, you value your privacy more than ever before, and so does Raley’s. You deserve to know how Raley’s treats your private information gathered on these web sites. We encourage you to read these paragraphs so that you can learn more about Raley’s web site privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BY USING THESE WEB SITES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THE RALEY’S FAMILY OF FINE STORES WEB SITES.</p>
<p><b>Information Collection &amp; Use </b></p>
<p>Raley’s and its affiliated companies are the sole owners of the information collected on raleys.com, nobhill.com and foodsource.net. We collect personally identifying information from our users at several different points on our web sites.</p>
<p><i>Registration </i></p>
<p>To use some of the features of this web site, you must first complete a registration form and create a user name and password. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and address or email address). We may use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest and/or about products and special offers from our stores.</p>
<p>After you submit a completed registration form, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the registration.</p>
<p>You can browse this web site without registering, but you will need to complete a registration form in order to take advantage of certain features, such as posting comments on a blog on our web site.</p>
<p>You can modify your registration information anytime. Simply Log In, click My Account Page at the top, click Manage My Account and edit whatever information you wish.</p>
<p>Do not share your password with anyone. Other than on this web site, raleys.com will never ask you for your password.</p>
<p><i>Orders </i></p>
<p>If you purchase a product or service from us on-line, we request certain personally identifying information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). When you enter your credit card number on our order form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p>After you submit a completed order form, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the order.</p>
<p><i>Job Application Forms </i></p>
<p>If you apply for a job on our site, we require that you provide certain personally identifying information, including your name, address, phone number and Social Security number. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you. When you enter your Social Security number on our job application form, we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>After you submit a completed job application, you may receive a communication acknowledging our receipt of the application.</p>
<p><i>Prescription Refills </i></p>
<p>If you request a refill of your prescription on-line, we require that you provide certain personally identifying information, including your last name, birth date, and prescription number. This information is necessary to process your refill. This personally identifying information is subject to the terms and conditions of our pharmacy’s Privacy Notice, which is available on the Web-Fill web page, or you can link directly to it <a href="/www/feature/legal.jsp?featureid=1113647">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>Surveys, Sweepstakes and Contests </i></p>
<p>From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in voluntary surveys, sweepstakes or contests on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifying information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
<p><b>Children </b></p>
<p>This web site is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. In order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we ask parents to not allow their children under the age of thirteen to provide any personal information on this web site. We ask that children under the age of thirteen not provide any personal information on this web site.</p>
<p><b>Uses of Information </b></p>
<p>We use the information we collect when you visit different sections of our site to help make our site, products and services more useful to you. For example, one section of our site may ask for a ZIP Code to help you identify store locations in the vicinity of that ZIP Code or to provide information to you about savings or special offers available in that vicinity.</p>
<p>If you are ordering products or services, your order information will be used and disclosed by Raley’s or its affiliated companies for billing and shipping purposes and to fill your orders.</p>
<p>If you are applying for a job, your application information will be used and disclosed by Raley’s or its affiliated companies, in connection with the application and hiring process. The application information can be used to assess your suitability for employment with Raley’s or its affiliated companies, conduct background investigations or verify information about you, conduct applicant and employment-related statistical evaluation and record keeping, and comply with legal obligations or respond to legal claims.</p>
<p>Your registration information may be used to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<p><b>Communications from the Site </b></p>
<p><i>Special Offers and Updates </i></p>
<p>If you have completed a registration form, we will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions.</p>
<p><i>Customer Service </i></p>
<p>Based upon the personally identifying information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your user name and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries and to provide the services you request. We will communicate with you by email or telephone.</p>
<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure </b></p>
<p>We share personally identifying information with certain agents, representatives, contractors and service providers for limited purposes, including but not limited to, filling customer orders, offering certain products and services in connection with this web site, communicating with customers, providing customer service, enhancing and improving customers’ shopping experience, administering or facilitating surveys, sweepstakes or contests, offering targeted marketing communications to customers that opted-in to receive such communications, enabling access to our partners’ websites (e.g., LifePics, e-cart, Upromise, etc.), providing a personalized shopping experience, preventing fraud, and completing payment method processing. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifying information that can identify any individual person.</p>
<p><i>Legal Disclaimer </i></p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifying information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to prevent harm or injury, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.</p>
<p><i>Controlling Marketing Communications</i></p>
<p>Raleys.com may from time to time send you email messages or other forms of marketing communications describing new items, featured merchandise and great values. You can choose to stop receiving any marketing emails from us at any time by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in.</li>
    <li>Click My Account Page at the top</li>
    <li>Select or deselect your email subscriptions.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Please allow up to 10 days for us to process your request. If you would prefer to stop receiving other forms of marketing communications from us, please follow the directions on the marketing materials or contact our Customer Affairs department. Even when you elect not to receive marketing emails, you will continue to receive certain emails from raleys.com to: confirm any purchases you make on this web site, let you know your order has been shipped, share other information about your order, respond to your customer service inquiries, and answer any other questions you may have about this web site. In addition, we may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to this web site that might affect your personally identifying information. Finally, you will receive service and reminder emails if you register to use certain raleys.com services, such as the Pharmacy AutoFill service.</p>
<p><b>Opt-out for Quality of Life Card </b></p>
<p>On our Quality of Life Card webpage, we provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifying information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from our Quality of Life Card program, you can indicate your preference on our Quality of Life Card webpage.</p>
<p><b>Log Files </b></p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to enhance the experience of our customers on our web sites.</p>
<p>We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifying information.</p>
<p><b>Cookies and Other Computer Information</b></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. Visitors to the web site are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile.</p>
<p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.</p>
<p>In addition, a user who has clicked on a raleys.com advertisement on another web site that links to raleys.com may be sent a persistent cookie that allows us to analyze advertising effectiveness and manage our relationship with the referring web site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies are used to customize the content of certain sections of the web site and enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our web site. For example, we may set a persistent cookie to store your preferred store locations for weekly ads and promotions, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.</p>
<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as weekly ads, will be limited.</p>
<p>We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to raleys.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring web site, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the web site.</p>
<p>We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers' activities on the web site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the web site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies.</p>
<p><b>Links to Other Sites </b></p>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Raley’s and its affiliated companies. Please be aware that we, Raley’s and its affiliated companies, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>
<p>We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifying information. For example, you have left our web sites when you click on the links to UNICRU, e-cart, Upromise, Healthnotes, Diabetes Center, our community calendar links and other similar links.</p>
<p>This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us from the raleys.com and nobhill.com web sites.</p>
<p><b>Security </b></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number) on our order or job application forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, your personally identifying information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.</p>
<p>Your personally identifying information is protected by the password you created when you completed the registration form at raleys.com or by another password you created after changing a previous password. Keep your password confidential. No representative of Raley’s will ever ask you for your password.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can send an email to us at webmaster@raleys.com.</p>
<p><b>Business Transitions </b></p>
<p>In the event Raley’s or its affiliates go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifying information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
<p><b>Changes in this Privacy Statement </b></p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.</p>
<p><b>Contact Us </b></p>
<p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at webmaster@raleys.com.</p>
<p>Effective Date: This privacy policy was last updated on January 27, 2009. Please check our privacy policy periodically for changes.</p>
