<p>Our websites may provide online newsgroups, chat forums, and blogs for our users. Any information that you disclose in these forums becomes public information, which could be read, collected, or used by other users to send you unsolicited messages. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Our websites may also provide for "Live Chat" functionality, wherein Pivotal personnel can monitor the user's areas of interest in the website and engage in instant messaging with the user to provide additional information or answer any questions. By posting in our newsgroups and using "Live Chat," you explicitly consent to these uses of your information. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums. For testimonials, we provide a choice as to whether a user posts his or her personal information along with the testimonial. See also the next section for an explanation of how Pivotal uses cookies, web beacons, and other electronic tools to collect other information about you for advertising and other purposes.</p>
<div class="h3">Collection of Information Using Cookies and Other Tools for Online Advertising</div>
<p>
Pivotal may collect and/or log your Internet Protocol address, Internet domain name, the web browser and operating system used to access our websites, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit. Pivotal may collect this information automatically as you browse our websites through the use of log files and web beacons.
Pivotal may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites. Cookies are text files that are sent from a website or application via your browser and placed on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device. Thereafter, when you visit that website or application, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website or application, and this information about your activities is stored in the cookie. The information collected in cookies (e.g., the web pages you visit on the website and navigation patterns, the date and time of your visit, the number of links you click within the site, the functions you use on the site, the databases you view and the searches you request on the site, the data you save on, or download from, the site, and the third-party websites you visited immediately before and after visiting the websites, and when you open our e-mails or click on any of their links) may be used and analyzed to improve our service to you and to personalize your web-browsing experience by providing Pivotal with a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites. Cookies may be linked to your personal information, such as your e-mail address or password. We may also use cookies and other electronic tools placed by a third-party service provider to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and other information and help us understand what product information is of most interest to our customers and what kinds of advertising offers our customers like to see. Although the service provider logs the information coming from our websites on our behalf, Pivotal controls how that data may and may not be used.

<p>We may disclose information that does not identify any individual (e.g., anonymous, aggregated data) without restriction. Pivotal contracts with third-party service providers, partners and suppliers (including distributors and resellers) to deliver certain products, services, and customer solutions. Examples of such services provided on our behalf are mail delivery, website hosting, transaction processing, and event planning.

<p>Third-party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are authorized to use your personal information only for the purpose it was originally intended or as required or permitted by law. However, unless otherwise dictated by law or agreement, Pivotal is not responsible for any improper use by such parties.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information and other information, including across country borders:</p>

<li>to our subsidiaries, affiliates, and worldwide offices,</li>
<li>to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, law enforcement or government request, or other legal process,</li>
<li>to produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings,</li>
<li>if Pivotal determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure is necessary to provide its services or to protect the rights, interests, safety, or property of its business, employees, suppliers, customers, or others,</li>
<li>in connection with any proposed or actual sale or other transfer of some or all assets of Pivotal, and/or any proposed or actual sale or merger of Pivotal or any division of Pivotal,</li>
<li>to enforce the terms of any agreement with Pivotal,</li>
<li>to combat fraud or other criminal activity,</li>

To protect your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information. To request access to your personal information, follow the applicable instructions below. While we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request, we also reserve the right to reject such access requests or to impose certain restrictions and requirements on such requests, if required or permitted by applicable law.

These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus protection, network monitoring, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) or similarly encrypted browsers. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure, and you understand that Pivotal does not ensure or warrant the privacy or security of any information we collect from or about you, and that you use the Pivotal websites and other Pivotal services and provide us with information at your own risk. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Please also be careful to avoid “phishing” scams, where someone may send you an e-mail that looks like it is from Pivotal asking for your personal information. Pivotal will never request your personal information through e-mail.</p>
