<section id="content_disclaimer">
	<p>The Prepaid Visa RushCard is issued by MetaBank®, Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> When you Direct Deposit $3,000 or more in combined tax refunds from the US Department of the Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies, you will receive a $30 account credit. When you Direct Deposit between $2,000 and $2,999 in combined tax refunds from the US Department of the Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies, you will receive a $20 account credit. If you Direct Deposit $2,000 - $2,999 and then later Direct Deposit an additional amount from the US Department of Treasury or from your local or state tax agencies which brings your total combined deposited tax refund amount to more than $3,000, you will receive an additional $10 account credit. Limit one offer per customer. Account will be credited within 30 days after qualifying deposit. The card account must be in good standing at the time the credit is given, meaning your RushCard is not dormant, blocked, revoked or closed. Offer is void where prohibited. Offer expires 5/15/2016. This optional offer is not a MetaBank product or service and MetaBank does not endorse it.</p>
<p><strong>†</strong> Faster access to funds is based on comparison of a paper check versus electronic Direct Deposit.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Important information for opening a card account: To help the federal government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a card account. What this means for you: When you open a card account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.</li>
    <li>Getting your money up to two days sooner is based on comparison of traditional banking policies and deposit of paper checks from employers and government agencies versus electronic direct deposits. Many employers and government agencies notify us of direct deposits before your "official" day scheduled for payment. If we receive early notice, we may load your direct deposit earlier than your "official" day scheduled for payment. We may limit the amount or type of Direct Deposit eligible for early loading.</li>
    <li>There is no charge for Rush Text alerts; however, standard text message and data rates, fees, and charges may apply. Charges are dependent on your service plan, which may include fees from your carrier to send and receive text messages. Charges will appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your prepaid phone balance. Message frequency will be determined by the alert options you select. For more information, refer to our RushTEXT terms under My Contact Preferences in the online account or text the word "HELP" to 697874 (MYRUSH). To unsubscribe, text the word "STOP" to 697874 (MYRUSH).</li>
    <li>The combined total of Transaction Fees and International Transaction Fees is limited to $10.00 in each calendar month and is based on the date the transaction is posted to your card account as reflected on your statement.</li>
    <li>Maintenance Fee assessed if no Card Transactions or loads onto a Card have occurred for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days. Maintenance Fee is assessed each month and will be deducted from your Card balance until you next use your Card.</li>
    <li>Cash loading not available at Walmarts in VT. Check loading not available at Walmarts in NJ, NY, RI, VT.</li>
    <li>The Visa Zero Liability policy covers U.S.–issued cards only and does not apply to ATM transactions, PIN transactions not processed by Visa, or certain commercial card transactions. Cardholder must notify issuer promptly of any unauthorized use. Consult issuer for additional details or visit <a href="http://www.visa.com/security">www.visa.com/security</a>.</li>
    <li>If you add money to your RushCard prior to setting up a PIN, you will not be able to access that money until you set up a PIN.</li>
    <li>This is not a credit card.</li>
    <li>Your Prepaid Card account and associated direct deposit account number cannot be used for preauthorized direct debits from merchants or from utility or Internet service providers. If presented for payment, these preauthorized direct debits will be declined and your payment to the merchant or provider will not be processed. The bank routing number and direct deposit account number are for the purpose of initiating direct deposits to your Prepaid Card account only. You are not authorized to provide this bank routing number and direct deposit account number to anyone other than your employer or payer. Direct deposit capability is subject to payer’s support of this feature. Check with your payer to find out when the direct deposit of funds will start.
