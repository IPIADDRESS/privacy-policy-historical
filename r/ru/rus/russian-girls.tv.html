                <h2>What personal information we collect:</h2>
                <p>When you visit the Anastasia-Date.com Web site and use all Services we capture the Internet provider’s domain name and country that you came from (e.g., ‘aol.com’) and the paths taken as you move from page to page (i.e., your “click stream” activity).</p>
                
                <h2>Visitor Registration or Requests for Information:</h2>
                <p>Anastasia-Date.com only collects personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using or registering with the Anastasia-Date.com site. “Personal information” includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address; and, in the case of affiliate agreements, your name and company name. While you can browse Anastasia-Date.com without registering you will need to register in order to take advantage of certain features.</p>
                <h2>Browsing and the use of Cookies:</h2>
                <p>Anastasia-Date.com uses cookie technology as part of our statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience and gathers Web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from (e.g. ‘aol.com’, or ‘umich.edu’) and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to Anastasia-Date.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your “click stream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page). Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.</p>
                <p>We also use standard Web server log files to help us count visitors and evaluate our site’s technical capacity. We use this information to find out how many people visit Anastasia-Date.com, help us arrange the pages in the most user-friendly way, keep the site browser-friendly, and to make our pages more useful to our visitors. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used.</p>
                <p>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</p>
