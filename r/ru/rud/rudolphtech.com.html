<ul><li>about your computer including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, and operating system;</li><li>about your visits to and use of this website including the referral source, length of visit, page views, and website navigation paths;</li><li>such as your email address, that you enter when you register with Rudolph Technologies website and request to be contacted; and</li><li>such as your name and email address, that you enter in order to set up subscriptions to Rudolph Technologies’ emails and/or newsletters.</li></ul><p>Rudolph Technologies also collects certain anonymous information that cannot be associated with any individual personally, such as the number of visitors to the company’s website and the number of visitors requesting information. Rudolph Technologies may analyze this data to evaluate trends and statistics and to help the company assess customer needs in order to improve the website and better serve its customers.</p>
<p>Before you disclose to Rudolph Technologies the personal information of another person, you must obtain that person’s consent to both the disclosure and the processing of that personal information in accordance with this policy.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Rudolph Technologies’ website uses cookies, with the exception of access to the Company's proxy materials. Cookies are small text files (a string of letters and numbers) that the Rudolph Technologies website may ask to place on the computer hard drive of an individual viewing the company’s website. If the viewer’s computer browser is set to accept cookies, then the browser can add the text in a small file. The text file is then sent back to Rudolph Technologies server each time your browser requests a page from the company’s server. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that Rudolph Technologies may store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. Consenting to Rudolph Technologies use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy when you first visit our website permits the company to use cookies every time you visit the Rudolph Technologies website.</p>
<p>Rudolph Technologies uses Google Analytics cookies on the company’s website to recognize a computer when a user visits the website. Rudolph Technologies will not use cookies to read other information on your computer's hard drive. Instead, the cookies may be used to confirm the access to the company website, to help Rudolph Technologies analyze and improve the usage of its website in general and potentially to personalize the website for each user. In addition, cookies could also be used if an individual submits a request with Rudolph Technologies for literature or other information. While the majority of computer browsers are initially set to accept cookies, they can be set to either refuse the placement of cookies or to provide a warning prior to the placement of a cookie - for example:</p>
<ul><li>in Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using the cookie handling override settings available by clicking “Tools,” “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and then “Advanced”;</li><li>in Firefox (version 24) you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Options,” “Privacy,” selecting “Use custom settings for history” from the drop-down menu, and unticking “Accept cookies from sites”; and</li><li>in Chrome (version 29), you can block all cookies by accessing the “Customize and control” menu, and clicking “Settings,” “Show advanced settings,” and “Content settings,” and then selecting “Block sites from setting any data” under the “Cookies” heading.</li></ul><p>Blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on Rudolph Technologies website. Cookies already stored on your computer may be deleted from the computer but as with blocking cookies, deletion of cookies may have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites.</p>
