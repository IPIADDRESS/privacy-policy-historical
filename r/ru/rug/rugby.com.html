Polo Ralph Lauren does not maintain any information associated with your credit card application.  The information you provide in connection with your credit card application is managed solely pursuant to the issuer's terms of use and privacy policy.  We strongly recommend that you review these documents if you apply for a Polo Ralph Lauren credit card.

	<p>
	Our products are available for sale in many department stores.  Personal information collected in these department stores is not provided to Polo Ralph Lauren.  This Privacy Notice does not address the information practices of department stores in which our products are sold.  Department stores may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review when you provide them with your personal information.  We are not responsible for the department stores' personal information practices.

<a name="InformationWe">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">
Information We Share
</p>
<p>
We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our customers, except as described here.  We may share the personal information you provide to us with our affiliates worldwide, licensees and joint venture partners for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice.  We also may share the information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions.  These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
As described above, if you apply for a Polo Ralph Lauren credit card at one of our Stores, we may provide the information on your application to the credit card issuer to fulfill your request.   
</p>
<p>
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Notice.  Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

How We Protect Personal Information
</p>
<p>
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website or in our Stores against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing.  We use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology to protect the transmission over the Internet of your payment card data.  You can check the security of your connection by looking at the URL line of your browser.  When accessing a secure site, the first characters of the site address change from "http" to "https."  If you are using a web browser or firewall that does not permit communications through secure sites, you will not be able to make purchases on our site.
</p>
<p>
We strive to protect the confidentiality and security of Social Security numbers ("SSNs") in our possession, custody or control by employing reasonable safeguards seeking to (i) restrict employee access to and use of SSNs; (ii) prevent unauthorized third party access to SSNs, and (iii) prohibit unlawful disclosure of SSNs.

</p>
<p>
We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which you originally provided it.  These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information.  When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Notice.
