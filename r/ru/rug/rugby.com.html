Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we gather online and in our Stores and how we use this information. Please read this information carefully. </p>

<p>Our policies relating to the transfer of Personal Information from the European Union ("EU") to the United States are contained in our <a href="#security" class="body">Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</a>. </p>

<p><b>Use of Information Collected by Us </b></p>

<p>Polo may collect two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and the items you purchase) and "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis or frequency of customer visits to Polo Ralph Lauren Stores). </p>

<p>We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Sites and Stores to your interests. </p>

<p><b>Personal Information Collected Online by Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com and at Our Stores </b></p>

By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although Omniture logs the information coming from the Site on our behalf, Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers, and marketing strategy by utilizing Omniture's tool, you can "opt-out" of this Web site analysis tool by clicking here <a href="http://www.omniture.com/web_analytics-privacy.html#optout">http://www.omniture.com/web_analytics-privacy.html#optout</a>. </p>

<p>We also share with Epsilon Site usage information about visitors to our Site who have received a targeted promotional campaign with Epsilon for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com and Epsilon note some of the pages you visit on our Site through the use of web beacons, which are defined below. </p>

<p>Finally, both Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com, affiliate sites, and our Stores, use MBS (<a href="http://www.mbsinsight.com">www.mbsinsight.com</a>) for data processing services relating to the maintenance of our customer marketing database. MBS has agreed to maintain our customer information in confidence and to not disclose customer information to any third parties unless required to do so by law or authorized to do so by Polo Ralph Lauren for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><b>Use of Cookies </b></p>

<p>A cookie is a small data file that Web sites, when you visit them, often store on your hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as unique user ID), which is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com uses cookies to, preserve the contents of your shopping bag between your visits. Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com also uses cookies to measure activity on our Site, which allows us to determine which areas and features of our Site are most popular. This information allows us to make improvements and updates to enhance your Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com experience. Parts of the Site, such as the members-only areas (for example, shopping) will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you turn off cookies or refuse them, though, you will not be able to make a purchase from the Site, nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. </p>

<p>To enable or disable cookies on your browser, please consult your browser documentation or contact your software provider. </p>

<p><b>Use of Pixel Tags/Clear GIFs/Web Beacons </b></p>

<p>A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit. </p>

<p><b>Notice to P3P Users </b></p>

<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project ("P3P") is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") that provides an automated, machine-readable mechanism for understanding the use of your Personal Information by the Web sites you visit. P3P uses a standardized set of multiple choice questions covering the major elements of a Web site's privacy policy to provide a cross-section of how the particular Web site handles the personally identifiable information of its users. P3P-enabled browsers can automatically read this set of preferences made available by P3P-enabled Web sites and compare this information to the user's own set of privacy preferences. For example, Internet Explorer 6.0 requires third parties to set cookies to deliver P3P "compact" cookie policies with their cookies, and other browsers may use this mechanism soon. To enhance your online experience further, the Site is now P3P enabled. For more information on the W3C and P3P, please visit <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">http://www.w3.org/P3P/</a>. Given certain limitations in the parameters chosen by W3C, however, the P3P mechanisms may not describe Ralph Lauren Rugby - Rugby.com's privacy practices as accurately as this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, where discrepancies exist between this Privacy Policy and the P3P "compact" policies, this Privacy Policy shall control. </p>

<p><b>Security and SSL </b></p>

<p>Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at 866-99-RUGBY (866-997-8429).</p>
