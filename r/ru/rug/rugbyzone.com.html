last updated on Feb 4th, 2008.<br>
<br>
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how
MediaZone.com, Inc. ('MediaZone') treats Personal
Information that MediaZone collects and receives, including
Personal Information related to your use of the MediaZone service.
This policy applies to all Personal Information collected or
submitted through the MediaZone website, e-mail communications
between you and MediaZone or other means.</span></p>
<p class="white">The term 'Personal Information' means
information about an individual that is personally identifiable and
not publicly available, such as one's name, contact details,
and credit card information, as well as the products and services
in which one expresses an interest and/or which one purchases.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
In order to create an account with MediaZone and/or order and
access certain services, products and areas provided by MediaZone
(collectively, the "Services"), you are required to
provide certain Personal Information requested by the online
registration feature, ordering feature and/or other pages or
functions within the Services. This information may include your
legal name, personal address, personal phone number, personal
e-mail address, subscriber name or "screen name" and
password used to access the Services. The Company reserves the
right to request any additional information necessary to establish
and maintain your account for use of any of the materials, goods or
services available in connection with the Services. Once a username
is created for you, MediaZone stores such information in order to
enable you to use the Services and to customize your
experience.<br>
If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you
will not be able to register with MediaZone, subscribe to the
Services, make any purchases or other transactions through the
Service, or obtain other services or benefits that require such
disclosure.<br>
MediaZone is the sole owner of all Personal Information provided to
it, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In the event
MediaZone is acquired by, is merged into or is otherwise succeeded
by another company, MediaZone reserves the right to transfer its
ownership of such Personal Information to such other company
without notice to you. In the event of such a transfer, the privacy
policy of the other company, to the extent it has one, may supplant
this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
Except as set forth herein, MediaZone will not provide any of your
Personal Information to other companies or individuals without your
permission, unless required by law or for other legal purposes
consistent with this Privacy Policy. MediaZone will not rent, sell,
or share your Personal Information to any unrelated third party
except as described below. MediaZone may use your Personal
Information for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="white">1. To verify your user status, including without
limitation by confirming that you are a MediaZone subscriber, that
you have paid for particular content that requires payment or that
you satisfy other conditions concerning particular content (e.g.,
geographic or time restrictions);<br>
2. To process your transactions, including without limitation for
billing purposes and for delivery of the applicable Services to
you;<br>
3. To confirm your subscription to or cancellation from MediaZone,
or any particular purchases or licenses;<br>
4. To customize the advertising and content you see based on your
characteristics;<br>
5. To improve our services;<br>
6. To update and inform you about MediaZone services and products,
including the Services to which you have subscribed;<br>
7. To provide you with targeted advertising, promotions and special
offers from MediaZone or our affiliates, advertisers, sponsors or
other business partners;<br>
8. To conduct research and surveys and aggregate data for the
purpose of reporting trends (based on aggregated data that does not
personally identify you) to MediaZone and its business
partners.<br>
9. To provide specific user data to Nimbus International, a
provider of content for MediaZone Cricket Service ONLY.<br>
10. To provide specific user data to Premier Media Group, a
licensor of content for the FOX SPORTS Running Rugby On Demand
offer ONLY</p>
<p class="white">Names, postal and e-mail addresses collected may
be added to MediaZone's databases and used for future
communications and mailings regarding updates, new products and
services of MediaZone, upcoming events, and status of transactions
you conduct online. If you desire not to receive the above
information, you may contact us with such a request, in which case
we will remove you from the requested lists. MediaZone reserves the
right to contact you regarding your account status and changes to
the Terms and Conditions of Use, Privacy Policy and any other
policies or agreements relevant to the Services, without offering
you the opportunity to opt out of, or opt in to, receiving
them.<br>
MediaZone may provide your Personal Information to third party
subcontractors for the purpose of processing payment, delivering
goods or services to you or for other purposes related to your
purchase or use of the Services. MediaZone will provide those third
parties only the information they need to perform the contemplated
services.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Opt Out</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
As a subscriber or registrant to MediaZone, you may be sent email
correspondence providing you with an opportunity to opt out of
receiving future communications based on your preferences. Except
as permitted or required by law or in accordance with this Privacy
Policy, MediaZone will not send you offers or other communications
if you have opted out of receiving them by clicking the appropriate
box(es) during the registration or purchase processes or by opting
out of receiving correspondence.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
Like other major websites, MediaZone uses cookies to track traffic
patterns on our website and to provide users with a customized
experience when using our products and services. A cookie is a text
file that our website transfers to your computer's hard drive
for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your
visit to our website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
deliver viruses to your computer.<br>
Most Internet browsers are set up to automatically accept cookies.
You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may limit
system performance and may even cause certain features of the
website to malfunction or not to work at all. You agree that
MediaZone shall not be liable to you for any such malfunction or
limited system performance.<br>
MediaZone reserves the right to set and access MediaZone cookies on
your computer and to authorize the advertisers on the MediaZone
site to set and access their cookies on your computer. MediaZone
treats any Personal Information that may be contained in cookies
with the same confidentiality as other Personal Information you
provide to us. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject
to their own privacy policies, not this policy.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Disclosures Required by Law and Investigations</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
MediaZone reserves the right to disclose your Personal Information
in order to comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal
process, or to establish or exercise MediaZone's legal rights
or defend against legal claims.<br>
MediaZone reserves the right to use and disclose your Personal
Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action
regarding illegal activities, infringement of the intellectual
property of MediaZone or a third party, suspected fraud, situations
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or
violations of MediaZone's terms of use, or as otherwise
required by law.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Security and Confidentiality of Personal
Information</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure
the correct use of Personal Information, MediaZone has put in place
appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures which
MediaZone regards as appropriate to safeguard and secure the
Personal Information MediaZone collects online.<br>
MediaZone uses encryption technology to protect the security of the
information collected and transmitted through its website and
Services. When MediaZone's registration and order forms ask
users to enter sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card
number and/or social security number), that information is
encrypted and transmitted to a secure database server using Secured
Socket Layer encryption technology.<br>
In addition, your MediaZone Account Information is
password-protected for your protection. After a successful login,
you can change your password at your discretion. MediaZone
recommends that you choose a password that would be difficult to
guess, that you change your password periodically and that you keep
your password secret (including by not allowing friends or family
members to use your account and password). You acknowledge that you
are responsible for selecting a password and maintaining its
secrecy. Under no circumstances will MediaZone be liable to you or
any third party for your failure to maintain the secrecy of your
password.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>No Liability for Acts of Third Parties</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
Although MediaZone will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the
confidentiality of the Personal Information you submit,
transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made
absolutely secure. MediaZone will have no liability for disclosure
of information and data you submit to it due to errors in
transmission, unauthorized acts of third parties or through the use
of third party cookies, programs, routines, viruses or other
devices on your computer.<br>
Once you leave the MediaZone site, including by clicking on links
on MediaZone's website, you will be subject to the privacy
policies of third party website operators and other companies which
may differ significantly from this policy. MediaZone encourages you
to be aware of when you leave the MediaZone site and to read the
privacy policies of each website that collects information from or
about you.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Children</strong></p>
<p class="white">MediaZone does not currently accept any
information submitted to or through the Services from children
under the age of 13. No information should be submitted to
MediaZone or through the Services by children under 18 years of age
without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. MediaZone
does not allow children under 13 to open an account or to receive
direct marketing communications arising from their use of the
Services and, therefore, MediaZone does not provide any personally
identifiable information from children under 13 to any third
party.</p>
<p class="white"><br>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p class="white"><br>
MediaZone may update this policy from time to time. Any changes or
updates will be effective immediately upon posting to
MediaZone's website, and your use of the website or any of the
Services following such posting constitutes your acceptance of the
Privacy Policy as so changed or updated. We reserve the right to
notify you about changes in the way we treat Personal Information
by sending a notice to one or more of the email addresses specified
in your MediaZone account or by placing a notice on the MediaZone
site in a manner and for a period of time that we determine in our
sole discretion.</p>
<br>

this privacy policy is found to be invalid by any court having
competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
