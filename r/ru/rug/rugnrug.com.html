				Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our 
				commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services 
				with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients 
				and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in 
				understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal 
				information you provide to us and to assist you in making 
				informed decisions when using our Web Site. This statement will 
				be continuously assessed against new technologies, business 
				practices and our customers' needs. <br>
				<br>
				<b>YOUR CONSENT</b><br>
				By using the Web Site, you signify your consent to Rugnrug.com's 
				collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in 
				accordance with this Policy. <br>
				<br>
				<b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b><br>
				When you visit Rugnrug.com, you may provide us with two types of 
				information: personal information you knowingly choose to 
				disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and usage 
				information that is automatically collected on an aggregate 
				basis as you and others browse our Web Site. <br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. Information that is Automatically Collected</b> <br>
				<br>
				<i>Non-Identifiable Information</i> - Like many other Web sites, 
				Rugnrug.com automatically collects certain non-identifiable 
				information regarding Web Site users, such as the Internet 
				Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your 
				Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Web 
				Site, the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked 
				directly to the Web Site, the operating system you are using, 
				the sections of the Web Site you visit, the Web Site pages read 
				and images viewed, and the content you download from the Web 
				Site. This non-identifiable information is used for Web Site and 
				system administration purposes and to improve the Web Site. 
				Rugnrug.com may also use non-identifiable information to 
				initiate interactive, real-time discussions with users. Your 
				non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and 
				permanently archived for future use. <br>
				<br>
				<i>Cookies</i> - The Web Site uses "cookies", a technology that 
				installs a small amount of information on a Web Site user's 
				computer to permit the Web Site to recognize future visits using 
				that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the 
				Web Site. For example, the information provided through cookies 
				is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Web Site (so 
				you do not have to enter your personal information every time), 
				offer personalized Web page content and information for your 
				use, track your activity at the Web Site to respond to your 
				needs, and otherwise facilitate your Web Site experience. 
				Advertisements displayed on the Web Site may also contain 
				cookies or other technologies. You may choose to decline cookies

				partners and others. None of the tracking information in the 
				reports can be connected to the identities or other personal 
				information of individual users. Rugnrug.com may also link 
				tracking information with personal information voluntarily 
				provided by Web Site users. Once such a link is made, all of the 
				linked information is treated as personal information and will 
				be used and disclosed only in accordance with this Policy. <br>

				you choose not to provide requested personal information, you 
				will not be able to use certain features of the Web Site and you
