    <p>Date Last Revised:&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, 18 April 2011</p>
        <p>RupeePower.com is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of all the personal information of our users. This Privacy &amp; Security Policy explains how we protect personal information provided through our websites such as <a href="/">www.rupeepower.com</a> &amp; our other co-branded sites (the “Site”) and how we use that information in connection with our service offered through the Site (the “Service”). “Personal information” for purposes of this Policy means information that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address.</p>
    <br>
    <p>RupeePower.com applies high privacy and security standards to protect your personal information. We regularly re-evaluate our policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Your personal information will never be sold</h2>
    <p>We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. RupeePower.com uses and discloses your personal information only as follows:</p>
    <ul class="p40l">

        <li>To enable you to apply for certain products and services for which you have chosen to apply;</li>
        <li>For market research, project planning, troubleshooting issues, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
        <li>To third-party contractors that provide services to RupeePower.com and are bound by these same privacy restrictions;</li>
