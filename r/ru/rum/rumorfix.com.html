				<p>Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Effective Date: April 20, 2010</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to RumorFix.com (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise), which is owned or controlled by Stage 29 Productions, LLC. (“Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) or other interactive features that are accessible or downloadable through&nbsp;RumorFix.com&nbsp;and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Web Site”). This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by Company (unless specifically stated).</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our&nbsp;Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Web Site and the content you submit to the Web Site, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</strong></p>
<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:</p>
<p><strong><a name="2"></a>Information You Provide Us</strong><br>We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number and physical address (“Personal Information”); and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, information regarding your education or number of children, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site. If we combine demographic information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information in those circumstances. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site, and in those cases, please do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site’s features.</p>
<p><strong><a name="3"></a>Information from Other Sources</strong><br>We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may receive information from a marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong><a name="4"></a>Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Web Site</strong><br>We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we and our third party service providers may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other similar information. We may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a “Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet (each, a “Device”), and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how our site is used, such as what types of visitors arrive at the Web Site, and what type of content is most popular. We may associate your Device Identifier or web site usage information with the Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>Web site usage information may be collected using various methods, such as the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="5"></a>Cookies</strong><br>The Web Site uses standard technology called “cookies,” which are small data files that are transferred to your Device when you visit the Web Site if your browser is set to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Site whenever you visit the Web Site, and may make navigating and using the Web Site easier for you and allow you to personalize your experience on the Web Site.
