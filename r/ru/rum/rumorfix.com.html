We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site. If we combine demographic information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information in those circumstances. You may also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself during future visits to the Web Site, and in those cases, please do not use your real name or the name of any other actual person as your user name.
