<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
We will not share or disclose your information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

We use personally identifiable information in order to give you a more enjoyable, convenient shopping experience and to help us identify and/or provide information, products or services that may be of interest to you.  We use your personally identifiable information to support and enhance your use of the Site and its features, including without limitation:  fulfilling your order; providing customer service; tracking email invitations you send; and otherwise supporting your use of the Site.  We may also track your past purchases to provide you with a personalized profile of your shopping history.

We may permit certain trusted third parties to access your information in connection with their performance of services to maintain and operate the Site and certain features on the Site.  For example, we may use third parties to host the Site; operate various features available on the Site; send emails; analyze data; provide search results and links and assist in fulfilling your orders.
</p>
<p>
Also, we may share personally identifiable or other information with our parent, subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates.  Rue La La is a division of Retail Convergence.com, LP.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally, we provide our postal mailing list (consisting of customer names and postal mailing addresses, but not email addresses) to other companies whose products we believe may be of interest to you.  In order to determine those products that we believe may be of interest to you, the information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to disclose information in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of law, or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary in order to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud and credit risk reduction.

You will receive notice when your personally identifiable information might be provided to any third party for any reason other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you will have an opportunity to request that we not share such information.

Please note that your friends and contacts may still choose to send email invitations to you.  Any user who receives an email invitation to join the Site may choose not to receive such invitations in the future by following the instructions in the email invitations and, in addition, if you are a member, you may also choose not to receive such invitations by changing your preferences as indicated above.
