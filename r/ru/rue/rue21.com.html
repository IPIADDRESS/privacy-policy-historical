		<h1>rue21's Privacy Statement </h1>
		<p>Welcome to rue21's ("rue21") website, owned and produced by rue21. rue21 owns and operates the domain name and website rue21.com (collectively, including rue21, referred to as "rue21"). rue21 Products and Services are offered by rue21 through the www.rue21.com website ("rue21 Website" or "Website") and are made available subject to this Privacy Policy. This statement discloses the privacy practices of rue21. By using the rue21 Website, the user agrees, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
This policy may be updated from time to time so please check back periodically.</p>

<p>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b> <br>
rue21 is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. rue21 will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. rue21 collects information from our users at several different points on our Website, all of which information is voluntarily supplied by you, such as, for example, name, age, address, and email address.
</p>


<p>
<b>Registration</b> <br>
A user is given the opportunity to register on our site. During registration a user is required to give user contact information (such as name, age and email address). This preliminary information is used to determine if the user is a minor and whether parental notification is required. This information is also used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers, but this information is encouraged so rue21 may provide a more personalized experience on our site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Minor Web Users</b><br>
<b>Individuals Under 13 Years of Age</b> <br>
rue21 encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the site. No information should be submitted to or posted at rue21 by users under 13 years of age without consent of their parent or guardian.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, rue21 does not provide personally identifying information to any third party from our users under 13 years of age. When a user under 13 registers, he/she is required to provide the email address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an email alerting them to that Registration. Registered users under 13 years of age may participate in activities upon registration, unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be invalidated. No information collected from users under 13 years of age is used for marketing or promotional purpose outside rue21 and its affiliates, except as described in specific promotions.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with this Statement, rue21 may collect personal information from minors under age 13 in order to provide them with access to services and content on the rue21 Website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cookies </b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Log Files </b><br>
rue21 uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer its site, track user's movement throughout our Website, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Links</b> <br>
rue21 Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that rue21 is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. rue21 encourages our users to be aware when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by rue21 Website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Contests, Promotions or Surveys</b> <br>
From time-to-time our Website may request information from users via contests, promotions, or surveys. Participation in these contests, promotions, or surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. Information requested may include, for example, and without limitation, contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address), and demographic information (such as the user's zip code and age). Any information provided may be used in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
</p>

<p>
In the event that rue21 offers contests, promotions, or surveys which may be entered by providing email and/or other information, whether on-line or off-line (e.g. via in-store entry forms), rue21 will provide entrants with the ability to chose not to receive future email from rue21.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tell-A-Friend </b><br>
The rue21 Website provides the user with a third party referral service for users over the age of 13. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a third party about our site, rue21 asks the user for the third party's name and email address. rue21 will automatically send the third party a one-time email inviting them to visit the rue21 Website. rue21 stores the third party information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. After receipt of the email, the third party then has the option of visiting the rue21 Website, ignoring the invitation or requesting the removal of the third party's information for the rue21 database. We do not accept referrals for those who are under age 13.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security </b><br>
The rue21 Website takes several precautions to protect the privacy of our users' personal information. When users submit personal information via the Website, rue21 attempts to protect such information both online and off-line. To this end, rue21 has implemented certain security measures in an attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the user's personal information under our control. We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customers lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to use it for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
If the user has any questions about the security at our Website, the user may send an email to <a href="mailto:security@rue21.com">security@rue21.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Special Offers</b> <br>
rue21 sends all new users (with the exception of minors who do not have the parental notification described above) a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, and special offers. We may send offers to selected groups of rue21 customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give the business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please email us at security@rue.21.com. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, rue21 presents the option not to receive these types of communications. For further information, please see the Notification of Changes and Opt/Out Provisions section below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b> <br>
If a user's personal information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires to use our Website, rue21 will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal information provided to us. Such changes can usually be done through the Website or by emailing our Customer Support.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choices:</b><br>
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of some rue21.com features. You can add or update certain information on pages. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please email us at security@rue21.com. (If you do not want to receive the User Agreement and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of rue21.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes).
</p>

<p>
<b>Reservation of Right </b><br>
The reservation of right described in this paragraph deals with the change of ownership or control of, or use by, rue21 or its affiliates, and is not intended to permit a stand-alone sale of your personal information to third parties. In the event that rue21 and/or its assets are sold or transferred in whole or in part to a third party/parties or used as security, the information collected on our Website pursuant to this Statement may be sold, shared, or transferred to third parties as part of such transaction. rue21 may also provide information or provide access to information to any affiliated businesses.
</p>

<p>
rue21 may use contact information provided by the user to reply to the user and send information to the user. Except as listed herein, rue21 does not intend to reveal individually identifiable information to third parties. However, rue21 reserves the right to provide aggregated information received from users to third parties. rue21 takes commercially reasonable precautions to prevent the aggregated information provided to third parties from including significant individually identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
If rue21 is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users, rue21 may, without the consent of the user, provide such information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety, rue21 may provide a user's personal information to appropriate authorities without the consent of the user or court process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Notification of Changes and Opt/Out Provisions</b> <br>
If rue21 decides to change its privacy policy, rue21 will post those changes to its Website or may choose to notify users by other equivalent means in an attempt to keep users informed of what information rue21 collects, how rue21 uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, rue21 discloses the information. If at any point rue21 decides to use a user's personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, rue21 will attempt to notify users by way of an email or equivalent means. Users will have a choice as to whether or not rue21 may use their information in this different manner. rue21 will attempt to use said personal information in accordance with the privacy policy currently followed by rue21.
</p>

<p>
<b>Disclaimer</b><br>
Although rue21 will take all reasonable efforts to protect any information provided by its users, rue21 disclaims any and all liability and any and all damages, including, but not limited to, consequential, and punitive damages, in the event that information is inadvertently disclosed to third parties other than as described in this Statement.
</p>

<p>
This site is restricted to users from the United States and those not governed by Privacy Policies of The New European Union. Users from the European Union are advised that they should not disclose personal information to rue21.
