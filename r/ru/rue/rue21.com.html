    <h2>rue21 Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Welcome to rue21’s privacy  policy (“Privacy Policy”) which forms a part of your legal agreement with us,  together with our <u><a href="/Terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a></u> and any other terms and conditions which we notify you of when you use or  attempt to use the Site.&nbsp; PLEASE READ  THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY AS IT DESCRIBES HOW WE COLLECT AND USE  INFORMATION AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WE SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Any terms not defined in this  Privacy Policy are defined in our <u><a href="/Terms.aspx">Terms  of Use.</a></u></p>
<ol>
  <li><u>Changes to Privacy Policy</u>.&nbsp; We reserve the right, in our sole discretion,  to modify, add or delete provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time and from  time to time by updating or revising this posting and such revisions shall take  effect as of the date of posting.&nbsp; Your  use of any of the Site after the effective date of any such change, means you  accept and agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, as modified. You should  come back to this web page and review this Privacy Policy regularly so that you  remain aware of the terms and conditions that apply to you.&nbsp; If you are a registered user of the Site, we  may, in our sole discretion, notify you by email of material changes to our  Privacy Policy.</li>
  <li><u>Non-Personal Information Collected and How Collected</u>.&nbsp; We and our operational service providers (as  defined below) and others who host the Site often use technology that can  recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but  which do not personally identify you.&nbsp;  Although the term “cookie” specifically refers to a small text file that  is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, for the purposes of  this Privacy Policy, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any  technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your  visits to the Site. This type of information includes such data as the Internet  or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you  are using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on the  Site (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other technological attributes  about your visit to the Site. This information is used to analyze trends,  administer the Site, track user movements on the Site and gather aggregate  demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve the Site  and your user experience. <br>
    <br>
    Cookies also  allow the Site to recognize a users’ computer or access device each time it is  used to visit the Site and cookies can keep count of how often you return.  Cookies can also track how you use the Site, your preferences for features and  functions and, if you register for the Site, cookies can store information such  as your e-mail address and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each  time you return to visit.&nbsp; Cookies don’t  personally identify you or any particular user or individual. <br>
    <br>
    We use Google  Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“ Google").  Google Analytics uses cookies to help the Site analyze how users use the Site.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including  your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the  United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating  your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for Site operators and  providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. Google  may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by  law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.  Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  By using this Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google  in the manner and for the purposes set out above. We may also use other similar  analytic services.<br>
    <br>
  You can  disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your  Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from  automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not  affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain  features and functions of the Site, for instance you will not be able to  register for Promotions, and it may also require you to re-enter certain  information each time you visit or attempt to use the Site. You should consult  the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best  configure your browser settings for your needs.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><u>Personal Information Collected</u>.&nbsp; The term “Personal Information” refers to any  information you provide in connection with your use of the Site by which you  can be personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as  your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and  any other information which might reasonably be used to identify you. We only  obtain Personal Information from you when you submit it to us via the Site or  through our stores.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, you may provide information to us  when you register for the rueCommunity, submit an expression of interest in a  job opportunity, participate in a Promotion, purchase gift cards, request to  receive marketing materials, respond to surveys or communicate with our  customer service team.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Unless you  voluntary provide or send us Personal Information, we will always ask you to  submit or provide it before collecting your Personal Information, and unless we  tell you otherwise, such Personal Information will be used for the purpose the  information was provided and as set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Please note that you may not be able to use  some features or Content on the Site, if you choose not to provide your  Personal Information when requested.
