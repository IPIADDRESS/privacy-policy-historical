  <h2>Ruba: Usage of Your Information to Enhance the Users Experience</h2>
  
  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer with information about your visit to a particular site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are erased when you close your browser and do not last beyond one visit to our Site. Session cookies help us keep track of information such as what date or restaurant you are searching for. A persistent cookie is a small file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These cookies are used to remember items like your login information if you have selected for it to be remembered on your computer.</p>
  <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to fully use the Site. In particular, session ID cookies are required to store relevant information as a user moves from page to page. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.</p>
  
  <h3>Log Files</h3>
  <p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track general user movement (as a whole rather than as individuals), diagnose problems with our servers and gather broad demographic information. IP addresses and log files are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
  
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>Ruba takes every precaution to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, this information is protected both online and offline.</p>
  <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your personal information offline. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our user's information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p>
  
  <h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
  <p>If a Registered User's personally identifiable information (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address) changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user's personally identifiable information. Registered Users can change your personal information on the User Profile (My Profile) page of our Site. Users can also email our customer support at support@ruba.com.</p>
  
  <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
  <p>If we decide to change our policies, we will add those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places on the Site we deem appropriate so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p>
  
  <h3>Contact Information</h3>
