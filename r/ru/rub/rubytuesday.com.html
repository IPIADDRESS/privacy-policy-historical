<br>
<p>Ruby Tuesday, Inc. ("Ruby Tuesday") is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of our visitors. We want to make sure your online experience is safe and enjoyable. Any information collected from you through the website or mobile application displaying this policy (referred to in this policy as our “web sites”) is used to provide you with a broad range of services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you may be asked at times to provide information such as name, e-mail address, and opinion and concerns about certain products and services. Ruby Tuesday uses its web sites as communication tools. We collect information which identifies your mode of communication, such as which browser you use, the state in which your Internet server is located, how long you visit and where on our web site you view. This information is used to update and enhance your visit to Ruby Tuesday web sites. </p>
<p>Ownership of any information you provide will be held by Ruby Tuesday alone. We do not sell ownership of this data to any other company or organization nor transfer information to competitors. Information about your visit is used internally at Ruby Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-In Email Communications</strong><br>
There is an optional section of our web site where input forms require your name, phone number, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal information. This form provides the ability to opt-in to receiving future emails of any sort from Ruby Tuesday and its affiliates. If you opt-in to receiving email communications from us, then we may send information to you on our products or services and the products and services of our affiliates.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Collection of Information</strong><br>
We use a third party to serve ads on our behalf across the web sites and the Internet. The third party may also collect anonymous information about your visits to our web site. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or an Action Tag, which we place on various web pages within our web site that allows the third party to collect anonymous information.
