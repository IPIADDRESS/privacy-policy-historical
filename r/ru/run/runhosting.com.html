<p>THIS AGREEMENT HAS A PROVISION FOR ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</p>

<p>This Registration Agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of domain name registration and related services ("Services"). In this Agreement "you" and "your" refer to you and the registrant listed in the WHOIS contact information for the domain name. "We", "us" and "our" refer to the registrars listed at the <a href="#registrars">bottom of this document</a>, any one of which will be the registrar for your domain name and all of which share common ownership, common terms and conditions, and a shared Services infrastructure. To determine which registrar your domain name is registered with, perform a WHOIS lookup at <a href="http://www.uwhois.com" target="_blank">http://www.uwhois.com</a>. You obtain the Services through your primary service provider, with whom we have a wholesale relationship (your "Primary Service Provider"). Your relationship with your Primary Service Provider may be governed by additional terms, as you and your Primary Service Provider may agree. "We," "us" and "our" does not include your Primary Service Provider, except when specifically mentioned or unless your Primary Service Provider is one of us (i.e., if your Primary Service Provider is also one of the registrars listed at the <a href="#registrars">bottom of this document</a>)). </p>

<ol>
    <!--1-->
    <li>YOUR AGREEMENT: By using the Services, you agree to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, the UDRP (defined below) and any rules, policies, or agreements published in association with specific Services and/or which may be adopted or enforced by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), any registry, or governments.</li>
    <!--2-->
    <li>CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT: This Agreement may change over time, either through amendments by us, changes to ICANN policy or applicable law which may or may not be reflected in the text of this Agreement, or otherwise.  Before any material changes to this Agreement become binding on you (other than changes resulting from a change in ICANN policy or applicable law), we will notify you of such changes by, for example, sending email to you at your email address of record.  If, as a result of such a change, you no longer agree with the terms of this Agreement, your exclusive remedies are (a) to transfer your domain name registration services to another registrar, or (b) to cancel your domain name registration services with us. Your continued use of the Services following notification of a change in this Agreement indicates your consent to the changes. Unless otherwise specified by us, any such change binds you: (1) 30 days after we notify you of the change, or (2) immediately if such change is a result of a new or amended ICANN policy or applicable law.</li>
    <!--3-->
    <li>YOUR ACCOUNT: You must create an account to use the Services ("Account"). Your Account is typically managed and/or provided by your Primary Service Provider. You are solely responsible for maintaining, securing, updating, and keeping strictly confidential all login IDs and passwords, and for all access to and use of your Account by you or any third party.

                    <li>We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing Account access information to parties who claim to have lost Account access information.

                    <!--i-->
                    <li>We are accredited registrars with ICANN for generic Top Level Domain Names ("gTLDs") (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.). ICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the gTLDs.  We also are registrars for a variety of country code Top Level Domains ("ccTLDs") (such as .co.uk, .de, etc.). For a partial list of registry administrators and for more information on gTLDs, see <a href="http://www.icann.org/tlds/" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/tlds/</a>. Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect. Domain name registrations are only for limited terms which end on the expiration date. For domain names which are created as a new registration out of the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry. For domain name registrations which were not returned to the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry. </li>
                    <!--ii-->
                    <li>We and your Primary Service Provider are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration. You acknowledge that domain name registration is a service,  domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, domain name registration services do not create a property interest and you have no such property interest in any domain name(s) which you may register with us.</li>

                    <!--i-->
                    <li>We offer for sale domain names that are registered to third parties (also known as aftermarket domain names) in a variety of top level domain names ("TLDs") ("After Market Domain Name(s)").  All After Market Domain Name registrations are offered on a first come, first served basis. If you are the first to complete an After Market Domain Name registration application for a particular domain name, including payment of the purchase price we designate, we will initiate a transfer of the relevant After Market Domain Name to your Account. At the time of transfer of the After Market Domain Name into your Account, we will add one year to the existing registration period. Any subsequent renewals of the After Market Domain Name will be charged at the then-current renewal fee.  Once you submit your order for an After Market Domain Name, you have entered into a valid, binding and enforceable contract to pay the designated purchase price for the After Market Domain Name. Because we are selling After Market Domain Names initially registered to third parties, we have no control and make no representations regarding the accuracy or legality of domain names advertised, the accuracy or legality of any domain name listing, or the right and the ability of the third party seller to transfer the After Market Domain Name or complete the transaction. We do not control whether or not third party sellers will complete a transaction.  We reserve the right to reject or cancel your After Market Domain Name registration for any reason including, but not limited to, any pricing errors. In the event your After Market Domain Name registration is rejected or cancelled by us, for any reason, we will refund in full the amount of the purchase price for the After Market Domain Name as your sole remedy.</li>
                    <!--ii-->
                    <li>Once the After Market Domain Name is transferred into your Account, such After Market Domain Name may not be transferred away from us to another registrar during the first 60 days following the transfer, during which time the After Market Domain Name may be placed on transfer lock.  All of your obligations under this Agreement which apply to the registration or renewal of domain name(s) created by you apply to any After Market Domain Name(s) acquired by you, including but not limited to prohibition against any Illegal Uses.</li>

                    <li>We might be ordered by a court or arbitrator to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name; it is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your Account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities. It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you. Our policy is to comply with court orders from courts of competent jurisdiction as well as UDRP Panel decisions.  If you contact us informing us that you are contesting a court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, we may, but are not obligated to, place a transfer lock on the domain name pending the outcome of the dispute.  If you contact us informing us that you are contesting an adverse UDRP Panel decision, your time limits and procedures to do so are subject to the requirements set forth in the UDRP.  We will not delay implementation of a UDRP Panel decision based solely on your informing us that you intend to contest the decision.</li>

                <li>From time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) registration services ("Promotional Name(s)"). If we do so, the services for the Promotional Name(s) will be placed in the same Account as your other domain name(s) and you will be listed as the registrant, though we may point the Promotional Name to IP address(es) of our choosing. If you want to assume control over the services provided to the Promotional Name, including the right to transfer or push the Promotional Name service to other registrars or other Accounts or the ability to control the DNS settings for the Promotional Name, you must pay the promotional registration fee or renewal fee, if any, and the terms of this Agreement will apply to such Promotional Name(s). If you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may request that you be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we may be listed as the domain name registrant or we may delete such domain names or make them available to others. For any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid.</li>

    <li>FEES: You agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Services, the applicable Service fees set forth on the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a> or otherwise communicated to you.

Please check the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a> often for any changes to our Services fees.  All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund. At our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.</li>
    <!--7-->
    <li>PAYMENT ISSUES: In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Services, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may suspend access to any and all Accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider and all interests in and use of any domain name registration services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider may be assumed by us or your Primary Service Provider, as the case may be, or may be terminated. We may reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fees and our then-current reinstatement fee set forth on the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a> or otherwise communicated to you.

    <!--8-->
    <li>EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICES: It is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire and to maintain current and accurate credit card information should any Services be placed on"auto-renew." As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may notify you via an email message or via your Account when renewal fees are due. Should these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled. Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time. If you select automatic renewal of the Services, we may attempt to renew the Services a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date. It is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and we are not required to, but may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.  Please note: for certain TLDs, the automatic renewal option is not available. </li>  
    <!--9-->
    <li>EXPIRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION: Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry's database, we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.

For a period of approximately 30 days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed. We may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the "reactivation period." You assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services. We may, in our sole discretion, choose not to offer a reactivation period and we shall not be liable therefore. The reactivation period renewal process, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine. We may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.</li>
            <!--b-->
            <li>After the reactivation period, we may:
            
                <ol type="i">
                    <!--i-->
                    <li>Discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter without notice.  In which case, certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed. We may, but are not obligated to, participate in this process, typically called the "Redemption Grace Period" ("RGP"). We may, in our sole discretion, choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your domain name registration services and we shall not be liable therefore. If available, RGP typically ends between 30 and 42 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services. The current RGP fee is set forth on the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a> and does not include any registration fees that may also be due. We are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued; or  </li>
                    <!--ii-->
                    <li>Pay the registry's registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued.  In which case, we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, we may set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name. We do not have to pay you any of the proceeds we may earn as a result. We are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued. The domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay the fee set forth on the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a> plus any registration fees. After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all interests and use of the domain name services; or </li>
                    <!--iii-->
                    <li>If we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.  In which case, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings. You may recover the domain name registration services for a period of up to 42 days after the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you. We are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned. We do not have to pay you any of the proceeds we may earn as a result of such an auction. To exercise your rights to recover auctioned domain name services, you must contact us and provide us with a certified letter addressed to "Expiration Recovery" and include documents setting forth your identity and address, which identity and address must be the same as the registrant as it was listed in the WHOIS information for the domain name services immediately prior to expiration, a copy of a commonly accepted (in the United States) picture ID (such as a drivers license or passport) which supports your identity and address claim, a front and back photocopy of the credit card you used to pay for Services and you must provide a statement authorizing payment of the reinstatement fee to such credit card, which amount is set forth on the <a href="/pricing.asp?PHPSESSID=89227bb1d4559aabd2831b5dfb781c8c">Pricing Page</a>, plus any registration fees. In doing so, you must provide us with sufficient time, in our sole discretion, to allow us to receive and evaluate your documents and to contact the auction winner prior to the end of 30 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.</li>

            <!--a-->
            <li>Transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/transfers/" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/transfers/</a>, including the Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy, available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm</a> as well as the UDRP as described in Section 16 of this Agreement, as these policies may be modified from time to time. To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your Account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org). Alternatively, you should contact your Primary Service Provider to have your domain name(s) services locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode." If your Primary Service Provider is unresponsive, you may contact us to have your domain name(s) locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" though we may first contact your Primary Service Provider to request that the Primary Service Provider address the request. Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request. Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due. We will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN's transfer policies. Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed. A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire, in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request following a redemption of the domain name, if any. You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.</li>
            <!--b-->
            <li>We may place a "Registrar Lock" on your domain name services and this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so. By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed.</li>

    <li>OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION AND DATA: We own all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain name database, and all information and derivative works generated from the domain name database. We own the following information for those registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration, (b) the expiration date of the registration, (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of the registrant and all contacts for the domain name registration, (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain name that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database, and (e) any other information we generate or obtain in connection with the provision of Services, other than the domain name being registered, the IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name, and the corresponding names of those nameservers. We do not have any ownership interest in your specific personal registration information outside of our rights in our domain name database.</li>
    <!--12-->
    <li>AGENTS AND LICENSES: If you are registering a domain name for or on behalf of someone else, you represent that you have the authority to bind that person as a principal to all terms and conditions provided herein. If you license the use of a domain name you register to us or a to third party, you remain the domain name holder of record, and remain responsible for all obligations at law and under this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing (and updating, as necessary) both your own full contact information, and accurate technical, administrative, billing and zone contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name and domain name registration and for ensuring non-infringement of any third party intellectual property rights.</li>
    <!--13-->
    <li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (a) SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICES, (b) USE OF THE SERVICES, (c) INTERRUPTION OF SERVICES OR INTERRUPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS, (d) ACCESS DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEB SITE(S) OR SERVICES OR DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS YOU EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO A DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED WITH US; (e) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM ACTS OF OR EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL (f) DATA NON-DELIVERY, MIS-DELIVERY, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION OR OTHER MODIFICATION; (g) THE PROCESSING OF AN APPLICATION FOR A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION; (h) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD; OR (i) APPLICATION OF ANY DISPUTE POLICY. NEITHER WE NOR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SERVICES, BUT IN NO EVENT GREATER THAN $400.00 (US Dollars). BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR AND YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</li>
    <!--14-->
    <li>INDEMNITY: You hereby release, indemnify, and hold us, ICANN, the registry operators, and your Primary Service Provider, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates of such parties harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys� fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under this Agreement, including any breach of any of your representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Services provided hereunder, or your use of the Services, including, without limitation, infringement by you, or by anyone else using the Services, of any intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of our or ICANN�s operating rules or policies relating to the Services provided. We may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to indemnify and hold us harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph. Such written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment. Your failure to provide such assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of this Agreement by you and may, in our sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name Services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which we are the registrar of record. This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification (a) required under the UDRP or any other ICANN policy or any policy of any relevant registry; or (b) set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.   </li>
    <!--15-->
    <li>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT NEITHER THE REGISTRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME NOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED NOR THE USE OF OTHER OF THE SERVICES INFRINGES THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY OR WILL OTHERWISE SUBJECT US TO A LEGAL CLAIM. THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR USE BY PERSONS WHO ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PROCUREMENT OF THE SERVICES IS ACCURATE.

WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER THAT REGISTRATION OR USE OF A DOMAIN NAME UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL IMMUNIZE YOU EITHER FROM CHALLENGES TO YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, OR FROM SUSPENSION, CANCELLATION OR TRANSFER OF THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED TO YOU. ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR E-MAIL FORWARDING OR OTHER EMAIL SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL AND/OR DATA. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICES OR ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>
    <!--16-->
    <li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: You are bound by all ICANN consensus policies and all policies of any relevant registry, including but not limited to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP"), which is available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm</a> along with the UDRP Rules and all Supplemental Rules of any UDRP provider. The UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN's successor) at any time. If the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the UDRP in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party. In the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP.  If you or your domain name are the subject of litigation, we may deposit control of your domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by providing a party with a registrar certificate. </li>

    <li>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION FOR DISPUTES: 
    
        <ol type="a">
            <!--a-->
            <li>Except as otherwise set forth in the UDRP or any similar ccTLD policy, with respect to any dispute over a domain name registration, this Agreement, your rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Washington, as if the Agreement was a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Washington. </li>
            <!--b-->
            <li>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of the agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in King County, Washington, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  Service of process on you by us in relation to any dispute arising under this Agreement may be served upon you by first class mail to the address listed by you in your Account and/or domain name WHOIS information or by electronically transmitting a true copy of the papers to the email address listed by you in your Account and/or domain name WHOIS information. </li>
            <!--c-->
            <li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the adjudication of third party disputes (i.e., disputes between you and another party, not us) concerning or arising from use of domain names registered hereunder, you shall submit without objection, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to the subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the courts (i) of the domicile of the registrant as it appears in the public WHOIS record for the domain name(s) in controversy, and (ii) where we are located, currently those State or federal courts whose geographic districts include Bellevue, Washington.</li>

    <li>GENERAL: This Agreement and all applicable ICANN policies and the policies of any relevant registry, including but not limited to the UDRP, together with all modifications, constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. The failure of us to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by us of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole. We will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original objectives and intent as reflected in the original provision. This Agreement may not be amended or modified by you except by means of a written document signed by both you and an authorized representative of us. </li>

<br>
Should you seek to register a .DE second level domain name you, the registrant, must also agree with the requirements of the .DE registration terms and conditions in German (an English translation is available for the convenience of English speakers, but the terms as they are found in the original German agreement are the actual authoritative and legally binding documentation).<br>
<br>
You should be aware that the terms to register a second level domain in the .DE namespace are not strictly and finally documented. For example, fees for a second level domain registration in the .DE namespace are charged on a  monthly basis. Registrars, however, may provide fee payment services which would allow you to pre-pay for longer  time periods. If you pre-pay for a longer period of time, you will not be given a refund by this registrar if you decide to cancel your registration prior to the end of your pre-paid period. Also, a second level domain registration in the .DE namespace is for life, though you may cancel your registration by providing one month's notice to DENIC. If you do not cancel your registration with and you stop paying the required registration fees to this registrar, then this registrar will stop making payments to DENIC on your behalf; in this case DENIC may attempt to bill you directly (and not through this registrar). After a certain period of non-payment, DENIC may then terminate your domain name registration, though it is not clear to this author whether you would also be released from the obligation to pay the registration fees incurred prior to termination by DENIC. If you stop paying the required registration fees, this registrar may, but is not required to, terminate your .DE domain name registration on your behalf. It is not clear to this author whether these terms are spelled out for prospective .DE registrants, so you are encouraged to perform your own due diligence to your own satisfaction before making the decision to register a second level domain registration in the .DE namespace.<br>

  <b><u>Transfers without EPP Key</u></b><br>
  <br>
  <b>.eu</b><br>
The gaining and losing registrants will receive an email from the registry which must be approved within 14 days.<br>
<br>
<b>.co.uk, .org.uk</b><br>
If you initiate the transfer with eNom first, you must submit the request to the losing registrar within one week. If initiating the request to the losing registrar first, you must initiate your transfer with eNom by either the 8th of current month or the 8th of the following month, whichever is closest to the current date. Request Retag from the losing registrar.<br>
<br>
<b>.de</b><br>
The gaining registrar puts in a request at DENIC. But generally .de tlds cannot be transferred.<br>
<br>
<b>.ca</b><br>
Request transfer from gaining registrar. Administrative contact needs to approve the transfer request.<br>
<br>
<b>.tv</b><br>
Request transfer from gaining registrar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Transfer  details</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>45 days rule</b><br>
  The 45-days <b>transfer</b> rule says: Due to  a registry restriction(not eNom or any other registrar, but the global  registry), if a domain is renewed and then transferred to another registrar  within the first 45 days since the renewal, the domain will <b>not have an additional year added</b> to the expiration date.<br>
  <br>
<b>.org 60 days  restriction</b><br>
  Due to  a registry restriction (Public Interest Registry; http://www.pir.org), .org  domains have a 60-day <b>transfer</b> restriction. If a .org domain has been transferred between registrars, the  Public Interest Registry does not allow a <b>transfer</b> of the domain for 60-days since the date the <b>transfer</b> was complete.<br>
  <br>
<b>.co.uk/.org.uk 3 months rule</b><br>
For <b>.co.uk/.org.uk</b> successful transfers where the domain name has <b>more than 3 months</b> remaining to expiration, domain is not renewed for two years but just trsnaferred. If the domain is within <b>3 months or less</b> of its renewal date, the domain will be renewed for 2 years.<br>

<br>  
<b>.eu</b> <br>
  The domain expiration date <b>is  extended with one year from the date the transfer or trade took place</b>, not with one year from the  existing expiration date.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Renewal  details</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>.co.uk/.org.uk</b><br>
Due to Registry restrictions, co.uk, .org.uk and .me.uk domains can only be renewed 6 months prior to expiration date.<br>
<br>
<b>Auto-renew=ON</b><br>
Certain domain names, like <b>.EU</b> and .<b>DE</b>, can only be renewed via the auto-renew  process.&nbsp; Therefore, the auto-renew should be set to 'ON' if you would  like these domains to be renewed at all.<br>
In order to renew .EU domains, they must be set to  Auto-Renew = ON.The automatic renewal will process 30 days prior to expiration date provided that there are funds available on the account. The domain will be  renewed for a one year.Due to registry restrictions, manual renewal of .EU  domains are not possible.<br>
 <br>
Domains will start being billed 30 days in advance. If a domain name's auto renewal option is set to "off", and you set the auto renewal to "on" within 30 days after the  expiration date, the system will try to bill you within 24 hours. We need to stress that this is not a good practice as some tlds such as .EU have no grace period and if you go beyond the expiration date then there is a chance you will not be able to get the domain back.<br>
<br>
<b>up to 10 years maximum renewal <!-- Renew max  for (10 - &lt;years until expiration&gt;)--></b><br>
Domain names can be registered for a maximum of 10 years. If your domain has not yet expired, you will be able to renew it for 9 years at the most.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Registration  details</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>.ca  approval email</b><br>
When .<b>CA</b> domains are  initially registered, CIRA sends an approval email to the registrant email  contact.&nbsp; The domain registration is not complete until the registrant  approves it via this email.  <b>While in this  "pending-approval" status, the domain will not resolve or otherwise  function.</b>&nbsp; The domain will appear within your account, but  you will not be able to fully manage it, especially at the registry level,  until approved. 
The registrant&nbsp;has 7 days to approve the registration, otherwise the  registration is terminated.&nbsp; If the registrant needs this approval email  re-sent,&nbsp;please open&nbsp;a support ticket.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Whois  details</u></b><br><br>
<b>.ca</b><br>
The registry will no longer display name, address, phone, fax  or email address for Individual registrants.&nbsp; It will remain as is for  Non-Individual.<br>
<br><b>Change domain's whois details from the DCP(Domain Control Panel)</b>

    At RUNHOSTING.COM we take great value

    can read our Refund Policy.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
    	<li type="1"><b>Web Hosting Accounts</b><br>
    		<br>
    		All newly registered accounts 
		    as well as upgrades from free to paid accounts are
		    subject to 30 days money back guarantee. This is applicable only for annual 
		    web hosting accounts(1,2,3,4,5 years). In case
		    you become dissatisfied with our services at any
		    point within the first 30 days, you will receive
		    a 100% refund for the hosting account.<br>
    		<br>
		    In case of web hosting renewals (after one or more
		    billing cycles), the account is not subject to 30 
		    days money back guarantee, hence the rule for the 
		    first 30 days does not apply.<br><br>
    		</li>
    	<li type="1"><b>Domain Names</b><br>
    		<br>
    		<b>Domain name sales are final and

		    the sole owner of the domain(s) purchased through
		    our service. In case you decide to leave our hosting
		    service at the end of your billing cycle or 
		    take advantage of the 30 days money back guarantee,
		    domain names are transferable to another provider.<br>
		    <br>
		    Changes to registered domain names i.e. incorrect spelling, 
		    cannot be made once the domain has been purchased. Please 
		    explicitly verify the spelling of your domain name before
		    purchase.<br><br>
    	</li>
    <li type="1"><b>Free Domain Names</b><br>
		    <br>
		    In case you get a free domain
		    name within a web hosting package purchased, 
		    and you  decide to take advantage of the 30 days
		    money back guarantee, you absolutely agree and
		    understand that domain name registrations are
		    non-refundable. Therefore upon requesting a refund 
		    based on 30 days money back guarantee, you agree 
		    to deposit the amount of $19.95 for the domain 
		    name registration before a refund for the hosting 
		    account is issued.

        IMPORTANT TERMS REGARDING RELATIONSHIP OF TERM OF DOMAIN PRIVACY PROTECTION SERVICES AND REGISTRATION TERM OF AN ASSOCIATED PRIVACY PROTECTED DOMAIN: You understand that your DOMAIN PRIVACY PROTECTION Services term begins on the date Your attempt to procure the Domain Privacy Protection Services is accepted by the Service Provider(s) and that it shall run for the unit of time which You order (typically, this would be one year). You understand that the Domain Privacy Protection Services term may be different than the registration term of the Privacy Protected Domain which is associated with the Domain Privacy Protection Services. If an Privacy Protected Domain expires and is deleted before the end of the term of the associated Domain Privacy Protection Services, then the Domain Privacy Protection Services associated with the domain will end when the Privacy Protected Domain is deleted and You understand that there will be no refund for any resulting unused portion of an Domain Privacy Protection Services term. If the Domain Privacy Protection Services term ends while the registration term for an Privacy Proteced Domain is still ongoing, then the Domain Privacy Protection Services will no longer be provided, the personal information specified in section 2 shall be listed in the WHOIS output for the (then former) Privacy Protected Domain, and the communications forwarding services specified in section 6 will no longer be provided. <br><br>  
    </li>
    
    <li type="1"><b>Your Representations &amp; Warranties</b><br>
        <br>

You also warrant that neither the Domain Privacy Protection Services nor Privacy Protected Domain(s) will not be used in connection with any illegal or morally objectionable activity (as defined below in section 5), or, in connection with the transmission of unsolicited commercial email ("Spam").<br><br>
    </li>
    
    <li type="1"><b>SERVICE PROVIDER'S SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
    <br>
    In the event of any of the following:<br>
    <br>
	<ol type="a">
		<li>If the Privacy Protected Domain(s) is (are) alleged to violate or infringe a third party's trademark, trade name, copyright interests or other legal rights of third parties;

		</li>
		<li>If Backend Service provider is named as a defendant in, or investigated in anticipation of, any legal or administrative proceeding arising out of Your use of the Domain Privacy Protection Services or an Privacy Protected Domain;
		</li>
		<li>If necessary to comply with ICANN's Dispute Resolution Policy or other policies promulgated by ICANN (including policies which may preclude use a service such as Domain Privacy protection);
		</li>
		<li>If necessary to avoid any financial loss or legal liability (civil or criminal) on the part of Backend Service Provider, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, officers, directors and employees;
		</li>
		<li>OR if it comes to Backend Service Provider's attention that You are alleged to be using the Domain Privacy Protection Services for purposes of engaging in, participating in, sponsoring or hiding Your involvement in illegal or morally objectionable activities, including but not limited to, activities which are designed, intended to or otherwise:  (i) appeal primarily to prurient interests; (ii) defame, embarrass, harm, abuse, threaten, or harass; (iii) violate state or federal laws of the United States and/or foreign territories; (iv) involve hate crimes, terrorism or child pornography; (v) are tortious, vulgar, obscene, invasive of a third party's privacy, race, ethnicity, or are otherwise objectionable; (vi) impersonate the identity of a third party; (vii) harm minors in any way; or (viii) relate to or transmit viruses, Trojan Horses, access codes, backdoors, worms, timebombs or any other code, routine, mechanism, device or item that corrupts, damages, impairs, interferes with, intercepts or misappropriates any software, hardware, firmware, network, system, data or personally identifiable information, THEN
	    </li>
	  </ol><br>
		You understand and agree that Backend Service Provider has the absolute right and power, in its sole discretion and without any liability to You whatsoever, to suspend the Domain Privacy Protection Services, terminate provisionment of the Domain Privacy Protection Services, list the information You provided in section 2 in the Whois output or provide the information You provided in section 2 to a claimant, resolve any and all third party claims, whether threatened or made, arising out of Your use of Privacy Protected Domain, or take any other action which Backend Service Provider deems necessary.<br>
		<br>
        In the event Backend Service Provider takes any of the actions set forth above or in the event You elect to cancel the Domain Privacy Protection Services for any reason, neither Service Provider will refund any fees paid by You for the Domain Privacy Protection Services.<br>
        <br>
        You also acknowledge and agree that Backend Service Provider may, in its sole discretion and without any liability to You whatsoever, cancel the Domain Privacy Protection Services during the first thirty (30) days after You procured the Domain Privacy Protection Services, and/or suspend Your rights under this Agreement and list the Domain Privacy Protection Addresses during resolution of a dispute or investigation of allegations.<br><br>
	</li>
	
    <li type="1"><b>FORWARDING COMMUNICATIONS</b><br>
        <br>
        You agree that Backend Service Provider will review communications sent to the Domain Privacy Protection Addresses associated with Your Privacy Protected Domain. For communications received via certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail which does not appear to be unsolicited commercial mail, Backend Service Provider may either i) forward such communication to You or ii) may attempt to communicate to you a scanned copy of a page of the communication to ascertain Your desires with respect to forwarding the communication to You. You specifically acknowledge that Backend Service Provider may elect to not forward to You (nor to otherwise communicate with You) regarding first class postal mail or email, fax, postal mail or telephone communications which appear to be unsolicited communications which offer or advertize the sale of goods or services or which solicit charitable contributions, or communications which appear to arise from Your having used the Domain Privacy Protection Services as a general mail forwarding service (see section 1, above). You authorize Backend Service Provider to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by Backend Service Provider, including failures which arise from Backend Service Provider's mistake in judging whether a communication appears to be an unsolicited communication.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Email</b>. The Whois directory generally requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase Domain Privacy Protection Services, Backend Service Provider creates an email address for that domain, "yourdomainname@whoisprivacyprotect.com". Thereafter, when messages are sent to the email address listed in the Domain Privacy protected Address, Backend Service Provider forwards such messages to the email address You listed in section 2. If such email address becomes non-functioning or if email to such address bounces, Backend Service Provider is not obligated to attempt to contact You through other means. You agree that Backend Service Provider may elect, in Backend Service Provider's sole discretion, to allow You to access Your Account and view email sent to the Domain Privacy Protection Addresses, though such alternative means of servicing Your Account is an option and not a requirement.<br>
        <br>
        Your Obligation to Respond to communications from the Backend Service Provider: When Backend Service Provider receives a communication which may warrant forwarding to You, per the terms of this Agreement, Backend Service Provider will send an email to the email address You provided to Backend Service Provider pursuant to section 2. The email message will identify the sender of the correspondence and the date received. As an alternative, You agree that Backend Service Provider may allow you to access Your Account to view full or partial scanned copies of (non-email) communications sent to the Domain Privacy Protection Addresses and that You may be required to interact with Your Account to have the physical originals of such communications forwarded to You and that if You do not interact with Your Account in the ways indicated upon accessing Your Account, that the communications may not be forwarded to You. In either event, You will have seventy-two (72) hours to decide whether to have the communication(s) forwarded. If you do not respond within this time period, the communication(s) will not be forwarded. Method of forward will be determined by Backend Service Provider. Communication(s) may not be immediately forwarded upon Your election; there may be a delay and communication(s) may be aggregated to be forwarded together. The Backend Service Provider may begin charging fees for forwarding communications or may change the method by which communications are forwarded without written notice.<br>
        <br>
        In the event You do not respond to communications from the Backend Service Provider regarding communications received at the IDP Address, Backend Service Provider may immediately reveal the information You provided pursuant to section 2 and/or cancel the Domain Privacy Protection Services regarding either the Privacy Protected Domain in question or with respect to all of Your Privacy Protected Domains, depending on the circumstances. This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number. This action would be taken because Backend Service Provider will not become involved in any legal or other matters between You and third parties.
