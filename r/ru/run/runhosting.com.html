           client tries to refute after he accepted them at the time of the order.<br>

					 
					 <!-- However, in case the customer presents a valid motive for the refund required, observing all above mentioned requirements, then RunHosting might process the money back procedures without hesitation. Any refund actions will immediately lead to web hosting account suspension and the customer\'s credit card will be credited with the respective sum. -->
