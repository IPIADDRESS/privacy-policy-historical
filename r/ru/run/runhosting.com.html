Domain name registrations are only for limited terms, terms which end on the expiration date.  For domain names which are created as a new registration out of the available namespace, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry; for domain names registrations which were not returned to the available namespace, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry.  You agree that we and your Primary Service Provider are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration (our limitation of liability is explained further, below).  You further agree that domain name registration is a service, that domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, and that domain name registration services do not create a property interest.<br><br>

			YOU WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES IS NOT GOING TO SUBJECT US TO ANY CLAIM(S).   You further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, your Primary Service Provider, and applicable registry administrator(s) (including Verisign Inc., Neulevel, Inc., Public Interest Registry, Afilias Limited, and other registry operators listed at <a href="http://www.icann.org/registries/listing.html" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/registries/listing.html</a>) and all such parties' directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages and reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of, or related to, the domain name registration services you are obtaining from us.<br><br>

			NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICES:  Without limitation, the following are not included in the Services: We cannot and do not check to see whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you make of the domain name(s), or other of the Service(s), infringes legal rights of others. It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use infringes legal rights of others. We might be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name; it is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities.  It is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you.  We will comply with court orders unless you contact us to contest the order.<br><br>

			IF LAWSUIT(S) ARE THREATENED: If we are sued or threatened with lawsuit in connection with Service(s) provided to you, we may turn to you to indemnify us and to hold us harmless from the claims and expenses (including attorney's fees and court costs).  Under such circumstances, you agree that you will, upon demand, obtain a performance bond with a reputable bonding company or, if you are unable to obtain a performance bond, that you will deposit money with us to pay for our reasonably anticipated expenses in relation to the matter for the coming year.  Such deposit will be drawn down as expenses are incurred, with all account notices sent to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain names and/or account.  We shall not be obliged to extend you any credit in relation to such expenses and we may terminate the Services for a failure to make or renew such a deposit.  We will return any unused deposit upon the later of one year from deposit or the conclusion of the matter.<br><br>

			DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: You agree to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ("UDRP"), which is available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm">http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm</a> .  You agree that the UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN's successor) at any time. You agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party. You also agree that, in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP.  You also understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and domain names because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding Services provided to you, you may lose your rights to receive the Services if you do not respond expeditiously to an email sent in conjunction therewith.<br><br>

			FEES: As consideration for the Service(s), renewal of the Service(s), and, if you select it, automatic renewal of the Service(s), you agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Service(s), the applicable Service(s) fees.  All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund. At our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.<br><br>

			CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CHARGES: If you have an issue with credit card charges, you should contact your Primary Service Provider (if any), first, and us, secondarily, regarding the issue before you contact your credit card company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges.  In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Service(s), you agree that we and/or your Primary Service Provider may suspend access to any and all accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider and that all rights to and interest in and use of any domain name registration(s) services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider shall be assumed by us or your Primary Service Provider, as the case may be. We will reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fee(s) and our then-current reinstatement fee, currently set at $200(US Dollars). Reinstatement of Service(s) by your Primary Service Provider may be according to the terms, if any, between you and your Primary Service Provider relating to reinstatement.  Charges for the Service(s) which use our credit card payment processor will be identified on your credit card statement as "Domain Name Registration."  We are not responsible for how charges appear on your credit card statement when the transaction is processed by your Primary Service Provider's or another third party's credit card payment processor.<br><br>

			<p>EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE(S): You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire.  As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may notify you via an email message or via your account when renewal fees are due. Should these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled. Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time. If you select automatic renewal of the Service(s), we may attempt to renew the Service(s) a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and that we are not required to, but that we may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully. *please note: for certain TLDs, the automatic renewal option is not available</p>

			ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION: As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s).  You agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate.  With respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number. You agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed.  Not providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s).  You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name. If you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase "Name Only" Services, you agree that we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from "Name Only" Services. <br><br>

			YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION: In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third party's express consent to the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement. By registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose. You acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you. You further agree that your failure to respond for over ten (10) calendar days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of account and WHOIS contact information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Service(s) to you. As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may loose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.<br><br>

			ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT AND AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY: In order to change any of your account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your account with your Primary Service Provider (if any), or your account with us. Please safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use. You agree that any person in possession of you account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information. We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information. You agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT.  If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.<br><br>

			TRANSFERS: You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at <a href="http://www.icann.org/transfers/" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/transfers/</a>, as this policy may be modified from time to time.  You agree that we may place a "Registrar Lock" on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so.  By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed. To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org).  Alternatively, you should contact your Primary Service Provider to have your domain name(s) services locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode."  If your Primary Service Provider is unresponsive, you may contact us to have your domain name(s) locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP "AuthCode" though we may first contact your Primary Service Provider to request that the Primary Service Provider address the request.  Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request.  Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due.  We will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN's transfer policies. Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed. A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request. You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.<br><br>

			PRIVACY POLICY: You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name. You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information. Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.  Information regarding ICANN's guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm</a>, <a href="http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm</a>, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at <a href="http://www.icann.org/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/index.html</a>.  You agree that we may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws. One of the ways that we may make some or all of the information you provide available to the public or third parties is by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us. Please <a href="mailto:legal@name-services.com">click here</a> if you would like your WHOIS information made available for bulk access. We reserve the right to discontinue providing bulk WHOIS data access to third parties.<br><br>

			OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION AND DATA: You agree and acknowledge that we own all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain name database, and all information and derivative works generated from the domain name database. You further agree and acknowledge that we own the following information for those registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration, (b) the expiration date of the registration, (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of all contacts for the domain name registration, (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain name that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database, and (e) any other information we generate or obtain in connection with the provision of domain name registration services, other than the domain name being registered, the IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name, and the corresponding names of those nameservers. We do not have any ownership interest in your specific personal registration information outside of our rights in our domain name database.<br><br>

			AGENTS AND LICENSES: You agree that, if you are registering a domain name for or on behalf of someone else, you represent that you have the authority to nonetheless bind that person as a principal to all terms and conditions provided herein. You agree that if you license the use of the domain name registered to you to a third party, you nonetheless remain the domain name holder of record, and remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing (and updating, as necessary) both your own full contact information, and accurate technical, administrative, billing and zone contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name and domain name registration.<br><br>

			USE OF FREE SERVICES: In consideration for providing additional optional Services for which we do not charge an additional fee, including, but not limited to, URL forwarding, email forwarding, free parking page, free website hosting, free email services, or other services which we may introduce from time to time but for which there is not a separate fee ("Free Services"), you agree that, if you use such Free Services, we may display advertising in conjunction therewith through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, appendices to emails, or other similar advertising means, and that we may aggregate related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.    You agree that from time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) services ("Promotional Name(s)").  If we do so, the services for the Promotional Name(s) will be placed in the same account as your other domain name(s) and you will be listed as the registrant, though we may point the Promotional Name to IP address(es)of our choosing.  If you want to assume control over the services provided to the Promotional Name, including the right to transfer or push the Promotional Name service to other registrars or other accounts or the ability to control the DNS settings for the Promotional Name, you must pay the promotional registration fee or renewal fee, if any, and agree to the terms of this Agreement with respect to such Promotional Name(s).  If you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may  request that you  be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we will be listed as  the domain name registrant.  Alternatively, you may contact us or your Primary Service Provider to request that we delete the Promotional Name from the namespace.  For any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, you agree that we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid. <br><br>

			AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION: Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry's database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.<br><br>

			<p>Reactivation Period Process. For a period of approximately 30 days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed. You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the "reactivation period."  You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services. You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to offer a reactivation period and that we shall not be liable therefore. You acknowledge that reactivation period renewal processes, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine. You acknowledge and agree that we may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, that we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period),  and/or that expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.</p>

			<p>After the reactivation period, you agree that we may either (i) discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter, (ii) that we may pay the registry's registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued, or, (iii) if we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, that we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.</p>

			<p>In the case of (i), above, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed.  You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, participate in this process, typically called the "Redemption Grace Period" ("RGP"). You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your domain name registration services and that we shall not be liable therefore. If available, RGP typically ends between 30 and 42 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services, as the reactivation period applied to you. The typical RGP fee is $160 plus any registration fees. You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued.  </p>

			<p>In the case of (ii), above, you acknowledge that we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, that we set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.  You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result.  You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued.  In this case, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period ("ERGP"), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay a fee of $160 (US dollars) plus any registration fees. After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services.</p>

			<p>In the case of (iii), above, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings.  You may recover the domain name registration services for a period of up to 42 days after the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you. You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned. You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result of such an auction.  To exercise your rights to recover auctioned domain name services, you must contact us and provide us with a certified letter addressed to "Expiration Recovery" and including documents setting forth your identity and address, which identity and address must be the same as that of the registrant as it was listed in the WHOIS information for the domain name services prior to expiration, a copy of a commonly accepted (in the United States) picture ID (such as a drivers license or passport) which supports your identity and address claim, a front and back photocopy of your credit card and you must a statement authorizing payment of the reinstatement fee to such credit card, which is $160 plus any registration fees.  In doing so, you must provide us with sufficient time to allow us to receive and evaluate your documents and to contact the auction winner prior to the end of 30 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.</p>

			LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:<br><br>

			<p>YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (1) SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICES, (2) USE OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICES, (3) INTERRUPTION OF OUR SERVICES OR INTERRUPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS, (4) ACCESS DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEB SITE(S) OR SERVICE(S) OR DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS YOU EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO A DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED WITH US; (5) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM ACTS OF OR EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL (6) DATA NON-DELIVERY, MIS-DELIVERY, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION OR OTHER MODIFICATION; (7) THE PROCESSING OF AN APPLICATION FOR A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION; (8) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD; OR (9) APPLICATION OF THE DISPUTE POLICY.  YOU ALSO AGREE THAT NEITHER WE NOR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER  HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR REGISTRATION OF THE DOMAIN NAME, BUT IN NO EVENT GREATER THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ($400.00 US Dollars). BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR AND/OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

			<p>INDEMNITY: With respect to ICANN, the registry operators, us, and your Primary Service Provider, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates of such parties, you agree to release, indemnify, and hold such parties harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorney's fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Service(s) provided hereunder, or your use of the Service(s), including, without limitation, infringement by you, or by anyone else using the Service(s) we provide to you, of any intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of our operating rules or policies relating to the Service(s) provided. When we may be involved in a suit involving a third party and which is related to our Service(s) to you under this Agreement, we may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to indemnify and hold us harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph.   Such written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment.  Your failure to provide such assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of this Agreement by you and may, in our sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which we are the registrar of record. This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the UDRP. </p>

			<p>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOU REPRESENT THAT, TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF, NEITHER THE REGISTRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME NOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED NOR THE USE OF OTHER OF THE SERVICE(S) INFRINGES THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY. YOU FURTHER REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PROCUREMENT OF THE SERVICE(S) IS ACCURATE. ALL SERVICE(S) ARE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" AND WITH ALL FAULTS. EXCEPT FOR OUR STATEMENT REGARDING OUR ACCREDITATION AS ICANN-APPROVED DOMAIN NAME REGISTRARS, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, UNLESS SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE NOT LEGALLY EXCLUDABLE. WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER THAT REGISTRATION OR USE OF A DOMAIN NAME UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL IMMUNIZE YOU EITHER FROM CHALLENGES TO YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, OR FROM SUSPENSION, CANCELLATION OR TRANSFER OF THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED TO YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR E-MAIL FORWARDING OR OTHER EMAIL SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL AND/OR DATA. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICE(S) OR ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICE(S). NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

			GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION FOR DISPUTES: Except as otherwise set forth in the UDRP or any similar ccTLD policy with respect to any dispute over a domain name registration this Agreement, your rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Washington, as if the Agreement was a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Washington. You agree that any action brought by you to enforce this Agreement or any matter brought by you and which is against or involves us and which relates to your use of the Services shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, or if there is no jurisdiction in such court, then in a state court in King County, Washington state.  You consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of any state or Federal court in King County, Washington state in relation to any dispute between you and us under this Agreement.

	     <span class="terms_title">Refund Policy</span><br>
    <br>
    At RUNHOSTING.COM we take great value
    in delighting our customers. Below you
    can read our Refund Policy.<br>
    <br>
    <ol><li type="1"><b>Web Hosting Accounts</b><br>
    All newly registered accounts
    as well as upgrades from free to paid accounts are
    subject to 30 days money back guarantee. In case
    you become dissatisfied with our services at any
    point within the first 30 days, you will receive
    a 100% refund for the hosting account.<br>
    <br>
    In case of web hosting renewals (after one or more
    billing cycles), the account is not subject to 30 
    days money back guarantee, hence the rule for the 
    first 30 days does not apply.<br>
    </li><br>
    <li type="1"><b>Domain Names</b><br>
    <b>Domain name sales are final and
    non-refundable</b>. At the time of purchase you are
    the sole owner of the domain(s) purchased through
    our service. In case you decide to leave our hosting
    service at the end of your billing cycle or 
    take advantage of the 30 days money back guarantee,
    domain names are transferable to another provider.<br>
    <br>
    Changes to registered domain names i.e. incorrect spelling, 
    cannot be made once the domain has been purchased. Please 
    explicitly verify the spelling of your domain name before
    purchase.<br>
    </li><br>
    <li type="1"><b>Free Domain Names</b><br>
    In case you get free domain
    name within a web hosting package purchased, 
    and you  decide to take advantage of the 30 days
    money back guarantee, you absolutely agree and
    understand that domain name registrations are
    non-refundable. Therefore upon requesting a refund 
    based on 30 days money back guarantee, you agree 
    to deposit the amount of $19.95 for the domain 
    name registration before a refund for the hosting 
    account is issued.</li></ol>	 </div>
	 
	 <div id="provisioning_and_invoicing" style="visibility:hidden; display:none;">
	 <span class="terms_title">Provisioning and Invoicing</span><br>

    page and via e-mail (the e-mail address you have provided during the registration process).
    The thank-you page and the thank-you e-mail message include instructions about your order
    approval and activation.<br></li>
    <br>
    <li type="1"><b>Sales Receipt</b><br>

    also a sales receipt via e-mail (the e-mail address you have provided during the registration
    process) containing information about the charges made and items ordered.<br></li>
    <br>
    <li type="1"><b>Order Review &amp; Approval</b><br>
    A sales representative will review your order and approve it,
    unless further confirmation is needed (e.g. confirmation over the phone). Please note that the
    account features won't be activated before the order is approved! However, you can login and
    check the status of your account.<br>
    <br>

    trouble ticketing system in your Hosting Control Panel, our sales email sales@supportindeed.com
