<p align="center"><b>COMPETITOR GROUP ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p><b>Last Updated:</b>&nbsp; July 22, 2014</p>
<p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Competitor Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Competitor Group” or “we”) from the Sites.  This Policy applies to consumer users of the Competitor Group’s websites with links to this Policy, including, but not limited to, competitor.com,  velonews.com, triathlete.com, womensrunning.com and websites for Competitor Group events (e.g., Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon, Carlsbad 5000, Endurance Live, ING KiDS ROCK, Muddy Buddy Adventure Series, NationsTri, NFL Run Series, TriRock Triathlon series, Women’s Running Series) (collectively, “Sites”). This Policy does not apply to raceit.com or any other websites, applications or services that do not display or link to this Policy or that display or link to different privacy policy. By using the Sites, you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Information Collected by Us</b></p>
<p><b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Information You Provide.</b>&nbsp; We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Sites.  We collect personal information you provide to use.  For instance, if you register for a Competitor Group event, we will collect your username, password, name, email address, phone number, birth date, gender, emergency contact information, and other information you provide during registration. We also collect credit card number, billing address, and other payment information if you purchase products or services on our Sites.  If you enter into a promotion, contest or sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) sponsored by Competitor Group, we will collect information you provide for such Sweepstakes. We also collect information you provide us in newsletter sign-ups, feedback forms, emails, and surveys.  We may also obtain information from other sources (e.g., from our Registration Partners, Marketing Partners, and Sweepstakes Partners) or from you offline (e.g., at events) and combine that with information we collect on our Sites.</p>
<p><b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Information Automatically Collected.</b>&nbsp; When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected.  For example, when you visit our Sites, your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, access times, browser type and language, operating system, domain name, and the website you visited before you visited our Sites are logged automatically.  We also collect information about your usage and activity on our Sites:</p>
<p><b>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Cookies</b>.&nbsp; We may automatically collect information using “cookies.”  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website.  Among other things, we use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as what items consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our Sites, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our Sites, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites.</p>
<p><b>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Web Beacons.&nbsp; </b>We may collect information using Web beacons (aka clear gifs). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our Sites or in our emails. We use Web beacons to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>
<p><b>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Google Analytics</b>.&nbsp; We use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Sites.  Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Sites, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and services. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.  We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal data. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Social Networks.</b>&nbsp; If you log in to one of the Sites with your login credentials from a social networking site (“SNS”), such as Facebook or Google+, we may receive personal and anonymous data about you from the SNS.  We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Sites, and we may use it as described in this Policy.  We are not responsible for any errors in the information your SNS provides to us.  We may provide information about you to your SNS in accordance with your request (e.g., if you want to post something from our Sites to your Facebook wall), for your SNS’s own use, which will be subject to the SNS’s privacy policy.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for any SNS’s use of information we provide to it or for whether SNS complies with its own privacy policy.</p>
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Third Parties</b></p>
<p><b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Third Party Advertisements.&nbsp; </b>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Sites. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to our Sites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Sites (but not your name, address, email address, or telephone number). They do this using Cookies, clear gifs, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Sites and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies, clear gifs, or other technologies in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies, clear gifs, and other technologies.
