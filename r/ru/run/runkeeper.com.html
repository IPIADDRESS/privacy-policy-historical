               <h3>Our Policy</h3>
               <p>Through the Runkeeper.com website (the “Site”), we may provide you with access to varied user-generated and other content and interactive and informational resources (collectively, "Services"). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from you when using the Site.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in the Runkeeper.com End User Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Site. </p>
               <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
               <p>When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
               <p><em>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site</em>: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily choose to provide such information such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever we collect Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data through the Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to our offices and servers or those of our affiliates or contractors located in the United States and other countries.</p>
               <p><em>Other Information</em>:</p>
               <p><em>Non-Identifiable Data</em>: When you utilize the Site, we may receive certain personally non-identifiable information about your use of the Site. Such information, which may be &nbsp;collected passively using various technologies, or via submission of data by fitness devices you have configured to work with the Site, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. We may store such information ourselves or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
               <p>In operating this Site, we may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer or computers that host our Site give to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.

This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
               <h3>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>
               <p>We will use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

We may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.</p>
               <p>We will communicate with you through email and notices posted via the Services. These communications may include a series of welcome emails which help inform you about various features of the Services. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from us related to the proper functioning of your account.

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we may need to provide them with access to certain Personal Data. However, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
               <p>Legal Requirements: We may also disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>
               <h3>Your Choices</h3>

               <p>When You sign up for our Services that require registration, we ask you to provide Personal Data. If we want to use this Personal Data in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, we will ask for your consent prior to doing so.

               <h3>Exclusions</h3>
               <p>This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us through this Site or to through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively, "Public Areas"), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing services, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"), including all User Content, as that term is defined in our Terms of Use, that by its nature is accessible or intended to be accessible to other users of the Site. All such Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. Please also note that any Personal Data or other information you provide to be displayed in your publicly available online profile will be displayed for others to see and thus will not be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

As such, we advise that you exercise great care in determining what information you choose to make publicly available through this Site.</p>
               <h3>Children</h3>
               <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 and do not target our websites to children under 13.

               <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
               <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. The Site may frame or contain references or links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites").

               <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These steps include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store Personal Data. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be secure. Therefore, you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet.</p>
               <p>We restrict access to Personal Data to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline if they fail to meet those obligations. </p>
               <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
               <p>We process Personal Data only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the Personal Data needed to provide or improve our Services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their Personal Data whenever necessary.</p>
