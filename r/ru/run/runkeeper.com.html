        <h4 id="social-media">Social media</h4>
        
        <p>When you participate in various social media
        forums like Facebook, Twitter, Yammer, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.,
        you should be familiar with and understand the tools provided by those sites
        that allow you to make choices about how you share the personal data in your
        social media profile(s).</p>
        
        <p>ASICS is bound by the privacy practices or
        policies of these third parties, so we encourage you to read the applicable
        privacy notices, terms of use and related information about how your personal
        data is used in these social media environments.</p>
        
        <p>Also, depending on the choices you have made
        regarding your settings on various social media sites (and/or in combination
        with your settings on the ASICS pages), certain personal data may be shared
        with ASICS about your online activities and social media profiles (e.g.
        interests, marital status, gender, user name, photo, comments and content you
        have posted/shared etc.).</p>
        
        <h4 id="if-you-are-under-16-years-of-age">IF YOU ARE UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE</h4>
        
        <p>Our online Services are not directed to children
        under 13 years of age.&nbsp; If you believe we
        have collected information about a child under the age of 13, please contact us
        (see ‘<a href="#data-protection-officer-contact-and-queries">Data Protection Officer - Contact and Queries</a>’ below) so that we may take
        appropriate steps to delete such information.</p>
        
        <p>If you are at least 13 but under 16 years of
        age, please get the consent of your parent or legal guardian before you give us
        any personal data about yourself. Your parent or guardian should contact the
        ASICS company responsible for using your
        personal data – the overview of the applicable ASICS companies can be found <a href="/privacypolicy?annex1=">here</a> and
        provide us with their name, e-mail address and any other identifying
        information that we may request. ASICS needs this information in order to
        verify that they have provided the necessary consent. We may follow up by phone
        or other means in some circumstances. If you are at least 13 but under 16 years
        of age, do not contact us or provide us with any personal data until after your
        parent or guardian has sent us an e-mail consenting to your contact and provision
        of such information.</p>
        
        <h4 id="international-transfers-of-data">INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
        
        <p>Please be informed that we transfer and process any personal data you
        provide to us to countries other than your country of residence. The laws of
        these countries may not afford the same level of protection to your personal
        data. ASICS will therefore seek to ensure that all adequate safeguards are in
        place and that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in
        connection with such transfer. More in particular for data transferred from
        the EU to countries outside the EU, ASICS is using Intra Group Data Transfer
        Agreements based on EU Model Clauses.</p>
        
        <h4 id="security">SECURITY</h4>
        
        <p>ASICS will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal data are
        properly secured using appropriate technical, physical, and organizational
        measures, so that they are protected against unauthorised or unlawful use,
        alteration, unauthorised access or disclosure, accidental or wrongful
        destruction, and loss. Your personal data will be retained for as long as
        required for the above purposes or in so far as such is necessary for
        compliance with statutory obligations and for solving any disputes.</p>
        
        <h4 id="data-retention">DATA RETENTION</h4>
        
        <p>ASICS retains your personal data for as long as required to satisfy the
        purpose for which they were collected and used (for example, for the time
        necessary for us to send you the newsletters you subscribed to, to provide you
        with customer service, answer queries or resolve technical problems, etc.),
        unless a longer period is necessary for our legal obligations or to defend a
        legal claim.</p>
        
        <p>If you have created an ASICS ID account or another ASICS account with us,
        we will delete that account and your personal data upon your request or 30 days
        after it has become inactive. We will consider your account ‘inactive’ when you
        haven’t used your ASICS ID account or another ASICS account for a period of 2
        years. Before your account becomes inactive, we will notify you to use your
        ASICS ID or another ASICS account to prevent your account from being
        inactive. When we cancel your account, your personal data will be deleted, such
        with the exception of your account data and your training and running
        data in case you are using the RunKeeper app, which data will be stored for an
        additional 4 years after your account becomes inactive (unless you ask us to delete
        your data earlier). Also, if we need to store certain types of your personal
        data for a longer period due to legal requirements, we will store such data in
        accordance with the mandatory periods.</p>
        
        <h4 id="your-rights">YOUR RIGHTS</h4>

        <p>To the extent that we are relying on our legitimate interests to use your
        personal data, you also have the right to object to such use (unless we can
        either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the use that override your
        interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the
        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims). </p>
        
        <p>Without undue delay and not later than within a month, we will respond to
        your request to invoke your rights consistent with applicable law.&nbsp; </p>
        
        <p>You may revoke your consent for receiving
        marketing communications at any time, free of charge by following the

        preferences in your profile settings. ASICS will then stop applying the
        research results to you at an individual level and will stop sending you
        marketing communications.</p>
        
        <p>In case you wish to revoke your consent to ASICS using your health data
        or location data, you can send an email to the ASICS company responsible for using your personal
