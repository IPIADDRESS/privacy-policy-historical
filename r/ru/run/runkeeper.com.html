         FitnessKeeper, Inc. ("<strong>FitnessKeeper</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>
         ", "<strong>we</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>") provides users with
         information, services, and tools through the Runkeeper.com website, the

         application programming interface ("<strong>API</strong>"), and other
         websites, apps, and online services that link to this Privacy Policy
         (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>"). This Privacy Policy sets
         forth our policies with respect to how we collect, use, and share
         information through the Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by
         reference in the Runkeeper.com End User	<a href="https://runkeeper.com/termsofservice">Terms of Use</a>, which

         By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, as defined below, you are
         consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you

         such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to our

         the United States and other countries. Those countries may have data
         protection laws that are different from those in your country of residence.
         If you would like us to cease using your Personal Data, you may delete your

            parties to analyze the location data that we collect in order to
            develop new products and services (such as identifying nearby or
            recommended running routes). To provide these location-based features
            and engage in such analysis, FitnessKeeper and our affiliates,
            partners, and licensees may collect, use, and share location data,
            including the real-time, precise geographic location of your mobile

         service providers. We may use such information and pool it with additional
         information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the

            This may include data such as your IP address, the pages you visit or
            features you use within the Services, the date and time of your
            activities on the Services, the URLs from the websites you visit before

            <strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>
            <em>: </em>
            In providing the Services, we may use cookies. Cookies are small files
            that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device by your
            web browser. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the
            Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more accurately. For
            instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you
            from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once
            during a visit to the site. Cookies also can be used to collect
            information about your use of the Services during your current session
            and over time (including the web pages you view and the files you
            download), the operating system and browser type of your computer or
            other device, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP
            address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited
            before the Services, and the link you used to leave the Services. In
            addition to cookies used by FitnessKeeper, we permit third parties to
            set cookies, too (see below). On most web browsers, you will find a
            "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for
            information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new
            cookie and how to refuse some or all cookies, or to delete existing
            cookies from your device. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
            because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services'
            features.

            <strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong>
            <em>: </em>
            The Services or the emails that you receive from us may use an
            application known as a "web beacon" (also known as a "clear gif" or
            "pixel tag"). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists
            of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an
            email to set or access cookies or transmit information, which could
            include Personal Data. For example, it allows an email sender to
            determine whether a user has opened a particular email. In addition to
            web beacons used by FitnessKeeper, we permit third parties to use web
            beacons, too (see below).

            <strong><em>Collaboration with Third-Party Data Collectors</em></strong><em>: </em>
            We also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and
            use some of the information described in this section. For example, we
            may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons or other
            tracking mechanisms (such as tags or scripts) on the Services or in
            email communications from us, or we may allow third parties to use an
            application software development kit (SDK) or a server-to-server
            connection to collect information, including device identifiers such as
            IDFA and Advertising ID. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in
            our Apps to allow third parties to collect information about how users
            interact with the app, and a server-to-server connection enables us to
            exchange data with third parties when an SDK integration is not
            feasible or practical. The information collected by third parties using
            these technologies may be used for a variety of purposes, including
            analytics and targeted interest-based advertising, as discussed below
            (see the section entitled "Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and

         content and information, please send us an email at	<a href="mailto:info@runkeeper.com">info@runkeeper.com</a> with a short
         description of the content or information you would like to have removed.
         Please note that such a request does not necessarily ensure complete or
         comprehensive removal of content posted by you, since the content and
         information may remain in our databases, may remain visible in a manner
         that does not identify you, or may have been re-posted by another user.
      </p>
      <p>
         Users may have additional rights to access, review, correct, delete, or
         inquire about information that we hold about them. To make such a request,
         please send us an email at	<a href="mailto:info@runkeeper.com">info@runkeeper.com</a>. Please note
         that we may need to verify your identity or request additional information
         from you before we are able to comply with your request.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Data Retention and Deletion</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to deliver our
         Services to you or to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy. For
         example, we may retain your profile information and information about your
         fitness activities for as long as you maintain your Runkeeper account. This
         provides you with the ability to review your activities over time, track
         your progress toward personal goals and challenges, and remember your past
         achievements and milestones (for example, your first run, 5K, marathon, or
         other personal achievements).
      </p>
      <p>
         Because our users may take extended breaks from fitness activities and may
         use our Apps on various devices, we do not delete information automatically
         based on account inactivity or when you uninstall our Apps from one of your
         devices. However, we provide you with the ability to delete information
         associated with your account, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>
               You may remove a specific fitness activity from your account, such
               as a walk, run, or other activity on a specific date and time, by
               following the instructions
            </strong>
            <strong> </strong>
            <a href="https://support.runkeeper.com/hc/en-us/articles/201654876-How-To-Delete-An-Activity">
               <strong>here</strong>
            </a>
            <strong>.</strong>
         </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>You may delete your Runkeeper account, and information associated with your account, by following the instructions</strong>
            <a href="https://support.runkeeper.com/hc/en-us/articles/201109826-How-to-delete-your-Runkeeper-Account"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         If you choose to delete your Runkeeper account, we will make our best
         effort to delete all information associated with your account, including
         your profile information, historical fitness activities, historical
         location information, and third-party authorizations for services connected
         to your account (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Fitbit, and Garmin). However,
         please note that certain information may be retained in backup databases or
         for analytics purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
         In limited circumstances, we may retain information for a longer period of
         time as required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Security</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to
         protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and
         unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no
         Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free.
         Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you
         send to us via e-mail or the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Data Integrity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         We process Personal Data for our legitimate business purposes and in
         accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy
         notice. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we
         process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to
         update or correct their Personal Data whenever necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Health Information</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         We do not use information collected through the Services to infer health
         information that we consider sensitive, such as a user's past, present or
         potential future health or medical condition or treatment, including but
         not limited to genetic, genomic, and family medical history. We may,
         however, infer a user's potential interest in certain non-sensitive health
         and wellness categories, such as exercise and fitness activities, endurance
         activities, distance running, diet and weight loss, nutrition, healthy
         living, or physical and massage therapy. We may use this non-sensitive
         health and wellness information for the purpose of delivering more relevant
         content, services, offers, and advertising to our users.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Children</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13
         and do not target our Services to children under 13. If you are under 13,
         please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage
         parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and
         to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never
         provide Personal Data through any of our Services without their permission.
         If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
         Personal Data to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that
         information from our databases.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Links to Other Websites or Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the
         Services. The Services may contain references or links to other websites or
         services not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Services"). The
         policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party
         Services. The links from the Services do not imply our review or
         endorsement of the Third Party Services. We suggest contacting those sites
         directly for information on their privacy policies.
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
         Our Services may change from time to time. As a result, we may need to
         change this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update or modify this
         Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. We
         will post any revised Privacy Policy on our website with an "effective
         date" indicating when the changes will take effect. We encourage you to
         review this Privacy Policy periodically, and especially before you provide
         any Personal Data. Your continued use of the Services after a revised
         Privacy Policy becomes effective shall indicate your agreement with the
         terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
      </p>
