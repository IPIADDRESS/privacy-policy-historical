	<p><strong>RunnerSpace.com Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use by  RunnerSpace.com</strong></p>
<p>RunnerSpace collects user submitted  information such as name, email address, and age to authenticate  users and to send notifications to those users relating to the  RunnerSpace service. RunnerSpace also collects other profile data  including but not limited to: personal interests, gender and age in  order to assist users in finding and communicating with each other.</p>

<p>RunnerSpace also logs  non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile  information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and  visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track  usage and improve the website services. This  non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with  third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to  members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring  purposes </p>

<p>User Profile information including  members' pictures and first names are displayed to people in order to  facilitate user interaction in the RunnerSpace members. Email  addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join  RunnerSpace, to add users to members' friends' profiles, and to send  notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting  friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is  not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network  Users within a personal network communicate on RunnerSpace.com with  each other through the RunnerSpace.com service, without disclosing  their email addresses. To facilitate searching and finding friends  and acquaintances on the service, RunnerSpace.com may allow users to  search for other members using first and last name, email address,  and schools and/or companies where users may have attended or worked  in the future.</p>

<p>We may also use a user's email address  to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Users  may choose not to receive email of this type by changing their  "notification" setting to  "Do not send me notification emails" in the user  "http://www.RunnerSpace.com/mySettings.php?do=privacy"</p>

<p><strong>Invitations and Other Communications  to Non-members</strong></p>
<p>RunnerSpace.com members can invite  friends to join the service by sending invitation emails via our  automated invitation system. RunnerSpace.com stores the email  addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added  to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also  to stop them sending further invitations. RunnerSpace.com does not  sell these email addresses or use them to send any other  communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three  (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from  RunnerSpace.com may contact RunnerSpace.com to request the removal of  their information from our database, however we never send more than  one e-mail.</p>
