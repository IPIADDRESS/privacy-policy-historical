<h2 id="q1">WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED?</h2>
<p>Depending on your use of the websites, applications (including mobile apps) and/or other services we, RunningAHEAD, LLC ("RunningAHEAD" "we" or "us" or "our") may make available from time to time (collectively, and together with associated and successor websites, applications and services, the "Service"), we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Personally Identifiable Information </h3>
<p>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Such information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information. </p>
<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information is information that any single of item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (like age, profession, gender, current location, zip code, birth date, or year of birth). Non-personally identifiable information may also include user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, purchasing or usage history and trends, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Service. </p>
<h2 id="q2">WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)?</h2>
<p>We will collect personally identifiable information from you only if you voluntarily submit the information to us. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of the Service. </p>
<h3>Registering to Use the Service and in the Course of Using the Service.</h3>
<p>You may be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the Service. If so, if you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information) such as name, postal address, email address, birth date and credit card and billing information. We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process. In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments.</p>
<h3>Cookies and Action Tags.</h3>
<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information passively using "cookies" and "action tags."</p>
<p>"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Service and other websites. Cookies are used to personalize your experience on the Service (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Service), and to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Service to help us improve our offerings. We also may use cookies to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies that we place on your computer or mobile device, cookies may also be placed on your computer or mobile device by third parties that we use to display or serve advertisements or to collect non-personally identifiable information in order to provide advertising-related services. In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize unique cookies on your browser.</p>
<p>You do not have to accept cookies to use the Service. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the toolbar. While you are not required to accept our cookies to access the Service, if you reject cookies, certain products, offerings, features, or resources of the Service may not work properly and you may experience some loss of convenience.</p>
<p>"Action tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Service, including advertisements, or email sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.</p>
<p>By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns. </p>
<p>Finally, you should be aware that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their websites or services on or from the Service. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use by such third-party websites or services or providers of third-party advertising.</p>

There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<h2 id="q9">COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?</h2>
<p>Personally-identifiable information collected on the Service may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and the Service may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries (such as the United States) that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. By using the Service and submitting such information on it, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information. If you are a user accessing the Service from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from those of the United States, please be advised that all aspects of the Service are governed by the internal laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, regardless of your location.</p>
<h2 id="q10">WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must "opt-in" and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

<p>You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by accessing My Profile or contacting privacy@runningahead.com. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identify before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
<p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable.</p>
<h2 id="q12">HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
<p>You should be aware that we may revise this Privacy Policy at any time. However, we will not make changes that result in significant additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable information without allowing you to "Opt In" to such changes. We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that generally will not significantly affect our use of your personally identifiable information. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.</p>
<h2 id="q13">WHOM DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE ANY PRIVACY QUESTIONS?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or feel that we are not abiding by the terms of this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Agent by sending an email to privacy@runningahead.com</p>
