                    collect and store information about your visit on an
                    anonymous, aggregate basis. This information may
                    include the time and length of your visit, the pages you
                    look at on our sites, and the site you visited just before
                    coming to ours. We may also record the name of your
                    Internet service provider. We use this information only
                    to measure site activity and to develop ideas for
                    improving our sites.

                    There are also several opportunities on our Web sites

                    personal information with us, we may store it and use it
                    for marketing research and other marketing purposes,
                    which may include sharing it with other companies that
                    we do business with, such as advertisers. However, such
                    information is given as statistics only (demographics), with
                    no name or specific E-Mail address associated with it.
                    We will never sell your actual personal information to any
                    other company or identify your statistical information to
