Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</li>

    <li>Service Announcements<br>
    On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related
    announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for
    maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out
    of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However,
    these communications are not promotional in nature. <br> <br> </li>
    <li>Customer Service<br>
    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services
    and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or
    phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</li>

	<li>Legal Disclaimer<br>
    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to
    disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a
    good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current
    judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. <br> <br></li>
    <li>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)<br>
    We share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not
    linked to any personally identifiable information. <br> <br></li>
    <li>Third Party Intermediaries<br>
    We use an outside shipping company to ship orders. These companies do not
    retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
    secondary purposes. <br> <br></li>
    <li>Links<br>
    This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we,
    the RWA, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
    We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
    privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
    identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
    information collected by this Web site.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Security<br>
	This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
    users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is
    protected both online and off-line.<br>
    <br>
    Should you ever be need to provide sensitive information (such as a credit
    card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted
    and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
    While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom
    of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
    becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just
    "surfing". While we currently do not collect any of this type of
    information, it is possible we will provide services requiring this need in
    the future. <br>
    <br>
    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also
    do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our
    users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
    restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to
    perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service
    representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
    Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
    practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our
    employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on
    privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.
    Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a
    secure environment,. <br>
    <br>
    If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can
    send an email to <a href="mailto:support@rwa.org">support@rwa.org</a>     <br>
      <br>
    </li>
<li>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information<br>
    If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,
    phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service,
    we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally
    identifiable information. This can usually be done at the on your profile or
    by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@rwa.org">support@rwa.org</a>. Or, contact us via contact information listed below.
     <br> <br></li>
<li>Notification of Changes<br>
	If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to
    this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate
    so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
    and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use
    information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
    information was collected. <br>
    <br>
    If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information
    in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will
    notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use
    their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out
    of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account,
    then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used
    in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our
    privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our
    database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of
    the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users,
    who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the
    changes in our privacy practices.
