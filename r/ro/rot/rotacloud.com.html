    		<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>
    		<h3>Promotional offers from us</h3>
    		<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). </p>
    		<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us or if you provided us with your details when you registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

    		<h3>Third-party marketing</h3>
    		<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the RotaCloud group of companies for marketing purposes.</p>

    		<h3>Opting out</h3>
    		<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by <a href="https://rotacloud.com/contact/">contacting us</a> at any time.</p>
    		<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a purchase or other transaction.</p>

    		<h3>Cookies</h3>
    		<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see <a href="/cookies/">our cookie policy</a>.</p>

    		<h3>Change of purpose</h3>
    		<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please <a href="https://rotacloud.com/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
    		<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
    		<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="data-disclosure">
    		<h2>Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
    		<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
    		<ul style="margin:0 0 16px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
    			<li>External Third Parties as set out in the <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a>.</li>
    			<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="international-transfers">
    		<h2>International transfers</h2>
    		<p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area <b>(EEA)</b> so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
    		<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    		<ul style="margin:0 0 16px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
    			<li>The country shall have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.  For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
    			<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
    			<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>Please <a href="https://rotacloud.com/contact/">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="data-security">
    		<h2>Data security</h2>
    		<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    		<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="data-retention">
    		<h2 class="text-title">Data retention</h2>

    		<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
    		<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
    		<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [Request erasure] below for further information.</p>
    		<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="legal-rights">
    		<h2>Your legal rights</h2>
    		<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to view more about these rights in the glossary.</p>
    		<ul style="margin:0 0 16px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
    			<li><a href="#legal-rights">Request access to your personal data</a></li>
    			<li><a href="#legal-rights">Request correction of your personal data</a></li>
    			<li><a href="#legal-rights">Request erasure of your personal data</a></li>

    		</ul>
    		<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please <a href="https://rotacloud.com/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

    		<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
    		<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

    		<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
    		<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

    		<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
    		<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
    	</section>
    	<section id="glossary">
    		<h2 class="text-title">Glossary</h2>

    		<h3>LAWFUL BASIS</h3>
    		<p><b>Legitimate Interest</b> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="https://rotacloud.com/contact/">contacting us</a></p>
    		<p><b>Performance of Contract</b> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
    		<p><b>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</b> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>

    		<h3>THIRD PARTIES</h3>
    		<p><b>External Third Parties</b></p>
    		<ul style="margin:0 0 16px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
    			<li>Service providers acting as processors based in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the USA who provide customer support and communication services.</li>
    			<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the United Kingdom who provide legal, banking, insurance and accounting services.</li>
    			<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom.</li>
    		</ul>
    		<h3 id="legal-rights">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
    		<p>You have the right to:</p>
    		<p><b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
    		<p><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
    		<p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
    		<p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
    		<p><b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
    		<p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
    		<p><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
