<p><span class="largeHeader"><b>Security Policy for Rogers Video,
a division of Rogers Communications Inc.</span></b></p>

<p><span class="subhead"><b>Rogers Communications Inc. Security Policy</span></b></p>

Rogers Video, a division of Rogers Communications Inc., develops and operates the www.rogers.com/video Web site (also known as the <a href="www.rogersvideo.ca">www.rogersvideo.ca</a> Web site) (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;). 


<p><span class="subhead"><b>Security</span></b></p>

<p>The Site uses the latest available Internet technology to help ensure that your personal and payment information is kept confidential and secure. The Site has been designed to safeguard your information from the time you log-on to the Site through strict security practices. Your transactions are protected behind a series of screening routers and firewall devices comprised of the latest Internet security technologies available. All customer-related data is stored in separate secured database servers, located safely behind these firewalls. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for further details on how your personal information is used and protected.</p>


<p><span class="subhead"><b>Peace of Mind When Shopping at the Site</span></b></p>

<p>When you provide us with any personal information - your name, address, e-mail and credit card number - it's done on a secure server. In addition, the Site uses VeriSign's "Secure Site" certificate service to authenticate the identity of the Site&rsquo;s server. According to VeriSign, using the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol, the VeriSign "Secure Site" certificate enables a "secure pipe" between your browser and the Site&rsquo;s server for the duration of your login session, which provides confidentiality and assurance that your identity has not changed since the login beginning the session. This helps to ensure that sensitive data transmitted between the Site and your browser is secure. VeriSign is the leading supplier of secure communications over the Internet today. The &ldquo;Secure Site&rdquo; certificate is explained in more detail on the VeriSign home page at http://www.verisign.com. </p>


<p><span class="subhead"><b>Unauthorized Use of Your Credit Card - Our Policy</span></b></p>

<p>Most financial institutions or credit card providers either cover all charges resulting from unauthorized use of your credit card or limit your liability to $50 Cdn.

</p><ul>
	<li>We use cookies to remind us who you are and to find your account information in our database when you access a service so you do not need to log in at every visit. This helps us to provide you with service tailored to your specific needs and interests. A cookie is created when you register for a service. </li>
	<li>We use cookies to estimate our audience size. Your browser is given a unique cookie that helps us determine whether yours is a repeat visit or a first visit. </li>
	<li>We use cookies to determine the browser the visitor uses so the site can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers. </li>
	<li>Advertisers that place ads with Rogers.com/video may use cookies </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Our site's registration forms require users to give us a unique username and password. To post a message in the site using an e-form, an email address is also required. </p>

<p>This site contains links to third party sites. Rogers.com/video is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Rogers.com/video co-branded sites and content partner sites may have privacy policies independent of Rogers.com/video. This Privacy Policy extends only to data collected on pages hosted on Rogers.com/video servers. Rogers.com/video may share aggregate information with trading partners, co-branded sites, and advertisers. However, this aggregated information does not contain personally identifiable information. </p>

<p>Our online surveys and the contests on our site may ask visitors for such information as contact information (like their email address), financial information (like their investment portfolio holdings), and demographic information (like their postal code, age or income level). We may use contact data from our surveys or contests to send information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, sponsors or advertisers. The customer's contact information may also be used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other affiliated companies within the Rogers Group of Companies who may want to contact our visitors. Only the Rogers Group of Companies has access to your personal information. Users may opt-out of receiving future e-mail communications. Please see the choice/opt-out section below. </p>

<p>Demographic and profile data is used to tailor our visitor's experience at our site and display the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. </p>

<p><span class="subHead"><b>Public Forums</b></span></p>

<p>This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. </p>

<p><span class="subHead"><b>Security</b></span></p>

<p>This site has reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and interception by third parties. The Rogers Group of Companies assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet. </p>

<p>This site is not marketed to or directed towards children.
