<strong>Our Commitment to Privacy</strong><br>
Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with our users. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services.<br><br>

<strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong><br>
When you visit our site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you actively choose to disclose ("Active Information") and Use information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and others browse our site ("Passive Information").<br><br>

<strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
This refers to information that lets us know who you are or things specifically about you.<br><br>

<strong>A. Registration</strong><br>
When you register to become an authorized reseller of ROI Unlimited products, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number). This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed on our website. You are assigned an identification number and select your own password – both are needed to enter the Site and to access your Contact Information.<br><br>

When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transaction information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate with you about the status of your order.<br><br>

<strong>C. Credit Card Storage</strong><br>
Credit card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only to process payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our Site.<br><br>

<strong>D. Surveys and Promotions</strong><br>
From time to time you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our products and services and to ensure that we’re providing accurate disclosures. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that coincide with your preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences, or let us know if you do not wish to receive any promotional materials, by adjusting your Subscriptions &amp; Email options on the Site.<br><br>

<strong>2. Aggregate Information</strong><br>
This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual.
