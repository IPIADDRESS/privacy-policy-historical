<h1>RoadsideAmerica.com Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="specialnote">This policy describes how www.RoadsideAmerica.com
    treats personal information www.RoadsideAmerica.com collects and receives.
  Personal information is information
    about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email
  address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
<p class="specialnote">This
    policy does not apply to the practices of web sites RoadsideAmerica.com does
    not own or control, or to people that RoadsideAmerica.com does not employ
      or manage. In addition, companies providing hotel booking, car rental,
  and merchandise to RoadsideAmerica.com in an affiliate relationship have their
      own privacy statements
      which can be viewed by clicking on the links on those sites.</p>
<h2>Information
    Collection and Use</h2>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com collects personal information from
    you when you submit a tip, photo, video, feedback form or email, which may include
    your name, email
          address
        and other personal information. </p>
<p>For your privacy protection we do not
    publish your email address without your consent. If you submit
        a tip accompanied by an
            explicit request to publish your email address, the decision to publish
          that information is solely at our discretion.</p>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com collects
    publicly available information on tourist businesses and public attractions
    that is published with reports and
            tips on those attractions.
        We make every effort to assure this information is accurate, but make
  no warranty to its validity and provide the information as is. <span class="relatedlinks">See our <a href="/terms.html" target="_top">Terms
  and Conditions</a> for more information.</span></p>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com
    collects personal information when you register  when you enter promotions
      or sweepstakes. When you register
              we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth
  date, gender, zip code, and travel interests. We may combine information
              about you
              that we have with information we obtain from business partners
  or other companies.</p>
<p>RoadsideAmerica.com may collect anonymous data from you in the process of delivering
  a service you are using. For example,  for you to email a My Sights
  trip to a friend, RoadsideAmerica.com stores the trip name and attraction ID
  numbers -- but no email
  addresses or other personal information.</p>

                and the
                page you request. We may use information for the following general
                purposes: to customize the advertising and content, improve our
                services, conduct
                research, and provide
        anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
