<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2"><b><a name="what"></a>What personally identifiable information does Roadfly.org collect from me?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">Roadfly.org collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, Roadfly.org asks for your name and e-mail address, among other personal information. The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to Roadfly.org--you are given a Roadfly.org ID number and User Name and are able to take full advantage of Roadfly.org's many offerings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times; for example when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by Roadfly.org; when you make a purchase from the Roadfly.org store; when you post a Roadfly.org classified ad.; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact Roadfly.org, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever Roadfly.org collects personal information, an effort is made to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.</font></p>

</center>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Through the use of cookies Roadfly.org can track and store information about your use of our web site; thus allowing us to customize and tailor certain services to you. Any Roadfly.org site that requires you to log-in or a site that is customizable requires that your computer accepts cookies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">Generally, Roadfly.org uses cookies to:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your Roadfly.org account information (stored on our computers). Upon "Sign In", the cookie is set and is modified upon "Sign Out". Roadfly.org also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages and Classifieds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Roadfly.org is given a unique cookie, which is used to determine the extent of repeat usage by a registered user and to track advertising based on user interests and behavior.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(3) Assist Roadfly.org's store to track visits and to process any items in your shopping basket. The information collected by cookies may also provide information to us regarding which pages you have been viewing in our store.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(4) Track entries and submissions to promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a Roadfly.org-hosted promotion or contest uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates a contestant's status through the event.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(5) Measure traffic patterns regarding Roadfly.org's network of web sites--i.e. where you have visited and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand our users' habits so that we may improve the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss" size="2">(6) Advertising networks that serve ads on Roadfly.org may also use their own cookies to to track trends in a similar matter.</font></p>
