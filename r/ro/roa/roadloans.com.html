        <h3>Information we May Disclose to Affiliates Within Our Family of Companies</h3>
        <p>One category of information about you is based on our direct transactions, experiences and dealings with you, such as your identification and contact information, loan or application status, loan balances, or payment history (what we refer to as “Transaction Information”). Another category of information about you is not based directly on our transactions or experiences with you, such as information about you provided by a consumer reporting agency or information about your income, assets, or liabilities that you provide in your application (“Other Information”). </p>
        <p>We may share Transaction Information and Other Information within the family of companies related to us by common control or ownership (our “Affiliates”), both for our everyday business purposes and in connection with products and services they might offer. </p>

        <p>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose all of the information we collect about you, as described above, to select financial service providers that participate in joint marketing programs with us to jointly offer you financial products or services.

If we make these disclosures, we may receive compensation. </p>
        <p>With your consent or at your direction, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated automobile dealers participating in our RoadLoans program and nonaffiliated financial institutions and creditors that may be able to provide you with a financial product or service that we cannot or do not provide. If we make these disclosures, we may receive compensation. </p>
