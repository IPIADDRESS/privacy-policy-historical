  <p>We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part. We take this trust very seriously, and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us. Before submitting your personal information to our Web site, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting Roaming Hunger’s Web site, <a href="http://www.roaminghunger.com" target="_blank">www.roaminghunger.com</a>, you are accepting the practices described herein.</p>

  <h2 class="subhead"><span>What information we collect from you</span></h2>
  <p><strong>In General.</strong></p>
  <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password. We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, e-mail Roaming Hunger content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>
  <p><strong>Information About Others.</strong></p>
  <p>You will have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Web site. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Roaming Hunger with their personal information.</p>
  <p><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong></p>
  <p>We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Roaming Hunger by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us. Examples of other information we may receive include contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Web site, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services.</p>

For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site.

Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
