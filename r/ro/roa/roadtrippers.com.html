<p>5.1&nbsp; &nbsp;We aim to provide you with choices about how your personal data is used for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>
<p>5.2&nbsp; &nbsp;You will only receive marketing communications from us if you have opted in or consented to receiving those communications. We may use your personal data collected in those circumstances to contact you and keep you up to date with the latest news, events, special offers and promotions of our brands, including by email, text messages or post.</p>
<p>5.3&nbsp; &nbsp;We may also use your information to contact you about our own and third-parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you.

<p>5.5&nbsp; &nbsp;We may display advertising for you to see on third party websites, including social media sites such as Facebook. We do this by matching information about your activity on TH2 group websites with information collected on third party sites. That may involve using your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Change of purpose</strong></p>
<p>6.1&nbsp; &nbsp;We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider we need to use it for another reason compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us by clicking&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@th2.com?subject=Data%20Privacy%20Request">here</a>.</p>

<p>iii.&nbsp; &nbsp;If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of the TH2 Companies, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

<p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented.</p>
<p>8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</p>
<p>8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we have entered into EU-approved standard contractual clauses with the recipient to give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</p>
<p>8.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they &nbsp;demonstrate an adequate level of data protection in compliance with applicable law.</p>
<p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@th2.com?subject=Data%20Privacy%20Request">contact us</a>&nbsp;if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

<p>a.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Access:&nbsp;</strong>you can request access to a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Correction</strong>: you can request that any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you is corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Erasure</strong>: you can ask us to delete or remove your personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Object to processing</strong>: where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and you believe our processing of your personal data impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms, you may object to such processing for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Restrict processing</strong>: you can ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Data portability</strong>: you can request that your personal data is transferred to you or a third party. We will provide you or a third party you have chosen with your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

<p>g.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Withdraw consent</strong>: you may withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data. If you do so, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if that is the case when you withdraw your consent.</p>

<p>9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What we may need from you:</strong>&nbsp;We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>

<p>11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
