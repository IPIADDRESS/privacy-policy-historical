<h2>How and why personal information is used</h2>
<p><strong>This section explains in detail how and why we use personal information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lawful Processing in Europe</strong></p>
<p>Taylor &amp; Francis Group collects and uses personal information. The lawful bases we use for this activity in Europe, as required under European data protection laws, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where it is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you</li>
<li>Where we have a legitimate interest to do so, provided your rights do not override these interests</li>
<li>Where you have consented to its use</li>
<li>Where our colleagues believe it is in your vital interests to share your personal details, for example with emergency services</li>
<li>Where required to comply with our legal obligations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Product enquiries, sales and administration</strong></p>
<p>As part of a purchase, product enquiry, request for information and for account administration, we collect information such as your name, country, job title, company information or academic affiliation, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number.</p>
<p>If you have made an enquiry about us or our products or services, either online or over the phone, we will use your personal information to respond to the enquiry or to take other steps at your request, before you enter into a contract. For example, we collect the e-mail addresses and additional contact details of those who send e-mails to request information. Where a sales representative speaks to you over the phone, the calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes only.</p>
<p>If you have registered for or purchased a product or services, including on a trial basis, your personal information will be used to provide that product or service, communicate about it and handle payments, as is necessary for the performance of the contract entered into with us.</p>
<p>For purchases, payment information, including credit/debit card number/bank details and billing addresses are also collected. Where payment card processors are used to facilitate payment card transactions on our websites, your data will be collected and used according to that data processors’ privacy policy.</p>
<p>If your personal information is relevant to certain products and is freely available through public sources, such as on a website related to your work or profession, we may use this personal information for providing customers with our products, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Services</strong></p>
<p>If you publish with us, your personal information is used in connection with the dissemination and promotion of your published work, as is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Your name and affiliation will be published as part of authored work. Personal information is also used to handle payments or for other purposes, as is necessary to perform the contract entered into with us.</p>
<p>In addition, we sometimes take photos and videos at events associated with your published work. Where photos and videos are taken at our events that feature you as an author, we may use those photos and videos for promotional purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We will use your personal information to send you newsletters, offers or other marketing emails that keep you up to date with our news, events and products that may be of interest. Depending on the nature of your interaction with us and the laws of the country where you live, you may have actively given us your consent for this, by opting in, or we may be entitled to rely on your implied consent or our legitimate interests. The opportunity to opt out of future marketing emails will always be provided, and information on how to do this given when your personal information is collected and on every marketing email sent.&nbsp;<a href="http://taylorandfrancis.com/customer-privacy#marketing-preferences">Further information on how to change your marketing preferences is provided in the section below.</a></p>
<p><strong>Customer and Prospects Management including Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We may use your personal information, combined with publicly available data and demographic data, to maintain our customer database and carry out internal analysis of the usage of our products and services. This is done to improve those services, develop new products and predict future customer behavior, as part of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. This may include automated profiling and campaign management techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Applications and Websites Analytics including Location Data</strong></p>
<p>We may combine visitor session information, or other information collected through tracking technologies, with personally identifiable information in order to understand and measure your online experience and determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest.</p>
<p>Technical methods are also used in HTML e-mails sent to visitors, for purposes including: (i) to determine whether visitors have opened or forwarded e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails, (ii) to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after closing an e-mail, and (iii) to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular e-mail.</p>
<p>In compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) (e.g.: Browsers Do Not Track Signals) while we strive to offer you choice when using our website and mobile applications, we do not promise that we will be able to receive or honor web browser Do Not Track signals.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling</strong></p>
<p>We use algorithm-based technologies to personalise dynamic web content based on your explicit and/or implicit interests. We carry out general profiling such as segmentation, non-automated and automated decision-making based on profiling for the purpose of providing you with a more relevant experience and for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a commercial organisation. Automated decision making is never used in any way that produces a legal or similarly significant effect.</p>
<p>Automated decision making, which for example is where your answers to an application to receive a sample inspection copy of a textbook determines whether the request is granted, is implemented in certain cases to ensure we deliver a timely and reliable service to customers.</p>
<p>Depending on the laws of the country where you live, you may have rights related to our decision.&nbsp; For example, if you live in the European Union, you may have the right not to be subject to our decision, or you may have the right to insist on human intervention in the process, express your point of view or contest the decision. To exercise any such right, please contact us via one of the methods set out in the Questions or Complaints section below. In some cases, we may have the right to continue with our decision, in accordance with applicable laws. This will be explained if it is the case. Otherwise, we will respond to your request as promptly as reasonably possible.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with our legal obligations</strong></p>
<p>To ensure compliance with international trade sanction laws and regulations, we screen customers, vendors and suppliers against US, OFAC, BIS, UN, EU and UK sanctions lists. Should any screening check flag an issue where we cannot continue in a contract with a customer or supplier, they will always be informed.</p>
<h2>How we protect personal information</h2>
<p><strong>Any personal information given to us will be treated with the utmost care and security. This section sets out some of the security measures in place.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A variety of physical and technical measures is used to keep data safe and prevent unauthorised access to, or use or disclosure of personal information.</p>
<p>Electronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information, using both physical and electronic means. Our colleagues receive data protection training, and we have detailed security and data protection policies that colleagues are required to follow when handling personal data.</p>
<p>All reasonable steps are taken to ensure that your personal information is kept secure from unauthorised access, but we cannot guarantee it will be secure during the transmission process to this website because this transmission is not controlled by us. We make use of HTTPS (HTTP Secure) whereby the communication protocol is encrypted via Transport Layer Security for secure communication over a computer network. The website is loaded via HTTPS, represented by the lock icon in your web browser, which ensures the transmission is secure and is demonstrated by a certificate issued by an official security certificate authority to us.</p>
<p><strong>International transfer of personal information</strong></p>
<p>As an international business and because of the technologies we use, personal information may be accessed by our colleagues and third-party service providers from locations outside of the European Economic Area, whose data protection laws may not be as extensive as those in Europe.</p>
<p>To ensure the same level of protection is in place when processing is conducted outside the European Economic Area, we use appropriate safeguards approved by the European Commission.</p>
<p>We apply appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with this Policy. Taylor &amp; Francis Group has put in place international data transfer agreements between its companies and with relevant third-party service providers based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>
