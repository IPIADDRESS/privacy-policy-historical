	<h2>Rounds Privacy Policy</h2>
	<h3 class="intro">Last Updated August 10, 2010</h3>
	<p>This privacy statement explains the privacy practices of Rounds for users of the Site. If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Rounds Terms of Use, which is available at <a href="/terms">http://www.rounds.com/terms</a>.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Rounds' Commitment to Privacy</h3>
	<p>Rounds respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Rounds' policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy statement apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">What is Personal Information?</h3>
	<p>Personal Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational and, marital status, age, personal pictures, spoken languages, social preferences and employment history profile. </p>
	<p>Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Collection of Personal Information</h3>
	<p>We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sign up for or renew your Rounds membership;</li>
		<li>register to use the Site;</li>
		<li>install the Facebook application;</li>
		<li>post or submit any content on any part on the Site; </li>
		<li>place an order or purchase products or services online; or contact us for any reason.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We may automatically collect some information when you visit our Site, such as your computer's IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, purchases and activities. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with Rounds. </p>
	<h3 class="intro">Use of Personal Information</h3>
	<p>The personal information we collect is used to process your requests or transactions, to provide you high quality service, to customize the Site according to your preferences, and to tell you about specific goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information (see under the heading “Choice” below).</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Rounds does not sell, rent, share, or disclose Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described in this statement. </p>
	<h3 class="intro">Communities</h3>
	<p>If you use any of the features of the Site or Services, such as video or chat services, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, even without your knowledge or authorization. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. Rounds is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which you disclose in such venues.</p>
	<p>As also noted in our Terms of Use, Rounds reserves the right to use any user-generated content, including content generated by users using Rounds' video chat services, for its own commercial advertising purposes. For example, without limitation, Rounds may use any video chat Snapshots generated by users in any Rounds commercial advertisement, in any manner on the Rounds Site or in other promotional content, all pursuant to Rounds' sole discretion. </p>
	<h3 class="intro">Order Fulfillment</h3>
	<p>We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfill an order you have placed with us.  For example, if you pay by a credit or debit card, your card number and sales transaction information is passed on to the card processor. However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commerce distribution chain only the information they need to provide you the products or services you order, such as your name, shipping and/or billing address, email addresses, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. Rounds is not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information to them.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Other Disclosures</h3>
	<p>In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Rounds, our customers, or the public.  Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Protection of Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Rounds has put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access.</p>
	<p>Further, when you enter personal information online, that information is encrypted using security software called SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL encrypts all information entered on our site before it is sent over the Internet. We also use SSL to allow you to securely view your online account and registration information. </p>
	<p>Account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.  If other people have access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and obtain personal information about you (such as your credit card information), or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such email accounts.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">Choice</h3>
	<p>By registering for the Site you agree to receive promotional messages from Rounds. If at any time you wish to stop receiving promotional information from Rounds, you may opt out by:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>E-Mailing us at support@rounds.com;</li>
		<li>Writing us at: Customer Service, Rounds, Dizengoff St. 99, Tel Aviv, Israel,  or</li>
		<li>Accessing your registration information and checking the box in the setting page (located at http://www.rounds.com/settings) that allows you to opt out of receiving promotional emails.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 class="intro">Aggregate Information</h3>
	<p>Rounds appreciates the importance of safeguarding the privacy of your personal information that may be provided to us.  However, Rounds does use and disclose de-identified aggregate information for the purposes of evaluating and improving our services and tailoring our products. Rounds may choose at its sole discretion to transfer, sell, provide or share such information with third parties, including for to Rounds' business partners for commercial purposes, and by providing any information to Rounds you consent to such provision of de-identified aggregate information to any third party.</p>
	<h3 class="intro">What Are Cookies and Are You Required to Accept Them?</h3>
	<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer. We use cookies to help optimize your use of the Site.  For example, we use cookies to customize our home page for you and to better display pages according to your browser type. When you make a purchase on the Site, cookies allow us to better maintain the status of your account. <strong>We do not use cookies to store any personal information about you.</strong></p>

	<!--
	<h3 class="intro">The Information We Collect</h3>
	<p>When you visit Rounds you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and information collected by us as you interact with our Website.</p>
	<p>When you register, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your birthday, your gender and any other personal or preference information.</p>
	<p>When you use Rounds, we collect your browser type and IP address. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.</p>
	<p>When you use Rounds, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, engage in 1 on 1 sessions, and transmit information through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.</p>
	<p>We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to engage. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
	<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. We will send your friend an email or instant message in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send up to two reminders to them. Rounds stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program.</p>
	
	<h3 class="intro">Use of Information Obtained by Rounds</h3>
	<p>When you register with Rounds, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to enable you to connect with people on Rounds. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Rounds that we think you may find valuable.</p>
	<p>Profile information is used by Rounds primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings.</p>
	
	<h3 class="intro">Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>
	<p>We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Rounds, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Rounds-specified purposes.</li>
		<li>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into Rounds.</li>
		<li>If you or your friends use any third-party applications developed using the Rounds platform, those Applications may access and share certain information about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings. In addition, third party developers who have created and operate Platform Applications, may also have access to your personal information. Before allowing any Platform Developer to make any Platform Application available to you, Rounds requires the Platform Developer to enter into an agreement which, among other things, requires them to respect your privacy settings and strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of your information. However, while we have undertaken contractual and technical steps to restrict possible misuse of such information by such Platform Developers, we of course cannot and do not guarantee that all Platform Developers will abide by such agreements. Please note that Rounds does not screen or approve Platform Developers and cannot control how such Platform Developers use any personal information that they may obtain in connection with Platform Applications. In addition, Platform Developers may require you to sign up to their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies, which may give them additional rights or impose additional obligations on you, so please make sure to review these terms and policies carefully before using any Platform Application. You can report any suspected misuse of information through the Rounds Platform and we will investigate any such claim and take appropriate action against the Platform Developer up to and including terminating their participation in the Rounds Platform and/or other formal legal action.</li>
		<li>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Rounds service. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</li>
		<li>We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers.</li>
		<li>We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Rounds. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Rounds, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you use Rounds, certain information you post or share with third parties, such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, videos or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile this information may become publicly available.</p>
	
	<h3 class="intro">Third Party Advertising</h3>
	<p>Advertisements that appear on Rounds are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Rounds does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Rounds unless you choose to share it with them.</p>
	<p>This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Rounds and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.</p>
	
	<h3 class="intro">Changing or Removing Information</h3>
	<p>Access and control over most personal information on Rounds is readily available through the profile editing tools. Rounds users may modify or delete any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Rounds.</p>
	
	<h3 class="intro">Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</h3>
	<p>Your use of Rounds, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
