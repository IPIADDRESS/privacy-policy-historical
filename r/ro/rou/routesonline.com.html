<h2>Transfers of personal information</h2>
<p>We may share your personal information with any member of the UBM group of companies, including subsidiaries and holding companies, in order to enable you to access the services, provide you with customer support and conduct the other activities described in this privacy policy. Such group companies may be located outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), in which case the section "Where we store your data" below will apply.</p>
<p>We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we may engage Service Providers to provide market research, marketing (including competitions), advertising, communications, event management (including logistics, health and safety and audio-visual services), meetings and bookings (including accommodation), training, IT, hosting and other infrastructure, subscription and discount management, payment processing, and data cleansing and processing services. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal information. These third parties are contractually bound only to use personal information to perform the services that we hire them to provide. We will always use our best efforts to ensure that all the Service Providers we work with will keep your personal data secure.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
<li>if any member of the UBM group or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data about its customers will be one of the transferred assets; and</li>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the UBM group.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use one of our virtual products, e.g. Virtual Exhibitions, Directory Sites, Webinars etc., or choose to allow your badge to be scanned at an event, we may pass the information you provide to third parties. Generally this will be via a process whereby you, as the user, visit or interact with a third party e.g. visit a stand at an online exhibition, have your badge scanned or click on an asset branded and provided by a third party. In some instances, for example, a products listing site, you may reach out directly to a supplier or exhibitor who may contact you in return. In other instances our virtual products are sponsored and, in such cases the data you provided to us will be given to the sponsor. Generally, we will let you know at the time of collection if a product is sponsored. If you wish to change your contact preferences with an individual exhibitor/sponsor, please follow their own unsubscribe request details. Unsubscribing with UBM (UK) Ltd will stop UBM (UK) Ltd from contacting you in the future, but not the individual third parties whom you have interacted with independently.</p>
<h2>Where we store your data</h2>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of services to you or the processing of your payment details. We will take all steps that are mandatory or reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection laws, including, where relevant, entering into EU standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the EEA receiving the data.</p>
<h2>Security of personal information</h2>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised uses, access or modifications.</p>
<p>Certain areas of our websites may be password protected. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone.</p>
<p>Payments made via our websites are processed in a secure environment using software provided by third party providers.</p>
<h2>Third party websites and apps</h2>
<p>Our websites may contain links to and from third party websites and we may provide you with details of apps provided by third parties. Please note that if you follow a link to any of these websites or download an app, these websites and apps will have their own terms of use and privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility of liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites or apps.</p>
<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>You have the following rights with respect to the personal information that we hold about you:</p>
<h3>Your right to access the information we hold about you</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us whether or not we process your personal data and to request information on the purposes of data processing as well as confirmation on whether we use your personal information for these purposes only.</p>
<p>You can request access to the information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact details set out below. We will endeavour to make our file of your information available to you within 1 month, although occasionally we may not be able to give you access to the personal information we hold about you (for example, we may not be able to give you access if it would unreasonably affect someone else's privacy or if giving you access poses a serious threat to someone's life, health or safety).</p>
<p>You also have the right to be informed of the third parties to which we transfer your personal data within the scope of this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Your right to have your information corrected or deleted</h3>
<p>If you have an account with us, you can sign into that account to update your personal information. If you have problems updating the information on your account or if you would like us to delete your information, or if you would like us to ask the third parties to whom we transfer your data within the scope of this privacy policy to update or delete your information, please send your request to <a href="mailto:dpo@ubm.com">dpo@ubm.com</a>&nbsp;and we will action it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Your right to object to us processing your data</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask us to stop processing your data, even where that processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, where the processing is necessary for the legitimate commercial objectives we pursue in the course of our business), including the profiling we undertake to send you personalised offers, product recommendations and similar content. You also have the right to object to any results of a processing activity that prejudice your rights and that are conducted exclusively through automated systems.</p>
<p>You also have the right to ask us to stop processing your data for direct marketing purposes, including any profiling we undertake for the purposes of direct marketing. We will in any case only send you marketing communications if you have previously agreed to this, but if you change your mind you can easily unsubscribe from our marketing communications at any time by following the instructions included in these marketing communications.</p>
<p>Please note that, if you have consented to receive offers from our partners, our partners are responsible for taking account of your rights, including your right to opt-out of receiving offers from them. You may, however, at any time opt-out of receiving offers from third parties by logging in to your user account and changing the settings. If you had previously opted in, your personal data will cease to be transmitted to our partners from the time your request is processed.</p>
<h3>Your right to have your data transmitted to another organisation</h3>
<p>Where we hold personal information about you with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, you also have the right to ask us to provide you with the personal information we hold about you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and, where technically feasible, to transmit that data to another organisation.</p>
<h3>Making a complaint</h3>
<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authorities if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws. You also have a right to claim damages if processing of your personal information violates applicable data protection law.</p>
<h2>Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at our sole discretion, without prior notice to you. We will notify you of any such changes (including when they will take effect). Your continued use of our services or our websites following the posting of changes to these terms means that you consent to those changes.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can email us at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:dpo@ubm.com">dpo@ubm.com</a>. If you wish to exercise your rights under applicable data protection law and this privacy policy, please contact us in writing at:</p>
