					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		
					<h3>1	For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is The Route Development Group Limited of113-115 Portland Street, Manchester, M1 6DW, United Kingdom.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>2	Our nominated representative for the purpose of the Act is Rosalind Callander.</p>
<p>3	Information we may collect from you</p>
<p>3.1 We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<p>3.1.1 Information that you provide by filling in forms on the Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use the Website, subscribing to one or more of our services, posting material or requesting further services. &nbsp;We may also ask you for information, when you enter a competition or promotion, and when you report a problem with the Website.</p>
<p>3.1.2 If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
<p>3.1.3 We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
<p>3.1.4 Details of your visits to the Website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</p>
<p>4	IP addresses and cookies</p>
<p>4.1	We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. &nbsp;This is anonymous statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<p>4.2	For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. &nbsp;Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. &nbsp;They help us to improve the Website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:</p>
<p>4.2.1	To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>
<p>4.2.2	To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise the Website according to your individual interests.</p>
<p>4.2.3	To speed up your searches.</p>
<p>4.2.4	To recognise you when you return to the Website.</p>
<p>4.3 You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. &nbsp;However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website. &nbsp;Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Website.</p>
<p>4.4 Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
<p>5 Where we store your personal data</p>
<p>5.1	The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). &nbsp;It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. &nbsp;By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. &nbsp;We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>5.2 All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Webite, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>5.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p>6 Uses made of the information</p>
<p>6.1 We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
<p>6.1.1	To ensure that content from the Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</p>
<p>6.1.2	To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</p>
<p>6.1.3	To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</p>
<p>6.1.4	To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</p>

<p>6.3	If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (including but not limited to email) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.</p>
<p>6.4	If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means (including but not limited to email) only if you have consented to this.</p>
<p>6.5	If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box situated on the form or forms on which we collect your personal data.</p>

We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in based in the UK). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
<p>7	Disclosure of your information</p>

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>8	Your rights</p>
<p>8.1	You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the form(s) we use to collect your data.&nbsp; You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:james.bland@routesonline.com">james.bland@routesonline.com</a></p>
<p>8.2	The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.&nbsp; If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.&nbsp; Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<p>9	Access to information</p>
<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request will be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
