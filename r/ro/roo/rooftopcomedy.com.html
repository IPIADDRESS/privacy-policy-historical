    <h4>Rooftop Media, Inc. Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>This Privacy Statement sets forth Rooftop Media, Inc.'s (Rooftop) policies regarding the collection and use of information relating to Rooftop's web site located at https://www.rooftopcomedy.com (Site). Certain areas of our Site are only accessible by registered users (each an Authorized User or you), however, our Site is generally accessible by all others who may visit from time to time (Visitors or you). By checking "I Agree" or by using the Site after having been afforded an opportunity to review the following Privacy Statement, you are indicating that you agree to follow and be bound by the Privacy Statement, as may be modified from time to time.</p>

<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>

<h5>General</h5>
<p>Visitors and Authorized Users understand and agree that Rooftop may collect, maintain, and process information provided by such parties to Rooftop, and information collected by Rooftop concerning such Visitors and Authorized Users, on and through the Site or through other interactions with such parties. Visitors and Authorized Users represent and warrant that all information they provide to Rooftop is true, accurate, current, non-misleading, and consistent and relevant for the purpose for which such information is provided. Authorized Users also represent and warrant that they have the authority to provide the information submitted to and through the Site, and understand and agree that Rooftop may from time to time verify such authority.</p>

<h5>Public Areas of the Site</h5>
<p>Visitors may visit the public (non-password protected) areas of the Site without disclosing any personally identifiable information about themselves. However, Visitors may have the opportunity to request information from Rooftop, in which case an e-mail, telephone number or other information may be required in order to allow Rooftop to comply with the request, and for other purposes as may be disclosed at the time the request is made. Visitors may elect to opt-out from receiving communications other than those relating to a specific query or that are necessary for operation of the Site by (a) following the instructions in Opt-Out Choices (below), (b) checking appropriate opt-in or opt-out boxes which may be provided on the collection form, or (c) as set forth in the communication sent from Rooftop, such as a follow-up email. Rooftop will not request more information than is reasonably necessary to provide you with the requested information or services.</p>

<h5>Application Use and/or Access to Password Protected Areas</h5>

<h6>Registration Information</h6>
<p>In order to participate in the password-protected areas of the Site, or utilize certain of the Rooftop services (Rooftop Services), an Authorized User must obtain a password pursuant to our licensing and registration procedures (Password). Required registration information includes e-mail address among other things (Registration Information). Rooftop may use Registration Information to communicate with Authorized Users regarding available transactions, changes in the Site and/or Rooftop Service functionality, features, billing and other activities relating to the operation of the Site and/or Rooftop Service.</p>

<p>Rooftop may also use Registration Information to send Authorized Users information about products or services made available by Rooftop's partners, which may be sent by Rooftop or the Rooftop partner making the offer.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to request that Rooftop not send future communications (except for communications necessary for the operation of the Site and/or Rooftop Service) or that Rooftop not share Registration Information with third parties, are set forth in Opt-Out Choices below.</p>

<h6>Usage Data</h6>
<p>Rooftop may record and collect information about how Visitors and Authorized Users use the Site, and in the case of Authorized Users, the Rooftop Service. This data may include a Visitor's or Authorized User's domain name, language, type of browser and operating system, Internet Service Provider, Internet protocol (IP) address, the Site from which Visitors or Authorized Users arrived at the Site or the amount of time spent on the Site or using the Rooftop Service (collectively, Usage Data). Rooftop may monitor and use Usage Data in aggregated form to measure the Site's performance and Rooftop Service activity and improve the Site's or Rooftop Service's design and functionality. Rooftop may also use Usage Data in aggregated form to develop and distribute to third parties statistical and general information about how the Site and Rooftop Service are used and for other marketing purposes. Rooftop may also use Usage Data in non-aggregated form to investigate and prosecute security violations or to identify a particular Authorized User who engaged in a particular transaction.</p>

<h6>Cookies</h6>
<p>Rooftop may use "cookies" to make transactions and other activities through the Site and the Rooftop Service more convenient and efficient for Visitors and Authorized Users. For these purposes, Rooftop may use "session cookies," which consist of information stored in a browser's memory and passed back to the applicable server whenever a request for a new page on the Site or the Rooftop Service is made. The session cookie is never saved nor written to disk, and the information contained in the session cookie is only valid for that one particular session. The session cookie is discarded when the browser is closed or, in the case of an Authorized User, upon logging out of the Rooftop Service. Most web browsers automatically accept session cookies, and most may also be configured to provide notice of when a session cookie is about to be placed on the browser. No information is saved in such session cookies other than an identification number associated with the particular session.</p>

<h6>Forums</h6>
<p>The Site and/or Rooftop Service may contain forums, chat rooms, and the like (collectively, Forums). Use of any Forum is subject to Rooftop's Terms of Use and any other notice or policy applicable to a particular Forum or all Forums collectively. Any and all information posted on or through a Forum will be generally accessible for viewing by other Forum participants. Accordingly, participants are encouraged to exercise discretion when using Forums.</p>

<h4>Opt-Out Choices</h4>
<p>To "opt-out" of (1) receiving communications from Rooftop (except for communications necessary for the operation of the Site or the Rooftop Service), (2) having contact information disclosed to third parties (except as necessary for Rooftop to operate the Site and Rooftop Service, or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Statement or required under applicable law), or (3) any other consent previously granted for a specific purpose concerning your personally identifiable information, send an e-mail to Rooftop at <a href="mailto:members@rooftopcomedy.com" title="email Members at Rooftop Comedy">members@rooftopcomedy.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Reviewing or Changing Information</h4>
<p>Requests to review or change information previously provided on or through the Site or the Rooftop Service may be made to Rooftop by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:members@rooftopcomedy.com" title="email Members at Rooftop Comedy">members@rooftopcomedy.com</a>. Requests for changes to the Registration Information should be made by Authorized Users directly, or may be made by visiting the members area of the Site.</p>

<h4>Linked Third Party web sites</h4>
<p>Rooftop may provide links to third parties' web sites (Linked Sites) from the Site. Linked Sites are not reviewed, controlled or examined by Rooftop in any way and Rooftop is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any such Linked Sites, or any additional links contained therein. These links do not imply Rooftop's endorsement of or association with the Linked Sites. You should refer to the policies posted by such Linked Sites regarding data collection, privacy and other topics before you use them.</p>

<h4>Disclosures</h4>

<h5>Applicable Law</h5>
<p>Rooftop may make information concerning Visitors, Authorized Users, the Site and the Rooftop Service, and the uses thereof, available to law enforcement personnel and agencies as required by law. Where permitted by law, Rooftop may also disclose such information to law enforcement personnel and agencies, or use such information as part of legal process, in order to protect its property or in furtherance of an investigation regarding a breach of the Site or Rooftop Service rules and policies, or any unauthorized access to or use of the Site or the Rooftop Service, or any illegal activities concerning a particular Visitor or Authorized User.</p>

<h5>Service Providers</h5>
<p>Rooftop may utilize third parties to provide or perform certain services and functions on the Site and/or relating to the Rooftop Service. For example, Rooftop may use third parties to directly provide certain functionality provided on the Site or in the Rooftop Service, or to perform fulfillment or resale services. Rooftop may also transfer financial information and other personally identifiable information as part of its billing procedures, including the Registration Information. Rooftop will make information concerning Visitors and Authorized Users and their use of the Site and Rooftop Service available to these service providers and other affiliates as necessary (including as may be applicable for them to perform their functions), including the Registration Information and Usage Data. Any access to such information will be limited to the purpose for which such information was provided to the service provider. The service providers may be located throughout the world. Accordingly, information relating to Visitors and Authorized Users may be sent worldwide to countries which have a different level of privacy protection than the US or a Visitor's or Authorized User's country of residence.</p>

<h4>Consent to Processing</h4>
<p>By using or providing information to the Site and the Rooftop Service, Authorized Users, Visitors and any other individuals submitting information to Rooftop, understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, processing and use of such information in the United States and other countries and territories, for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Statement. For further certainty, any consent relating to a right to transfer information referred to in the foregoing shall be deemed to include the consent of Authorized Users to the transfer of the applicable personally identifiable information to a jurisdiction which may have a different level of privacy protection than that applicable in the Authorized User's country.</p>

<h4>Transfer of Information</h4>
<p>In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, or sale or transfer of the substantial assets of Rooftop, Registration Information and/or Usage Data collected about Visitors and Authorized Users may be sold, assigned, or transferred to a party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of Rooftop in order to permit such party to continue the operation of the Site or the Rooftop Service.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Rooftop takes seriously the security of the information it collects. Rooftop has therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the level of the data concerned.</p>

<h4>Updates to Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>Rooftop may, in its sole discretion, update this Privacy Statement at any time and from time to time, by posting the amended Privacy Statement on the Site and the Rooftop Service. With respect to Visitors to the Site, the amended Privacy Statement shall be effective upon posting, and any access to or use of the Site by such Visitors following such update shall be deemed consent to such update. With respect to Authorized Users of the Rooftop Service, amendments to this Privacy Statement shall be effective fifteen (15) days following such posting. The foregoing notwithstanding, Visitors and Authorized Users are encouraged to refer back to this page regularly. This Privacy Statement may not be otherwise amended without the written consent of Rooftop.</p>

<h4>Children</h4>
<p>Our Site and the Rooftop Services are not generally intended for use by children under the age of 18, and Rooftop does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children in this age group. If we become aware that a user under the age of 18 has registered or is attempting to register, we will notify the user that he or she is not eligible for registration. We will then expunge any personally identifiable information from our records.</p>
