Personal information is information about you, not otherwise publicly available, that personally identifies you; personal information may include your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information. 
</p><p>&nbsp;ROOZVIDEO.COM has established registration and sign-in procedures which, in conjunction with this Privacy Policy, help ensure the privacy of information provided to ROOZVIDEO.COM by its visitors and members while using ROOZVIDEO.COM websites.

</p><p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHO IS COLLECTING IT</b><br><br>
When you register to become a Member of a ROOZVIDEO.COM website, ROOZVIDEO.COM collects certain information such as your e-mail address, your country of location, as well as information about each Member's use of ROOZVIDEO.COM features and contributions of content (collectively, "Membership Information").
