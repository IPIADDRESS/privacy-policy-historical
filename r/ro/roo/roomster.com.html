These Service Providers will only have access to the information needed to perform these limited functions on our behalf.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Other Members of the Service.</em></strong> If you are a registered member of the Service, the information you provide as part of your member profile, including your first name, photo, age, gender, city, state and occupation, will be accessible to and viewable by both unregistered users of the Service and registered members of the Service. All other information you provide as part of your profile will only be accessible to and viewable by registered members of the Service. We note that, if you have a paid subscription to use the Service, your payment information, subscription information and private mailbox will never be accessible or viewable by any other users or members of the Service.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Third Party Networks.</em></strong> If you post a listing for an Accommodation through the Service, this listing information may be shared through third party websites that we have relationships with. For example, if you post a listing for an Accommodation on the Service, the listing for that Accommodation may also appear on third party websites, such as trulia.com or zillow.com, that feature rental or leasing opportunities. By listing an Accommodation on the Service, you are consenting to have the listing for that Accommodation appear on these third party websites.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Response to Subpoenas or Court Orders or to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies.</em></strong> To the extent permitted by law, we will disclose your information to government authorities or third parties if: (i) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order; (ii) we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect the property or other rights of us or other users, third parties or the public at large; or (iii) we believe that you have abused the Service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws. You should be aware that, following disclosure to any third party, your information may be accessible by others to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Business Transfers; Bankruptcy.</em></strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your information and other information we have collected from users of the Service to third parties. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this type of transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Aggregate Information.</em></strong> We may share information relating to users of the Service with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties on an anonymous, aggregate basis. While this information will not identify you personally, in some instances these third parties may be able to combine this aggregate information with other data they have about you, or that they receive from third parties, in a manner that allows them to identify you personally.                                    </li>                <li>                    <strong><em>Our Affiliates.</em></strong> We may share some or all of your information with our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, joint venturers, or other companies under common control with us. We will require these entities to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to their use of your information.                                    </li>            </ol>                                                </li>    <li>        <strong>Children Under Age 13.</strong> The Service is not intended for children under age 13, or for anyone under age 18 or the applicable age of majority without involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect or distribute personal information from or about children under the age of 13.            </li>    <li>        <strong>Security.</strong> We implement reasonable security measures intended to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Roomster cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Service and you do so at your own risk.            </li>    <li>        <strong>Amendments to this Privacy Policy.</strong> We will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the amended terms on the Service at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue your use of the Service prior to the time the modified privacy policy takes effect. If you continue using the Service after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy policy.            </li>    <li>        <strong>Use of Information Outside Your Country of Residence.</strong> The Service is directed to users located in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and you choose to use the Service or provide your information to us, your information may be transferred to, processed and maintained on servers or databases located in the United States. Your agreement to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of information through the Service represents your consent and agreement to these practices.
