	 <p class="update-notice">
      (last updated April 2008)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "You" or "Your" shall mean the person or entity
      accessing this site (the "Site") and using the services
      available on it (the "Services").
    </p>
    <p>
      "We", "Us" or "Our" shall mean (1) the
      licensed real estate broker ("Broker") indentified above that is
      the owner and operator of the Site, (2) Roost, Inc. ("Roost"),
      which is providing web site design, hosting and technology services to the
      Broker pursuant to an agreement between Roost and the Broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes the types of information We gather from
      users of this Site and how that information is used. Please read this
      policy carefully before You provide Us with any personal information. If
      You have questions about this policy, please email Us at
      <a href="mailto:privacy@roost.com">privacy@roost.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Information We Collect</strong>
      <br>
      We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with Our server,
      administer Our website and track usage statistics. Your IP address may
      vary each time You visit or it may be the same. It would be extremely
      difficult for Us to identify You through Your IP address, and We make no
      attempt to do so. If You reached Our site by clicking on a link or
      advertisement on another site, then We also log that information. This
      helps Us maximize our Internet exposure and understand Our users'
      interests. All of this information is collected and used only in the
      aggregate; that is, it is entered into Our database where We can use it to
      generate overall reports on Our visitors, but not individual reports that
      identify You personally.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      We also place a small text file known as a "cookie" on Your
      computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows Us to
      track Your path through Our website and to determine whether You have
      visited Us before. However, unless You register with Us, it contains no
      personally identifiable information that would allow Us to identify You.
      Cookies cannot be used to read data off of Your hard drive and cannot
      retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. We
      use cookies in this manner to help Us understand how visitors use Our site
      and to help Us to improve Our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from
      Us by following the procedures specific to Your Web browser. Although You
      may do so, You may find that Your browser reacts strangely when visiting
      Our website and other websites linked through Us. Since cookies do not
      provide Us with any information from which We can identify You, We suggest
      You allow Us to place a cookie on Your computer. We may use Web beacons on
      Our site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on Our
      site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate
      purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small,
      graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message
      that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who
      is visiting a site. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because
      they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as
      the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. Web beacons
      are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page. Users can click on
      "view profiles" of the Web page to see whether the page is using
      a Web beacon. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer to which
      the Web beacon is sent, the URL of the page from which the Web beacon
      comes, and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to
      personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web bugs to
      add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting
      and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another
      use of Web bugs is to provide an independent accounting of how many people
      have visited a particular website. Web bugs are also used to gather
      statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      We also give You the option to give us Your email address and other
      personal information so We can send You relevant residential real estate
      news and information.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong>
      We use the information We collect to help You:
    </p><ol>
      <li>
        find the most relevant information by organizing the website optimally
      </li>
      <li>
        find relevant residential real estate-related news and information via
        email (if You have registered Your email address
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    
    <p>
      You can control whether You receive such emails by following the
      instructions at the end of each email we send. You may also opt-out by
      sending an email to
      <a href="mailto:privacy@roost.com">privacy@roost.com</a>. We may also use
      the information You provide to allow Us to contact You for administrative
      purposes; for example, to tell You about changes to Our privacy policy. We
      may also use certain information that You provide in order to present You
      with advertising that You may find interesting. This benefits both of Us.
      It benefits Us because advertising helps pay the bills, and We can charge
      Our advertisers more if they know that their ads will be seen by somebody
      more likely to find them useful. It benefits You because You see
      advertising that may actually be interesting to You, rather than annoying.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      <strong>Disclosure of Information</strong>
   
      We do not rent or sell personal information about You to third parties,
      except: (1) with Your express consent, (2) as necessary to complete a
      transaction You have requested, (3) for marketing purposes (unless You
      have chosen not to receive such communications, in certain business
      transactions), (4) when required by law, or (5) when necessary to protect
      Our rights or property. We reserve the right to use in any manner and
      disclose any non-personal information that We collect including cookie and
      traffic data. We do not combine personal information with any of the
      non-personal information gathered on Our site.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      We may release personal information when We believe release is appropriate
      to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order);
      to enforce or apply Our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect
      for amounts owed to Us; to protect Our rights or property, or to protect
      any of Our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, Our Site or
      Services; or if We reasonably believe that an emergency involving
      immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person
      requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use third party service providers to assist Us with the
      administration of the site or otherwise perform services on Our behalf,
      including transaction processing and sending email. Such third parties may
      be supplied with or have access to Your personal information solely to
      provide services to Us or on our behalf. We may use third parties, called
      third-party ad servers or ad networks, to deliver ads to You on Our
      behalf. These third-party ad servers may collect and use non-personally
      identifiable information about Your visits to our Site in order to present
      advertisements that may be of interest to You. If You would like more
      information about this practice or to opt out of having this information
      used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit
      <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Information about Our users and the Site is Our business asset. Therefore,
      information about Our users, including personal information, will be
      disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate
      business to provide the site, our services or fulfill products, sale or
      pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency,
      bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be
      transferred as one of Our business assets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Security</strong>
  
      We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the
      loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Our control.
      However, We cannot guarantee the protection of information against
      interception, misappropriation, misuse, or alteration or that Your
      information may be not be disclosed or accessed by accidental
      circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. You should be aware
      that We have no control over the security of other sites on the Internet
      You might visit, interact with, or from which You buy products or
      services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Policy Changes</strong>
  
      We reserve the right to change this policy when We deem it advisable to do
      so. If We make significant changes that affect the use or disclosure of
      Your personal information, We will make reasonable efforts to notify You
      of the changes and to give You the opportunity to cancel Your
      registration.
