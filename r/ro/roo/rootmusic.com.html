	<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	<p>Here at the RootMusic, Inc. (“RootMusic”), we understand and respect your concerns about the use of your personal information. We believe that you should know what information about you we collect, as well as how that information is used, maintained, and, in some cases, shared. The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies.</p>
	<p>We will collect information about you when you register to post messages on one of our discussion forums, when you register to use BandPage or BandPage Plus, when you transmit information to us via our website or by email, when you participate in one of our promotions, and when you otherwise use this website. By doing any of the foregoing, you assent to this privacy policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not engage in any of these activities.</p>
	<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND OUR USE OF SUCH INFORMATION</h3>
	<p>The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:</p>
	<h4>Contact Information</h4>
	<p>In general, you may visit our website without revealing any personal information other than technology-related information described in the section below.  However, certain sections and features of our website are only available to registered users of our website, who must enter a unique user ID and password.  We collect and store personal information related to each user ID when you register for an account and use our website.  We also collect and store any personal information and other data you have provided to us via our website, by email, or otherwise.  Specifically, we collect and store in a database your name, mailing address, and email address, and may also collect and store your phone number, date of birth and other information you may provide to us.</p>
	<p>We use this information to respond to any inquiries you may submit to us, to track and monitor usage of our website and to communicate with you about your account and your use of our website.  In addition, we may use this information to send you periodic publications associated with RootMusic, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications via email. We also use this information to operate this website; in particular, to facilitate postings on our discussion forums.  We also use this information for targeted advertising and other marketing purposes.</p>
	<h4>Website Information</h4>
	<p>Our website collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the website.  This aggregate information is collected site-wide, and includes anonymous website statistics. Our website also employs browser cookies to store users’ preferences and record session information.  “Cookies” are bits of information that are stored by your browser on your hard drive.  This technology allows for the storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable, and remembers you when you take action on our website.  You can turn off the “cookie” function through most standard browsers; however, the majority of the features on our website may not function properly, including but not limited to, the login function, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>  
	<p>In addition, when you visit our website our system automatically collects information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request and the unique identity of your browser.  This information is used to analyze trends, administer the website, improve the design of our website, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide. </p>
	<h4>Credit Card Information</h4>
	<p>For users that purchase our BandPage Plus services, we collect credit card information.  Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but we do not store any credit card numbers in any way.</p>
	<h4>Information from Promotions</h4>
	<p>We collect information you give us when you participate in a RootMusic promotion, such as sweepstakes or contest.  Specifically, you will typically be asked to provide your name, email address, and mailing address.</p>
	<p>We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion.  We may also use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.</p>
	<h4>Other Information</h4>
	<p>We may retain any data you provide to us in an email or other inquiry, to track the types of questions we receive, analyze trends, administer the websites and services we offer, improve the design of our websites and services we offer, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.</p>
	<h3>WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED</h3>
	<p>We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.  We reserve the right to disclose information about you, including data on which pages you have visited, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, website, business, users or others.</p>
	<p>In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. RootMusic does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.</p>
	<h3>OPT OUT</h3>
	<p>As noted, once you register with RootMusic, we may send you administrative-related emails, as well as emails to facilitate your access to RootMusic’s services, including providing you with related updates.  We may not offer you the opportunity to opt out of receiving these communications.</p>
	<p>However, we provide you with the opportunity to elect not to receive other types of communications, including emails informing you about RootMusic’s services and other offerings that we think will interest you.  If you want to stop receiving these communications, click on the “Unsubscribe” link in any such email, or contact use via email at support@rootmusic.com.</p>
	<h3>SECURITY</h3>
	<p>Whenever RootMusic handles information that you disclose on our website, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.  RootMusic uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  Certain information transmitted through our website, such as Cookies, login information (with the exception of the Forum login) and information relating to the purchase of our services, is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology or similar encryption technology.  Unfortunately, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems but we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.</p>  	
	<h3>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h3>
	<p>Although our website may be accessed by children under the age of 13, we will not knowingly collect, maintain or use any personal information from such children, and no part of RootMusic’s services are directed to persons under the age of 13.  In fact, you must be at least 13 years of age to set up an account with us.  IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS ROOTMUSIC’S SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</p>
	<p>If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, we will promptly delete such information from our databases.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a RootMusic account, then you may alert RootMusic at support@rootmusic.com and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.</p>
	<h3>OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
	<p>For your convenience, this website may contain links to other websites, or you may be otherwise referred to other websites. This privacy policy does not apply to these linked websites. Each website should be checked for its own privacy policy.</p> 
	<h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
	<p>RootMusic may from time to time update this privacy policy. In the event that RootMusic merges with, or is acquired by another company, a change to this privacy policy may result. Whenever a change to this policy is significant, we will place a prominent notice on this website.</p> 
	<h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>
	<p>Our website is controlled by RootMusic from our offices within the State of California, United States of America.  By choosing to visit this website or otherwise provide information to RootMusic, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this privacy policy will be governed by the law of the State of California.  If you are accessing our website from any region with regulations or laws governing personal data collection, use or disclosure that differ from United States laws or regulations, please note that through your continued use of our website, which is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, this privacy policy and our Terms of Use (available  <a href="/terms">here</a> and/or at http://www.rootmusic.com/terms ), you are transferring personal information to the United States of America and you consent to that transfer.  You also consent to the adjudication of any disputes arising in connection with our website in the federal and state courts of San Francisco County in the State of California.  You also agree to arbitrate such disputes and to abide by any limitation on damages contained in our Terms of Use or other agreement we have with you.</p>
