                        Ancestry.com Operations Inc., (and referred to as 'Ancestry.com' 'Ancestry'
                        'we' 'us' 'our'), owner and operator of RootsWeb.com, recognizes the
                        confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in
                        registering or making purchases from our website and we are firmly committed
                        to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information
                        gathering and dissemination practices for this site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Overview:</b><br>
                        The personal, private information that is provided to RootsWeb.com by
                        individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in
                        rare cases involving possible violations of our use policies or legal
                        statutes. We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent,
                        that is used to fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better
                        meet the needs of our users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Information submitted by you online (such as products you purchase from a
                        Ancestry network site, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared
                        with companies with which RootsWeb.com has a commerce relationship and
                        through which you reached this site, for marketing purposes. In such
                        circumstances you will be considered their customer as well. If you object
                        to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. Under no circumstances will
                        RootsWeb.com share with any other party your password or other personal
                        information it may acquire about children, family, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used
                        in aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to
                        the following Frequently Asked Questions:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Does RootsWeb.com ask for personal information?</b><br>
                        In some cases, personal information is required to use RootsWeb.com
                        features. In these cases, RootsWeb.com asks for your name, e-mail
                        address, and other limited personal information when you register and
                        use features such as the message boards, and make purchases at the
                        Ancestry.com online store. Most of this information may be entered at your
                        discretion. We may ask for similar information at other times, such as
                        when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by RootsWeb.com
                        and/or our many partners.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>How Does RootsWeb.com use my personal information?</b><br>
                        Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant,
                        user-friendly Web experience possible. The primary use of all your
                        personal information is to efficiently provide you with relevant information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        RootsWeb.com will also use registration information to let you know about
                        new features or other offers of interest from RootsWeb.com, or to address
                        customer service needs and requests.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser never has
                        access to individual account information. RootsWeb.com does not sell, rent,
                        or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these
                        advertisers. Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the
                        advertising message and RootsWeb.com then displays the ad to appropriate
                        users based on the criteria specified in the order.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Will RootsWeb.com disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
                        RootsWeb.com will not disclose any of your personal information, except with
                        your knowledge and consent as described in this policy or as may be required
                        by law, or to protect the rights or property of RootsWeb.com.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are
                        specifically described when the data is collected such as in the rules of
                        sweepstakes or other promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any,
                        information you disclose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We do reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45
                        percent of our users are female" or "10,000 members indicate an interest in
                        gardening" in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
                        advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of confidentiality
                        agreements, we use third party processors in some cases to help us provide
                        services and manage our sites and relationships with you. These may include
                        purchase and order fulfillment, credit card processing, removing duplicate
                        information from lists, providing marketing assistance and providing other
                        customer services. Third-party processors and providers will be given access
                        only to that information needed to perform their support functions, and are
                        prohibited from using it for other purposes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, if you click away from RootsWeb.com to visit the site of any
                        third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or
                        other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services
                        offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection
                        practices. RootsWeb.com has no responsibility or liability for these
                        independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies
                        carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As our business continues to grow, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or
                        business units. In these transactions, customer information is often one of
                        the transferred assets, remaining subject to promises made in existing
                        privacy statements. Also, in the event that Ancestry, or substantially all
                        of its assets are acquired, customer information will as a matter of course
                        be one of the transferred assets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Will RootsWeb.com use my information for direct mailings?</b><br>
                        RootsWeb.com will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing
                        you of changes or additions to RootsWeb.com, or of any RootsWeb.com related
                        products and services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may
                        opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>May I refuse to provide personal information to RootsWeb.com or to accept advertising?</b><br>
                        Visitors may access RootsWeb.com services without providing any personal
                        information. To gain full access to certain features, a username, e-mail
                        address and appropriate personal information are required. Because the
                        RootsWeb.com website is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn
                        off" the advertising that appears on RootsWeb.com pages, but you may opt to
                        be excluded from any e-mail advertising.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Does RootsWeb.com use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</b></p>

                    <p>
                        <b>IP Addresses:</b><br>
                        We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to
                        administer our website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad
                        demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>RootsWeb.com Cookies:</b><br>
                        Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal
                        information from your computer's memory, but rather, record only information
                        you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny
                        files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our
                        website that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each
                        time you return. RootsWeb.com may make limited use of cookies to deliver
                        content specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain
                        your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket,"
                        or save your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you
                        login.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Advertiser Cookies:</b><br>
                        We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf.
                        These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single
                        pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any
                        information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags
                        is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this

                        <b>Member Profiles</b><br>
                        Demographic data is collected at our site at the users' option. This
                        information may include age and gender and other personal preferences that
                        can be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing RootsWeb.com to
                        advertisers and others. In no case is personal information given or sold
                        to third parties. RootsWeb.com controls the distribution of ALL information
                        at the site.

                        <b>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>
                        RootsWeb.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on
                        our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like
                        an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or
                        income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our
                        company or our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to
                        contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies
                        for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the
                        terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any
                        time, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply
                        decline to take part in the promotions.
