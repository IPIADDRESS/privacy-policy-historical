            <p>
              Our Privacy Policy is an extension of our commitment to provide quality
              services with integrity to our customers. The Policy is designed to assist you
              in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the information you may
              provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using the
              Room Key website (the “Site”). By visiting the Site, you are expressly consent
              to the collection, use, sharing, storage, processing and disclosure of
              information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
            <p>
              When you visit our Site we may store information obtained or provided during
              your web session.  We may also assign you one or more “cookies”. Our Site
              utilizes cookies to collect for, among other things, general Site and web
              usage patterns. Information gathered from cookies may include the date and time
              of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site and the websites that
              you visited before and after your visit to our Site. Our Site’s servers also
              automatically identify your computer by its Internet protocol (“IP”) address,
              which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your
              Internet service provider. Your IP address may be used to address problems with
              our server, administer our Site and/or to gather broad demographic information
              about our users. In addition, the other websites that you visit have IP
              addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their
              pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The majority of browsers accept cookies, but the “Help” menu on your browser
              should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new
              cookies. However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some Site
              functionality may be lost. If you wish to opt-out of the display of targeted
              advertisements, you may do so by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">here</a>
              to visit the Network Advertising Initiative site to set preferences and opt out
              of third-party targeting cookies used by vendors including Google, Turn and
              others.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.
               You will continue to receive generic ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the information we collect using cookies, we also collect
              information, including personally identifiable information, that you actively
              provide directly to us.  For example, through an account created on this Site
              or communications (such as emails) you may send to us.  We may maintain your
              email and the information therein, including your e-mail address and any
              personally identifiable information contained in the e-mail.  Information
              collected in this manner is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the information you provide to us, and what is provided through
              cookies, we may receive, collect or record various types of hardware and
              software information.  Such information can include technical or functional
              information such as interface type, software types and applications,
              communications data and communications details.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any information you provide directly or indirectly to us (other than personally
              identifiable information), whether by direct entry, submission, e-mail, or
              otherwise (including data, questions, comments, or suggestions), will be
              treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the property
              of Hotel JV Services, LLC (the “Company”).  Such information may be used for

              publication, broadcast, commercial dissemination, and posting.  The Company
              shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in
              any communication you send to us for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not
              limited to, developing and marketing services using such information.
            </p>
            <h3>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              The information we collect is used for various business purposes.  For example,
              we may use the information collected to enhance our Site to make it easier,
              faster and more effective to use. In addition, we may use information to
              customize a user’s Site experience to better suit the user’s needs, and to
              develop our services. Additionally, cookies provide us information about how
              many people visit our Site, when they visit and how they use our Site.  We may
              also use the information collected to collaborate with other businesses in
              order to drive relevant content to you.  Information collected may result in
              your viewing of particular advertising tailored to your interests based on your
              activities on our Site and a shopping experience customized to you in content
              and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to provide you with the most recent and compelling information to
              help you qualify your hotel booking decisions. To that end we may email you
              about destinations and/or hotels that may interest you, based on the
              information you have provided — whether directly or indirectly. &nbsp;With each
              email you receive, you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive
              future email correspondence. &nbsp;We also may share similar content with you via
              social media channels, like Facebook, if you have provided us with your social
              media contact information.
            </p>

              You may create an account to become an online member of Room Key at your
              election.  Membership will allow you to save Site preferences, and you will be
              able to provide, update, and change certain of your information online through

              must be protected using no less than commercially reasonable means of
              protection. In order to help us protect the content and information you access
              using your account, you must not disclose your password to anyone and must make

            <h3>WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
              We secure the sensitive information you provide (such as passwords) by using
              reasonable technical efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or
              accidental loss or destruction of information.  Although we use commercially
              reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of user data, transmissions
              made using the internet cannot be made absolutely secure. We have no liability
              for disclosure of user data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts
              of third parties.

          <h3>What are Loyalty Member Rates?</h3>
          <p>Room Key gives you access to low<strong> Loyalty Member Rates</strong>
             for more than 60 of the world’s largest hotel chains all in one place.
            Loyalty Rates are rates typically
            reserved for members of the hotel’s loyalty program available mainly on the
            hotel’s own website. Now Room Key is the only travel site where customers can
            shop and compare Loyalty Rates across so many hotel chains all in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            To book a Loyalty Rate, simply enroll in the hotel’s loyalty program (it’s free)
            and provide your membership number when booking. You’ll instantly qualify for the
            Loyalty Rate and get all of the loyalty member benefits as well. There are no
            hidden fees or paid memberships required.
