In addition, paid users get a double backup of their photos, so we can recover them in case you accidently remove photos, or require a disaster recovery. Double backups are kept for a maximum of 6 months, after which they are removed.

Data cannot be removed from double backups before their 6 month expiration, for technical reasons. In case of a (disaster) recovery from the double backup, we have the necessary procedures in place to make sure that photos from users that were removed or requested to be removed, are not restored from the double backup.</td>
