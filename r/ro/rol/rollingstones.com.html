<strong>SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICY</strong>

<br><br>YOUR PEACE OF MIND<br><br>Universal Music Operations Limited ("Universal") operates this website and respects the security and privacy concerns of users of this and all its websites. We are notified under the Data Protection Act 1998 and comply with the Act in all our dealings with your personal data.

<br><br>By using the website you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. As a general rule, no personal information (i.e. name, address, telephone number, e-mail address) is automatically collected from users of this website. However, there may be circumstances in which users voluntarily supply such information and in this event, any such information will be kept secure and confidential and will be used only for those purposes made known to users at the time the information is collected, or for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We will also add your registered email address and personal details to our database if you register for updates from Universal Music via Facebook Connect. We follow strict security procedures for the storage and disclosure of information you have given us in order to prevent unauthorised access. 



<br><br>Personal information collected via this website is controlled by<br><br>Universal Music Operations Limited, <br><br>364-366 Kensington High Street,<br>London,<br>W14 8NS.

<br><br>OUR USE OF INFORMATION AND PERSONAL DATA<br><br>The information collected is used to provide users with information on the relevant Universal Artist to customise the user's online experience and to improve the content of the website. Other uses of this information include the internal review of the web pages visited, tracking the progress and number of entries in promotions and contests, tracking the number of users of the site and where appropriate, product purchased through the site. Where users have signed up and opted in to receive information and promotions from us, the information may also be used to notify users of future Universal product releases and information on the artist concerned together with news on other Universal artists, related products and services which may be of interest to users. 
<br><br>If at any time you wish to stop receiving information you can opt out or reply to the e-mail address at the bottom of each e-mail you receive from us. You can also opt out of any SMS communications you receive from us. Alternatively you can e-mail us at info@umusic.com and tell us what you would like us to do. As Universal Music is part of a worldwide group of companies, Universal Music may from time to time transfer data from the point of collection to a local Universal Music company located in another jurisdiction (including but not limited to Universal Music group companies located outside of the European Economic Area). Information will only be so transferred in circumstances where it is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or the purposes made known to users at the time information is collected. For example, if a user located in another jurisdiction signs up and opts in to receive information and promotions from us, Universal Music may transfer data to the local Universal Music company located in the user's jurisdiction which may contact the user with relevant information and promotions as described above. Communications may therefore come from local Universal Music companies, be in your local language and promote localised events/promotions. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of those local communications on any email you receive from them. Please note that any transfer of data to a Universal Music group company located outside of the European Economic Area shall be made in accordance with the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal data and authorised by the Information Commissioner. No matter where your information is processed, this privacy policy will remain in effect.

Texts are completely FREE to you with the exception of the initial registration text which will cost your standard network charge.

<br><br>THIRD PARY COOKIES <br><br>

Some of the advertisements you see on this and some artist sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies" to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it. These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users). If you wish to block third party cookies, you can do so in your browser's security settings - indeed, the majority of browsers will block them by default.
