    <u><b><p>What information is collected?</p></b></u>
    <p>Hasbro wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us
    figure out what you like and don't like about our sites, we may ask for your opinion from
    time to time. You may also be asked whether you would like to receive information about
    new Hasbro products. In addition, we sometimes collect information to find out how people
    found the Hasbro site, which pages they visited, and how long they stayed. This
    information does not include any personal information about you. We just need to know this
    stuff so we can keep making this site better and better! </p>
    <p>If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's consent before
    you can provide any personal information to us. Kids, if you are ever unsure about
    anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help. </p>
    <p>Hasbro may in some cases collect demographic information provided by you such as game
    platform, hobbies, game preferences, etc. This information is only requested on a
    voluntary basis. Hasbro may aggregate this demographic information and disclose such
    information in aggregate to third parties. However, in these situations, <b>Hasbro will
    not share any information that could be used to personally identify you.</b></p>
    <p>Specifically, we may collect information for the following circumstances:</p><ul>

      address and e-mail address) contained in your email to respond to your specific inquiry or
      comments in the e-mail. Though we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we will not

    <b><p align="CENTER"><a name="parents">NOTE TO PARENTS</a></p></b> 
    <p>Hasbro has developed its Web site to be an enjoyable experience for children (and
    adults) of all ages. Hasbro recognizes that some younger children may not understand some
    of the information contained on the Web site or how the site operates. That is the purpose
    of the Privacy Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they
    will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to
    provide. Hasbro strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate
    notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the
    site, as well as protecting its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments
    about the Hasbro Web site, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:consumer_support@hasbro.com">consumer_support@hasbro.com</a>. </p>
    <p>It is Hasbro's policy not to collect personally identifiable information from children
    under 13 without first obtaining a parent or guardian's verifiable permission. If a
    visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to print out a
    permission form from the site which must be signed and returned by the visitor's parent or
    guardian before Hasbro will accept information from that visitor. Furthermore, Hasbro will
    not collect personally identifiable information from children over 12 and under 18 without
    notifying a parent or guardian via email. </p>
