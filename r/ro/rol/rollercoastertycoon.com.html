    <p>Welcome to the Hasbro Web site! If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in
    knowing more about Hasbro's policy regarding the online collection of information from
    children, we recommend reviewing the <a href="#parents">Note To Parents</a> below. </p>
    <p><b>WELCOME!</b> </p>
    <p>This Hasbro Web site brings you the coolest information about the world of Hasbro and
    provides a first hand look at some of our games and toys. </p>
    <p>Hasbro wants to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible. To help us
    figure out what you like and don't like about our sites, we may ask for your opinion from
    time to time. You may also be asked whether you would like to receive information about
    new Hasbro products. If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or
    guardian's consent before you can provide this information. </p>
    <p>By allowing you to send email to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal
    information about you. We will only use any personal information (such as name, mailing
    address and e-mail address) contained in your email to respond to your specific inquiry or
    comments in the e-mail.&nbsp; Though we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we
    will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than
    responding to your specific inquiry or comments.&nbsp; If you have registered with our
    site, you may at any time update the contact information we have for you or inform us that
    you do not want to receive new product information from us by contacting us at registration@hasbro.com. <i>Please
    be sure to include in your message the name of the site at which you registered and the
    email address you used to register so that we can verify your request.</i> </p>
    <p>If you are 18 years or older, you may have the ability to email other users or post
    messages on portions of this site. In the event that you do post messages on this site,
    remember that other users of this site will have access to your email address and user
    name. </p>
    <p>We sometimes collect information to find out how people found the Hasbro site, which
    pages they visited, and how long they stayed. This information does not include any
    personal information about you. We just need to know this stuff so we can keep making this
    site better and better! </p>
    <p>Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your
    parent or guardian for help. </p>
    <p>Hasbro may use "cookies" to enhance your experience at our Web site. Cookies
    are pieces of information that we may place on your computer to help
    "personalize" your visit to the site. For example, a cookie will allow us to
    remember certain things about you, such as your screen name or where you left off in a
    game. Most major Web sites use cookies exactly for this purpose. A cookie tells us nothing
    more than what you choose to tell us. We can not tell who you are or where you are. The
    cookie only tells us that you have visited the site before and may contain certain
    information that will help us make your visit more enjoyable. Hasbro will never use
    cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a
    cookie. </p>
    <p>To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an email address
    or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your
    real name for these promotions. For other Hasbro promotions, we may request your name and
    home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. Remember,
    children under 13 years of age will need their parent or guardian's permission before
    providing this information. </p>
    <p>Hasbro will not share any personal information provided by you with any other
    person or company without permission. Hasbro may in the future request information from
    you that may be shared with others. In these situations, you will be told of this fact,
    and given an opportunity to say no. We respect your privacy and your choice not to have
    your personal information shared with other people. </p>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this statement at any time, so visit this page from time
    to time to check for changes. For additional information about our Web site, please see
    our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> of Use. Thanks. Have fun! </p>
    <p align="center"><b><a name="parents">NOTE TO PARENTS</a></b> </p>
    <p>Hasbro has developed its Web site to be an enjoyable experience for children (and
    adults) of all ages. Hasbro recognizes that some younger children may not understand some
    of the information contained on the Web site or how the site operates. That is the purpose
    of the Privacy Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they
    will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to
    provide. Hasbro strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate
    notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the
    site, as well as protecting its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments
    about the Hasbro Web site, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:consumer_support@hasbro.com">consumer_support@hasbro.com</a>. </p>
    <p>It is Hasbro's policy not to collect personally identifiable information from children
    under 13 without first obtaining a parent or guardian's verifiable permission. If a
    visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to print out a
    permission form from the site which must be signed and returned by the visitor's parent or
    guardian before Hasbro will accept information from that visitor. Furthermore, Hasbro will
    not collect personally identifiable information from children over 12 and under 18 without
    notifying a parent or guardian via email. </p>
    <p>Hasbro does not share personally identifiable information gathered from users of the
    Web site with third parties. </p>
