      Rolling Razor, Inc. is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our 
customers and all visitors to our web site. We take this matter very seriously, 
and have instituted many policies and procedures to insure that none of your 
privacy rights as stated herein are ever violated. The following outlines 
Rolling Razors privacy policy and details the measures we have taken to 
safeguard and protect your privacy, while providing you with a unique and 
rewarding online shopping experience. By visiting Rolling Razor, you are 
agreeing to the policies detailed below. <p></p> 
<p></p><div class="question">Electronically emailing Rolling Razor </div> 
When you send an email to Rolling Razor or visit the web site, you are 
communicating with us electronically. When you send an email to Rolling Razor, 
you consent to receive communications from us electronically in response. Please 
note that this does not constitute opting in to our email or direct mail lists. 
Rolling Razor may communicate with you by email, by updating or posting notices 
on the web site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosure and other 
communications that Rolling Razor provides to you electronically satisfy any 
legal requirement that such communication be in writing. All communications with 
Rolling Razor become the property of Rolling Razor. <p></p> 
<p></p><div class="question">What information does Rolling Razor collect?</div>  
In order to serve you better, Rolling Razor collects and stores your personal 
information when you: (i) create an account on Rolling Razor; (ii) sign up to be 
notified of special deals like discounts and exclusive offers; or (iii) enter a 
contest or promotion on our site. An account is created when you do one of 
following things: make a purchase on Rolling Razor, or register for an account 
on Rolling Razor, or enter certain Rolling Razor contest. When creating an 
account, we ask you for your first and last name, your e-mail address, a 
password, and perhaps some other similar information. If you are making a 
purchase, we will additionally ask you for your billing address, shipping 
address, and credit card information. <p></p> 
<p>Our system also may gather information about the areas you visit on our site 
as well as the IP address you use to connect to our site. We may use this data 
internally only for 2 reasons: 1) to personalize your experience on Rolling 
Razor.com and the marketing materials you receive from Rolling Razor or its 
partners and 2) to prevent fraud on your account. We would not share any of this 
data on an individual basis (we may share it in an aggregate form without 
personal identifiers) with any outside company other than perhaps consultants or 
service providers of Rolling Razor who were assisting Rolling Razor in serving 
you better. Of course, to the extent that we would ever share any of that 
information with a consultant or service provider, we would only do so if that 
party agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy policy at 
least as stringent as our own. We do use navigational information both in the 
aggregate and on an individual basis to understand how our visitors use Rolling 
Razor so that we can make our site better. We do not keep track of where you go 
on the World Wide Web. </p> 
<p></p><div class="question">What does Rolling Razor do with this personal 
information? </div> 
Your information is used to process your orders and personalize your shopping 
experience on Rolling Razor, for internal purposes and to comply with any legal 
requirements. By storing your personal information on a secure server, Rolling 
Razor is able to shorten your checkout process and allow you to check your order 
status online. <p></p> 
<p>At Rolling Razor, we also review what kinds of products appeal most to our 
customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offering 
in the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells 
best. We may also use information about the kinds of products you buy from 
Rolling Razor to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have 
the option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to 
opt-out, please see below). To the extent that you use electronic wallet 
technology provided by a portal, such as AOL's Quick Checkout feature or MSN's 
.NET Passport technology, or another service provider, we may share some of your 
purchase information with that portal or service provider to assist that portal 
in serving you better. However, rest assured that we would only share that 
information with the same portal you are using and then only to the extent that 
such portal agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy 
policy at least as stringent as our own. </p> 
<p></p><div class="question">Does Rolling Razor share any information it collects 
with outside parties?</div>  
We may use your purchase information about the products you buy from Rolling 
Razor to make other marketing offers to you. Of course, you always have the 
option to opt-out from receiving such offers (for instructions on how to 
opt-out, please see below). We may share this information with consultants or 
service providers to help Rolling Razor serve you better. Of course, to the 
extent that we would ever share any of that information with a consultant or 
service provider, we would only do so if that party agreed to protect your 
private information by adopting a privacy policy at least as stringent as our 
own. To the extent that you use electronic wallet technology provided by a 
portal, such as AOL's Quick Checkout feature or MSN's .NET Passport technology, 
we may share some of your purchase information with that portal to assist that 
portal in serving you better. However, rest assured that we would only share 
that information with the portal you are using and then only to the extent that 
such portal agreed to protect your private information by adopting a privacy 
policy at least as stringent as our own. If you provide us with your name and 
postal address, we may make this information available to other companies who 
want to mail you information about their products. Of course, you always have 
the option to not have such information shared (For instructions on how to 
insure that this information will not be shared, please see below). Except as 
provided above, as required by law, or in the event of a merger, consolidation, 
or sale of all or substantially all of Rolling Razors assets, we will not sell 
or otherwise share any of your purchase information with any third party without 
your permission.<p></p> 
<p></p><div class="question">How does Rolling Razor safeguard my personal 
information? </div> 
Rolling Razor has implemented a variety of security measures to maintain 
the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained 
behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees 
who have special access rights. When you place orders or access your personal 
information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit 
information supplied by you is transmitted via secure technology and securely

<p></p><div class="question">Does Rolling Razor use "cookies"? </div> 
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved

site may need to personalize your experience and to gather web site statistical 
data, such as which pages are visited, the internet provider's domain name and 
country that our visitors come from (e.g. "aol.com" or "msn.com") and the 
addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately 
after leaving RollingRazor.com. However, none of this information is associated 
with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. 
The information in the cookies lets us trace your "clickstream" activity (i.e., 
the paths take by visitors to our site as they move from page to page). Cookies 
do not capture your individual email address or any private information about 
you. <p></p> 
<p>Rolling Razor may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our

information and data collected from visitors to our web site. These companies 
may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web 
beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third 
parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous and Rolling 
Razor reserves the right to provide that information and data to these third 
parties.</p> 
<p>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all 
cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different so
