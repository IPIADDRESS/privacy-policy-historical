·	To those suppliers or companies hired to deliver the ROM’s products or services, for example a shipping company that delivers a package.<br>
·	In some instances, for example on-line registration for programs and events, visitors may be asked to submit credit card information for payment. Credit card transactions are managed by payment processing companies with whom the ROM has partnered. The ROM will not authorize these companies to use the information except for the express purpose for which it was provided.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In certain circumstances, the ROM may use your contact information to inform you of other ROM products and services. In addition, you may be provided the opportunity to be informed of the products and services of affiliated organizations and other carefully selected cultural institutions. You will have an opportunity at the time we collect the information to indicate your preference for receiving additional information from the ROM and/or affiliated organizations, and where applicable, for inclusion in information exchanges with other cultural institutions. <span class="bodybold">If you do not wish to have your information used for these or other identified purposes, tell us and we will respect your wishes</span>.
