<strong><a id="_OurSecurityPractices" name="_OurSecurityPractices"></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Security Practices</strong></p>
<p>Our internal data security policies restrict access to customersâ personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customersâ personal information for Mode Media business purposes only. Our employees are bound by Mode Media policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customersâ personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<br>
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customersâ personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to a Mode Media Site, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Mode Media cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with the Mode Media Site.</p>

We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties, or affiliates of Mode Media where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do. For example, we might need to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as advertisers, featured on a Mode Media Site, or through a website participating in the Mode Media Network or a Non-Affiliated Site so they can process and fulfill your request for more information from them; and in these instances, we will provide you with a notice at the time of collection that the information is being shared, to whom it is being shared and the privacy policy governing the use of the information collected and shared. We may share your personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf, or affiliates of Mode Media. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.</p>
