    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <strong>First- And Third-Party Cookies</strong><br>
    <em>Technical Cookies</em> <br>
    Technical cookies are those necessary to display the information on the website properly, or otherwise used to carry out the transmission of a web communication. They are not used for any further purposes and are normally installed directly by the owner or the operator of the website.<br>
    <br>
    Technical cookies can be divided into:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Browsing And Session Cookies: These cookies guarantee regular navigation and use of the site (e.g. allowing authentication to access restricted areas);</li>
        <li>Analytics Cookies: These cookies are used to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors and on how they use the site.</li>
        <li>Functional Cookies: These cookies allow the user to browse as a function of certain pre-determined criteria (e.g., the language, products selected for review, etc.) in order to improve the service offered.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Profiling Cookies</strong><br>
    Profiling cookies are aimed at creating user profiles and are used to send online advertising messages in line with the preferences shown by the user during navigation.<br>
    <br>
    These cookies, either of the Company or of third parties, are accurately selected and checked and are used to guarantee that the marketing messages received through the site or other websites used by the Company to transmit its advertising messages are in line with the visitor’s preferences. This enables the potential to offer pertinent messages, based on previous visits to the site, on the pages visited more frequently and on other data concerning the visitor.

    <li><em>Our Service Providers.</em> We may share your personal information with companies or organizations, including subsidiaries, affiliates, and other entities that perform services on our behalf, such as marketing and website support service providers.</li>
    <li><em>Business Transactions and Transfers.</em> Dow may buy, sell, form, or otherwise reorganize one or more of its businesses or sell stock or assets, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization or liquidation. A transaction of this type may involve the disclosure of your information to prospective purchasers or partners who have signed a confidentiality agreement with Dow.</li>
    <li><em>Compliance with Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others.</em> We may disclose personal information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information to cooperate with a government investigation; to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce or apply our online terms of use or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than as described above, Dow does not provide or sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<h3 id="5">Location of Information</h3>
<p>Dow is a global organization with its corporate headquarters in the United States. Our servers, databases, and service providers are located in the United States and in other countries. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements, and some, including the United States, may provide less legal protection for your personal information than others. If you object to the transfer of your information to the United States, please do not use Dow’s website or provide Dow with that information.</p>
<h3 id="6">Use of Special Features or Areas of Our Website</h3>
<p>This Privacy Statement may be supplemented by additional privacy statements that may be specific to individual Dow websites or features, such as our investor and career sites. Dow’s websites may include special features such as surveys, licensed content, online stores, or password protected areas, such as a customer-only area or a careers area, and these areas or websites may be subject to additional terms of use or privacy statements which may further specify additional personal information Dow may collect in these areas, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the use of that information.</p>
<p>When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area, you may be asked to agree to additional terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area. In such cases, you may be asked to expressly consent to the additional terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked “I agree.” (This type of agreement is known as a “click-through” agreement.)  If any of the terms of a click-through agreement or another agreement between you and Dow are different than the terms of this Privacy Statement, the terms of that agreement will control over this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h3 id="7">Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>Dow’s website is not intended for children under 16 years of age, and Dow does not knowingly collect information from children to sell or promote our products or services. No one under the age of 16 may provide information to Dow on or through our website, and if we learn that we have received information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete that information.</p>
<p>Dow may host educational programs in science for students and teachers in our communities, but we do not invite minors to contact us or provide us with personal information. Visitors must be 18 years of age or older to submit registration or survey information. Parents or legal guardians may register to obtain information or participate in a survey on behalf of their children.</p>
<p>If you believe a child under the age of eighteen has sent personal contact information to Dow, please <a href="https://app.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/ffde346b-1286-4be1-9186-0dd389ded92c" target="_blank">contact us</a> immediately and we will use reasonable efforts to promptly remove that information from our systems.</p>
<h3 id="8">Security</h3>
<p>We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information. We urge users to be careful with personal information while using the Internet.</p>
<p><em>SSL Protection.</em> Many Dow websites, including dow.com, are able to provide a secure connection between your computer and our server be established. We use an encryption technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL). A secure connection is maintained until you leave the secure area of the site. Although we use SSL encryption to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information as it travels over the Internet, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet and we cannot guarantee the safety of transmitting personal information over the Internet.</p>
<p><em>Password Protection.</em> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords. We have the right to assume that anyone accessing one of our websites using a password assigned to you has the right to do so. You will be solely responsible for the activities of anyone accessing our website using a password assigned to you, even if the individual is not, in fact authorized by you. If you have reason to believe that your password has been compromised or used without authorization, you must promptly change it using the functionality provided on the site or notify Dow that your account has been compromised.</p>
<h3 id="9">External Links</h3>
<p>Some of our websites may contain links to other websites on the Internet that are not under the control of or maintained by Dow. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Dow of those websites, the content displayed, or the persons or entities associated with them. By visiting a linked website from a Dow website, you acknowledge that Dow is providing these links to you only as a convenience and you agree that Dow is not responsible for the content of such websites. External sites are governed by their own terms and policies and are not governed by Dow's Privacy Statement, Terms of Use, Accessibility Statement, or other terms and policies.</p>
<h3 id="10">Changes to This Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site and updated effective date at the bottom of this page. As we add new features and functionality to our websites or Dow policies or applicable laws evolve, we may need to update or revise this Privacy Statement. We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting a revised version on our website. These changes will be effective as of the date we post a revised version on our website.</p>
<p>If we make changes to this Privacy Statement that materially change how we treat your personal data, we will make a reasonable effort to notify you promptly through reasonable means.</p>
<h3 id="11">Your Choices</h3>
<p>We respect your right to make choices about how you would like to interact with Dow and the extent of the personal information you choose to share with Dow. In some cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal information. If you have previously agreed to receive email or marketing communications from Dow, you may "opt-out" at any time by using the unsubscribe feature included in the e-mails we send.</p>
<h3 id="12">Access, Update or Correct Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you have created an account or a personal profile on one of our websites, you may be able to access and update some or all of your personal information on your account settings or profile page. If you wish to access, update or correct other personal information, please <a href="https://app.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/ffde346b-1286-4be1-9186-0dd389ded92c" target="_blank">contact us</a>. We will contact you and may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will update information as requested. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if permitted or required by law or if we are unable to verify your identity.</p>
