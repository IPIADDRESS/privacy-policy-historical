</ul>

<p>We will not use your personal information to send product or promotional advertising unless you have agreed to receive product or promotional advertising.  Other than the purposes described above, Dow does not sell your personal information to third-parties.</p>
<p id="Location_Info" name="Location_Info"><strong>Location of Information</strong></p>
<p>Dow is a global organization with its corporate headquarters in the United States. Our servers, databases, and service providers are located in the United States and in other countries.  Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements, and some, including the United States, may provide less legal protection for your personal information than others. By using this site, you are consenting to the collection, use and transfer of your personal information in or to the United States or other countries for the purposes described in this Online Privacy Policy.</p>
<p id="Use_of_Special_Features" name="Use_of_Special_Features"><strong>Use of Special Features or Areas of Our Website</strong></p>
<p>Some of our websites include special features, such as surveys, licensed content; or an online store; or password protected areas, such as a customers-only area or a careers area. This Online Privacy Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by privacy statements that are specific to and appear on individual Dow websites, including but not limited to our investor and career sites. Generally, these statements provide details about the personal information we collect or do not collect on particular pages or areas of a website, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the use of that information. </p>
<p>When you sign up to use a special feature or password-protected area, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature or password-protected area. In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked “I agree.” This type of agreement is known as a “click-through” agreement. If any of the terms of a click-through agreement or another agreement between you and Dow are different than the terms of this Online Privacy Policy, the terms of that agreement will govern over this Online Privacy Policy.   </p>
<p id="Children’s_Privacy" name="Children’s_Privacy"><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children to sell or promote our products or services. We host educational programs in science for students and teachers in our communities, but we do not invite minors to contact us or manually provide personal information. Visitors must be 18 years of age or older to submit registration or survey information. Parents or legal guardians may register to obtain information or participate in a survey on behalf of their children. If you believe a child under the age of eighteen has sent personal contact information to Dow, please 
<a href="#Contact_Dow">contact us</a> immediately at the address listed below and we will use reasonable efforts to promptly remove that information from our databases. </p>
<p id="Security" name="Security"><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your personal information.  We urge users to be careful with personal information while using the Internet.</p>
<p><i>SSL Protection</i>. Some password-protected areas of our website, require that a secure connection between your computer and our server be established. We use an encryption technology called Secure Socket Layers (SSL). A secure connection is maintained until you leave the secure area of the site. Although we use SSL encryption to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information as it travels over the Internet, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet and we can not guarantee the safety of transmitting personal information over the Internet. </p>
<p><i>Password Protection.</i> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords. We have the right to assume that anyone accessing one of our websites using a password assigned to you has the right to do so. You will be solely responsible for the activities of anyone accessing our website using a password assigned to you, even if the individual is not, in fact authorized by you. If you have reason to believe that your password has been compromised or used without authorization, you must promptly change it using the functionality provided on the site. </p>
<p id="External_Links" name="External_Links"><strong>External Links</strong></p>
<p>Some of our websites may contain links to other websites on the Internet that are not under the control of or maintained by Dow.

External sites are governed by their own terms and policies and are not governed by Dow's Online Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Accessibility Statement, or other terms and policies.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Online Privacy Policy and related business practices at any time by posting updated text on this site and updated effective date at the top of this page. As we add new features and functionality to our websites or Dow policies or applicable laws evolve, we may need to update or revise this Online Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to do so, at any time and without prior notice, by posting a revised version on our website. These changes will be effective as of the date we post a revised version on our website.  Your use of one of our websites following any such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Online Privacy Policy.  For this reason, it is important for you to review this Online Privacy Policy regularly. </p>
<p id="Your_Choices" name="Your_Choices"><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p>We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information. In some cases, we will ask you to indicate your choices at the time we collect your personal information.  If you receive email or marketing communications, you may "opt-out" of receiving e-mail and other communications from us at any time by using the unsubscribe feature included in the e-mails we send.
