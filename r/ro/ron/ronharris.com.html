	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. We are totally committed to protecting your privacy and security.</strong>
	The following information is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, disseminate and safeguard the information you provide to us while
	accessing and using our Site. By accessing and using our Site, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our information
	practices, please do not access or use our Site. As provided below, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, add or remove portions of this

<p>
	<strong>
		2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information
		</strong></p><p><strong>
		</strong></p><strong>
	</strong>
<p></p>
<p>
	We will be collecting two different types of information about the Website Members of our Site: That being Personally Identifiable Information and
	Non-personally Identifiable Information.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Personally Identifiable Information </strong>
	is information that identifies a particular Member. This information could be collected at different points throughout the site. It is optional for you to
	engage in any action or activity located on the site. If you choose to engage in the activities located on the site we may ask you to provide us with
	certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and
	date of birth. An example would be when you fill out a profile on the site. If and when you order tokens, we may also ask you to provide the processor with
	your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Some of the information we ask you to provide will be identified
	as mandatory and some will be identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular action that requires it, you will
	not be permitted to engage in that activity. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any
	postings, comments, or forums within the RonHarris.com community.
	<br>
	<br>
	We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the
	Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with
	third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you use our Website to send information to another person, we may store your
	personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you,
	enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement
	activities.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
	is information that does not identify a specific Member. This type of information may include, but is not limited to, things like the Uniform Resource
	Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser
	you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect
	this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.
	<br>
	<br>
	We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with
	applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and
	Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. How Do We Share Personal Information</strong>

	<br>
	<br>
	In addition to any other information sharing or disclosure practices described in this Privacy Policy, we may share your Personal Information with third
	party service providers who perform some of our business functions on our behalf. These functions include, without limitation, sending administrative and
	promotional emails, and order processing and fulfillment. For example, we may disclose your billing information to payment processors to process fee
	payments or other financial transactions, or we may disclose your email address to email fulfillment contractors to send you emails from us. The use of
	your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.
	<br>
	<br>
	We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, joint venturers, or other companies under a common control (collectively,
	"affiliates"), in which case we will require these affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
	<br>
	<br>
	As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we
	maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
	<br>
	<br>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
	our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website
	Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Members or others.

	Additionally, we may use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistics in order to administer
	and improve our Website. These statistics may also be used for promotional purposes, or to provide a representative audience for Advertisers. This
	information provides only general summaries of End User activities, and it does not include Personal Information.
