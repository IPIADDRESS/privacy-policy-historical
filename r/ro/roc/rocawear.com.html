  <h4>II. HOW IS MY  INFORMATION USED?</h4><br>
  a. User  Identification<br>
  For our sites  that offer user registration, we may retain this information on a secure server  so that on re-visiting our Site, you will not need to re-enter that  information. We may use this information in an aggregated form to measure  number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and other  relevant statistics.

  (iii) We are  required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other requirement of law which  requires disclosure of your information.<br>

For example, we may track the number of our users who view  certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of  sales conducted through the Site in a particular geographic region or to track  purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from  individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you  with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising of the  Site.

  <h4>V. YOUR  CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS (As provided by California Civil Code Section  1798.83)</h4><br>
  A California  resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she  has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household  purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information  about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third  parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. In general, if the  business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a  request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of  all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding  calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that  were disclosed.<br>
  However,  under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists  if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy Policy) a  Privacy Policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third  parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first  affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and  discloses this Privacy Policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by  notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal  information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.<br>
  As stated in  this Privacy Policy, we do not share information with third parties for their  direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure --  typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is  participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If you  do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing  purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific  promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual  basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct  marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide  personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that  whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information  will be subject to the third party's privacy Policy. If you later decide that  you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to  contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties  use information. You should always review the privacy Policy of any party that  collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your  information.<br>
  California  customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by  e-mailing <a href="mailto:info@iconixbrand.com">info@iconixbrand.com</a>.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer  each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other  than through this e-mail address. <br>
  a. Limitation  of Liability<br>
  IN NO EVENT  SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR SPECIAL  DAMAGES, (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR  ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION  OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE  LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF THE FOREGOING  LIMITATIONS ARE HELD INAPPLICABLE OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE  MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF US TO YOU FOR ANY TYPE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE  GREATER OF THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR ANY PRODUCTS OFFERED ON THE  WEBSITE OR U.S. $100.00.<br>
  b.  Miscellaneous<br>
  The Privacy  Policy for the Site established by us constitutes ours and your entire  understanding with respect to the use of the Site. We control and/or operate  the Site from offices in the United States of America. We do not represent that  materials on the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Persons who choose to access this Site from other locations do so on their own  initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local  laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.&nbsp; Please note that <a href="http://www.rocawear.com">www.rocawear.com</a> has no direct  affiliation with <a href="http://www.drjays.com">www.drjays.com</a> and is not  responsible for any and all harm caused by <a href="http://www.drjays.com">www.drjays.com</a>.  This Privacy Policy shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State  of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. You agree to  personal jurisdiction by the federal and state courts located in New York  County, New York State. No waiver by use of any breach or default hereunder  shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or  default. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any  claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site must be  filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be  forever barred. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions and Privacy  P9olicy is found to be unenforceable for any reason, than that provision shall  be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any  remaining provisions.<br>
  <h4>VII. CHANGES  TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h4><br>
  We may revise  this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice  to you. Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting. It is your  obligation to review the Privacy Policy from time to time.<p></p>
