    	<p><strong><a name="1">When This Privacy Policy Applies.</a></strong></p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Sites via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a "<em class="underline">Device</em>") and whether you are accessing the Sites as a registered user (if offered by the Sites) or other user of the Sites. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by the Sites and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner (such as by Harmonix or Rock Band not through the Sites) or by any other website offered by Harmonix, the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, "<em class="underline">Affiliates</em>") or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Sites or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered through the Sites terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Sites or any features, activities or services offered through the Sites.</p>

		<p><strong><a name="2">U.S. Governing Law.</a></strong></p>
		<p>The Sites are designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that these Sites are operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. By participating in our Sites' activities, you certify that you meet the age and other eligibility requirements for these Sites as set forth in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. If you do not meet the age and other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using the Sites immediately as your continued use of the Sites indicates that you are agreeing to the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S., you do so at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information and Other Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of these Sites will be collected in the U.S. and/or transferred to the U.S. and subject to U.S. law. By using these Sites, participating in any Site activities and/or providing us with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information to and in the U.S., (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law provides a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of various countries including, but not limited to, the European Union and (iii) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and U.S. law. Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction.</p>

            	<p>Information We Collect that You Provide Us.</p>

				<ol class="iii">
            		<li>
                    	<p>User Registration. To the extent we offer user registration on the Sites, to register as a member of any of the Sites, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "<em class="underline">User ID</em>") and may be required to also provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).</p>
					</li>
                    <li>
						<p>In Connection with Certain Features and Functions. We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Sites, such as the option to subscribe to a selection of free email newsletters and other periodic information, chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages. To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, to sign up to receive email newsletters, you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code separate from any user registration. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Sites (<em>e.g.,</em> the referring URL).

					</li>
                    <li>
						<p>In Connection with Promotions such as Contests and Sweepstakes.

				</ol>
			</li>
            <li>
				<p>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</p>

				<p>We use Tracking Technologies to collect "<em class="underline">click stream</em>" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Sites, such as your visits to the Sites' web pages, use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Sites ("<em class="underline">Identifier</em>").

By visiting the Sites, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Sites.</p>

				<p>These Sites may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<em class="underline">Third Party Advertising Service Providers</em>") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Sites ("<em class="underline">Targeting Services</em>"). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Sites and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. </p>

				<p>Although these Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Sites, the Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as Advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about you.</p>

The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>

		<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>

		<p>Users that register for Harmonix’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Harmonix. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Sites, Harmonix, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</p>
		<ol class="abc">
			<li>
            	<p>Registration. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Harmonix’s wireless marketing services.  Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "<em class="underline">single opt-in</em>" or the "<em class="underline">double-opt-in</em>" (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Harmonix depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the "<em class="underline">double opt-in</em>" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
				<ol class="iii">
					<li>
                    	<p>Single Opt-in Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Harmonix will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Harmonix to send text messages to him or her. Harmonix will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "<em class="underline">Thank you</em>" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Harmonix or by sending a text message to Harmonix that says "<em class="underline">STOP</em>", "<em class="underline">END</em>", "<em class="underline">CANCEL</em>", "<em class="underline">REMOVE</em>", "<em class="underline">UNSUBSCRIBE</em>" or "<em class="underline">QUIT</em>". </p>
					</li>
                    <li>
						<p>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to these Sites to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Harmonix’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Harmonix) and by clicking the consent statement on the respective Site’s registration page. The user must also agree to the respective Site’s Privacy Policy and <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> before the online registration process is completed. Harmonix will then send a "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Harmonix to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).The user must respond to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message with a text message that states "<em class="underline">YES</em>" or "<em class="underline">Y</em>" that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Harmonix’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message at any time provided that Harmonix may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" is only valid if the response is received while Harmonix continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
					</li>
                    <li>
						<p>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Harmonix will then send a "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Harmonix to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).The user must respond to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation,</em>" message with a text message that states "<em class="underline">YES</em>" or "<em class="underline">Y</em>" that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Harmonix’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" message at any time provided that Harmonix may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the "<em class="underline">Confirmation</em>" is only valid if the response is received while Harmonix continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
            <li>
				<p>Termination of Wireless Services by User. Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Harmonix by the following procedure:</p>

				<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Harmonix at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "<em class="underline">STOP</em>", "<em class="underline">END</em>", "<em class="underline">CANCEL</em>", "<em class="underline">REMOVE</em>", "<em class="underline">UNSUBSCRIBE</em>" or "<em class="underline">QUIT</em>". Harmonix will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "<em class="underline">ALL</em>" in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with Harmonix. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Harmonix service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in. </p>
			</li>
            <li>
				<p>Termination of Wireless Services by Harmonix. A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Harmonix may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Harmonix may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on the Sites. </p>

            <li>
				<p>Use of Information. Harmonix will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.

		<p><strong><a name="7">Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.</a></strong></p>

		<p>Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Sites by, if you are a registered user of the Sites and logged into the Sites, by clicking "<em class="underline">My Profile</em>" at the top of the Sites and then selecting "<em class="underline">Edit Profile</em>". However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.</p>

		<p>Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory record keeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.</p>

		<p>If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.</p>

		<p>Children or Ineligible Teenagers. If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Sites, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of these Sites ("<em class="underline">Ineligible Teenagers</em>"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the "<em class="underline">Parent</em>") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).</p>

		<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership [must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "<em class="underline">Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use</em>" Section of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively, Parents may send an email to <a href="mailto:support@harmonixmusic.com">support@harmonixmusic.com</a> and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.

Harmonix will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. </p>
