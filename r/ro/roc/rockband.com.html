<p>Last Updated: September 23, 2008<br>
 <a href="/terms">Go to Terms of Use</a></p>
<h2>PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>This is the official privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for rockband.com, 
  rockband2.com and rockbandstore.com ("Sites," "we," 
  "us," or "our"). The Sites are provided by Harmonix 
  Music Systems, Inc. ("Harmonix"), a subsidiary of Viacom International 
  Inc. (the "Parent Company"), together with other subsidiaries and 
  affiliates of the Parent Company, including, without limitation, MTV Networks, 
  a division of the Parent Company (collectively, "Affiliates"). This 
  Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("Personal 
  Information") collected by these Sites and does not cover any such information 
  collected in any other manner or for any other purpose by Harmonix, the Parent 
  Company and any Affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>
<p>Overview:<br><br> This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices 
  and inform you as to: The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users 
  of the Sites and how that information is collected; How we use your Personal 
  Information; The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information 
  to third parties; How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information 
  collected about you by us; and The mechanisms we have implemented to protect 
  your Personal Information.</p>
<p>These Sites are offered and made available only to users 14 years of age or 
  older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions 
  ("U.S."). If you are not yet 14 years old, or do not reside in the 
  U.S., please discontinue using the Sites immediately, or if, for any reason, 
  you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the 
  features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal 
  Information. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which 
  are set forth in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> ("Agreement").</p>
<p>Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning 
  given in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Both the Privacy Policy and Agreement are 
  legally binding on all users. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating 
  this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective 
  to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document 
  will be posted on the Sites' homepages and/or will be provided by e-mailing 
  you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice 
  is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy 
  and <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> often for updates. </p>
<p>We are committed to protecting our users' privacy. Keeping the Personal 
  Information you share with us on the Sites secure and ensuring your understanding 
  of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important 
  to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
  to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the 
  Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use 
  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>

<hr class="small">
<h3><strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></h3>
  <p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil 
  Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California 
  a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information 
  during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the 
  law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out 
  (which we may sometimes refer to as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice 
  for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or 
  affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide 
  you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>
<p>These Sites qualify for the alternative option; the Sites have a comprehensive 
  Privacy Policy and provide you with details on how you may either opt-out or 
  opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing 
  purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the 
  third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes 
  during the preceding year.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise 
  your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following 
  address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent 
  (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:mtvi-admin@mtvn.com">mtvi-admin@mtvn.com</a>, 
  or you may contact us via regular mail at:</p>

<li>1515 Broadway NY, NY 10036</li>
<li>Attn: Your California Privacy Rights c/o Privacy Administrator</li>
</ul>
<p>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy 
  Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual 
  request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, 
  and zip code. (Your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response 
  to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping.) 
  We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible 
  for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.</p>
<p>To all other users of these Sites, if you have other questions about this Privacy 
  Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:mtvi-admin@mtvn.com">mtvi-admin@mtvn.com</a> or:</p>

<h3><strong>GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</strong></h3>
 <p> These Sites are designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and 
  operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that 
  these Sites are operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed 
  by, other nations. By your participation in our Sites activities, you certify 
  that you are at least 14 years of age and a resident of the U.S. If you are 
  located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate 
  in activities on these Sites contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents 
  are eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, 
  and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and 
  national laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to 
  us or we obtain as a result of your use of these Sites will be transferred to 
  the U.S. and subject to U.S. law. By using these Sites, participating in any 
  Site activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent 
  to this transfer and processing of Personal Information to and in the U.S., 
  and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or 
  a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European 
  Economic Area. Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under 
  the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction. 
  All users of the Sites are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate 
  Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that 
  we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this 
  Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Sites indicates your acceptance of 
  this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage 
  of your Personal Information as described below. We may from time to time, transfer 
  or merge any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases 
  or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal 
  Information we collect online with information available from other sources, 
  including information received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or 
  Advertisers (as defined in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>). This Privacy Policy 
  covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect 
  as long as you are a user of the Sites even if your use of or participation 
  in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, 
  expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.</p>
<p>1. Collection and Use of Personal Information: When we use the term "Personal 
  Information" we mean information such as your first/middle initial or 
  name and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone 
  number, instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date 
  of birth, e-mail address, gender, ethnicity and any other information that would 
  allow someone to identify you or contact you. Personal Information also includes 
  information about your personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions 
  or relationship with us, if you have been a customer or a user of the Sites 
  or you have provided this type of information to any of the MTV Networks family 
  of companies. For example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order 
  any of our various Products (as defined in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), in addition 
  to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain your 
  billing address, shipping address, Product selections, your credit card or other 
  payment instrument information, your order number, and information about your 
  computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed 
  you to the Sites (e.g., the referring URLs). Your credit card or debit card 
  number is classified as "Sensitive Personal Information" and is 
  collected via a secure transmission.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Sites and input 
  information, whether you are registering to use any services, features or functions 
  of the Sites, participating in Promotions (as defined in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), 
  ordering or purchasing Products or in the course of any other exchanges of information, 
  transactions and activities. We may use the information we obtain from you, 
  including Personal Information, to tailor your experience on the Sites, to display 
  content we think may be of interest to you, or to let us customize what you 
  see when you visit the Sites according to your preferences and personal characteristics.</p>
<p>a. Collection of Personal Information During Registration. To the extent we 
  offer user registration on the Sites, to register as a member of the Sites, 
  you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "User 
  ID"), and may be required to also provide other Personal Information, 
  such as your email address, first and last name, gender, date of birth, country 
  and zip code. Additional Personal Information may be requested during the registration 
  process (but not required), such as cable/satellite provider, ethnic information, 
  and annual income. We will allow you to change the password portion of your 
  User ID, as well as certain other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal 
  Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but 
  once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided 
  to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID. Among other 
  things, these kinds of information help us securely identify you as a registered 
  or permitted user of the Sites and our features and functions. You will not 
  be able to change your date of birth without sufficient verification.</p>
<p>All member benefits are free. As a registered user of the Sites, from time 
  to time, we may also provide you with certain options to subscribe to a selection 
  of free email newsletters and other periodic information. You may select such 
  options by opting-in at the time of registration or by responding to an offer 
  or invitation at a later date. You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe) 
  or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User ID and changing 
  the settings in your account. You may also opt-out to particular email communications 
  by responding to that email and using the "unsubscribe" or opt-out 
  procedure included in that communication.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree 
  that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of 
  the Sites in connection with your registration. You also agree to this Privacy 
  Policy and the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.</p>
<p>b. Collection of Personal Information During Registration or In Connection 
  with Certain Features and Functions.</p>
<p>During registration (and possibly at certain other times to enable your use 
  of other features or functions or for security purposes), you will be required 
  to provide us with certain information about you in order for us to personalize 
  and allow you to use the features and functions that we may offer on the Sites, 
  such as chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, 
  auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages.</p>
<p>c. Collection of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions such as 
  Contests and Sweepstakes: To the extent we offer user registration on the Sites, 
  registration as a member of the Sites is not always required to enter Promotions 
  such as contests and sweepstakes. There may be a separate registration process 
  which will require the submission of all or some of the following: your first 
  and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone 
  number and date of birth. Additional Personal Information may be requested depending 
  on the specific Promotion, but submission of such information may be optional. 
  The Promotion's entry page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements. 
  You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to special Promotions or offers 
  from our Advertisers in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</p>
<p>d. Use of Personal Information in Connection with Personalized Advertising. 
  We may use characteristics about you such as age, gender and/or ethnicity for 
  personalizing the online advertising from third parties that you see when you 
  visit the Sites. This information may be used to send you personalized advertising 
  in combination with non-Personal Information such as your website viewing, usage 
  and purchasing history, which is not part of your user profile. (For more information, 
  please see "Cookies and Other Technology" section.) You submit this 
  Personal Information at the time of your registration; it is part of your online 
  profile and associated with your User ID. We use third party ad servers to deliver 
  personalized advertising to you. However, neither these ad servers nor their 
  advertisers will have access to your individual online profile or your age, 
  gender and ethnicity information. These third parties only deliver designated 
  advertising to a targeted group of users which have been identified by the Sites 
  based on certain characteristics and the Sites instruct the third parties to 
  serve the ads but the identity or characteristics of an individual user is unknown 
  to the third parties. Age, gender and/or ethnicity is only disclosed to third 
  parties in the aggregate and cannot be used to identify an individual user. 
  By registering for the Sites, you have affirmatively consented to the use of 
  such information for personalized advertising. In order to withdraw your consent 
  to use such information for personalized advertising, you shall need to deactivate 
  your account on the Site by following the procedures set forth in Section 13 
  of the "<a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>" labeled "Deactivation/Termination 
  of Your Registration or Use".</p>
<p>e. Use of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions and Offers; Opt-out 
  Procedures. We, or our Affiliates, may contact the Site's registered users 
  or other users that have registered for or participated in various Site events, 
  Promotions, or transactions, or we may send offers for the purchase of goods 
  and/or services that may of interest to users.</p>
<p>You may "opt out" of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails 
  or text messages from us by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in 
  an email or text message. However, we, or our Affiliates, may continue to contact 
  you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up 
  messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features 
  or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any Promotions you have 
  participated in or have entered, goods and/or services or Products you have 
  ordered, or other transactions you have undertaken with the Sites. In the event 
  that we, or our Affiliates, unknowingly sends an email or text message to a 
  child (a person under the age of 14 years) who has registered with the Sites 
  in violation of the Sites' <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, the child or the child's 
  parent or legal guardian always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from 
  receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained 
  in the email or message, or to request termination of the child's registration 
  and status as a registered user with the Sites. The same unsubscribe process 
  is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age 
  of 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state). Please see the "Review, 
  Update, or Delete Your Personal Information" Section below for details.</p>
<p>f. Sharing of Aggregate Information with Third Parties. Some of the aggregate 
  user data we collect may be shared with Advertisers, our Affiliates, and other 
  business partners of the Sites, Harmonix and/or its Affiliates, but we do not 
  give any Personal Information to them as part of the relationship except as 
  described in this Privacy Policy. Use of their tracking technology is subject 
  to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>g. Use of Communities. If you use any of the Communities' features and 
  functions made available on or through the Sites, please remember that any information 
  disclosed in these venues is automatically made public. You should exercise 
  caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you 
  do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes. 
  Harmonix is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information, 
  including Personal Information, that you disclose or receive through these venues 
  and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be 
  available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization. </p>
  2. Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities: Harmonix may provide 
  its website users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, 
  services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and 
  other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users 
  are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Harmonix, 
  either by registering on these Sites or via their wireless device. Such services 
  and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for Harmonix. The Personal 
  Information requested as part of the online registration process may include 
  a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically 
  requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested 
  for specific Promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods 
  or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. 
  Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or 
  other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may 
  also be required to confirm his or her agreement to the Sites' Privacy 
  Policy and the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.<p></p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a 
  greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a 
  user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for Harmonix's wireless marketing services acknowledge, 
  understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless 
  carrier for all messages sent to the user from Harmonix. Standard messaging 
  rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Sites, 
  Harmonix, the Parent Company or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email 
  or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access 
  to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p>a. Registration. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there 
  are two registration methods provided for Harmonix's wireless marketing 
  services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the "single 
  opt-in" or the "double-opt-in (Site/SMS)" method, at the discretion 
  of Harmonix depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require 
  the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>1) Single Opt-in Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, 
  or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word 
  or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for 
  the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated 
  word or code to Harmonix will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively 
  granted permission to Harmonix to send text messages to him or her. Harmonix 
  will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" 
  message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe 
  command in any text message from Harmonix or by sending a text message to Harmonix 
  that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", 
  "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT".</p>
<p>2) Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, 
  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to these Sites 
  to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Harmonix's 
  sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting 
  a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Harmonix) 
  and by clicking the consent statement on the Sites' registration page. 
  The user must also agree to the Sites' Privacy Policy and Agreement before 
  the online registration process is completed. Harmonix will then send a "Confirmation" 
  message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that 
  the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Harmonix 
  to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). 
  The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text 
  message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate 
  the user's acceptance of Harmonix's wireless marketing service. 
  Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user 
  is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the 
  Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any 
  time provided that Harmonix may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing 
  service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" 
  is only valid if the response is received while Harmonix continues to offer 
  the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p>3) Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, 
  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific 
  word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register 
  for the service promoted. Harmonix will then send a "Confirmation" 
  message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that 
  the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Harmonix 
  to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). 
  The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text 
  message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate 
  the user's acceptance of Harmonix's wireless marketing service. 
  Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user 
  is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the 
  Promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any 
  time provided that Harmonix may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing 
  service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" 
  is only valid if the response is received while Harmonix continues to offer 
  the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User. Regardless of which one of the 
  above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to 
  receive messages from Harmonix by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any 
  time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Harmonix at the time the 
  message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", 
  "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" 
  or "QUIT". Harmonix will terminate the user's registration 
  for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed 
  by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel 
  all of the user's registered wireless services with Harmonix. If the user 
  unsubscribes from one or all of Harmonix service(s) via his or her wireless 
  device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's 
  previous opt-in.</p>
<p>c. Termination of Wireless Services by Harmonix A user understands, acknowledges 
  and agrees that Harmonix may, in its sole discretion and without liability to 
  any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or 
  all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Harmonix 
  may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on the Sites.</p>
<p>d. Use of Information Harmonix will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless 
  or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted 
  for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the 
  service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will 
  not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers 
  unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share such Personal Information 
  with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless 
  services to you and with the Parent Company and Affiliates.</p>
<p>3. Accuracy and Confidentiality: It is your responsibility to give us current, 
  complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, 
  and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible 
  for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, 
  truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update 
  such information or Personal Information.</p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your 
  User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities 
  and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, 
  and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use 
  and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or any other activity or 
  conduct in connection with the Site by any others who use your User ID, unless 
  and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated 
  or improperly taken or used by another party.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that when you submit information to us, it does not guarantee 
  that we will permit you to use any or all of the features or functions of the 
  Sites.</p>
  <p>4. Cookies and Other Technologies: We use ‘cookies' and other similar 
  tracking technologies, such as web beacons (also known as image tags, GIF or 
  web bugs) to collect non-personal "click stream" data regarding 
  your visits to the Sites, such as your visits to the Sites' webpages, 
  use of our features, and purchasing history or preferences. Your Personal Information 
  (such as name, email address and credit card account information) is not collected 
  as part of this process.</p>
  <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technology in a variety of ways, including: 
  Keeping count of your return visits to the Sites or Harmonix's, the Parent 
  Company's or our Affiliates', Advertisers' or partners' 
  sites; Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection 
  with the Sites; Determining which features users like best; and Saving your 
  user name, your password or other information so you don't have to re-enter 
  it each time you visit the Sites.</p>
  <p>The Sites may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites 
  and organizations that are not affiliated with Harmonix, but are provided by 
  a variety of Advertisers or third-party network ad servers that may also use 
  cookies to deliver personalized advertising messages to you based on your individual 
  interests, website viewing habits, purchasing history or preferences ("Behavioral 
  Personalized Advertising") and/or your general characteristics (such as 
  age, gender and ethnicity) ("Characteristics Personalized Advertising"). 
  If you do not wish to receive Behavioral Personalized Advertising, please see 
  the opt-out instructions below; if you do not wish to receive Characteristics 
  Personalized Advertising, please see the "Use of Personal Information 
  in Connection with Personalized Advertising" section (Section 1(d)) above 
  for how to withdraw your consent. </p>
<p>Opting out to an ad server cookie does not mean that you will no longer receive 
  online ads. Opting out means only that such ads will no longer be tailored to 
  your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads 
  on this Site.</p>
<p>These third party Advertisers and network ad servers may employ their own cookies 
  and other technology to provide personalized advertising and measure advertising 
  effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, 
  use or disclosure of your Personal Information and website viewing/usage information 
  by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other 
  websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of cookies and similar technology 
  by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have 
  a relationship with the third party, we do not control those websites or their 
  policies and practices regarding your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy 
  does not cover any use of Personal Information or website viewing/usage information 
  that a third party Advertiser or ad server may directly collect from you. We 
  encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. 
  Use of Advertisers' tracking technology is subject to their own privacy 
  policies. For more information about these third party servers and how to "opt 
  out" of the ad-serving cookie, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">click here</a>. DOUBLE CLICK PRIVACY 
  POLICY</p>
<p>Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update 
  the Sites and enhance the experience for all users, Personal Information is 
  not extracted in this process. We use tracking information on an aggregated 
  basis to help us operate the Sites, enhance and improve our services, improve 
  the look of the Sites and display advertising and marketing information. You 
  can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is 
  being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through 
  your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features 
  of the Sites that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable 
  like the features mentioned above and some of our other services will not function 
  properly.</p>
  <p>Notice for Certain Device Manufacturers: Certain device manufacturers, such 
  as Apple, preset their browsers to block cookies from websites other than those 
  you visit directly. As a result, services or advertisements offered by certain 
  ad servers, operational service providers and/or Advertisers which use cookies 
  will not work for browsers left in this default setting. Review your device 
  manufacturers' manual or contact your device manufacturers' customer 
  service for your options.</p>
<p>5. Privacy of Your Postings: We respect the privacy of the contents of any 
  Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting, unless the information 
  is intended to be disclosed (such Personal Information, except as intended to 
  be disclosed, is called "Confidential Personal Information"). However, 
  we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Sites or 
  Confidential Personal Information to a third party, if we believe such action 
  is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce 
  this Privacy Policy or the terms of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, or to protect 
  the interests of our users, Advertisers, the Parent Company, Affiliates, licensors, 
  suppliers, operational service providers, and others. Please see the Terms of 
  Use Agreement for details regarding Postings.</p>
<p>6. Disclosure to Third Parties: We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your 
  Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our Advertisers, 
  except in the limited circumstances listed below. As stated above, we will disclose 
  Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting in connection with 
  the display of and other services relating to such Posting as such Personal 
  Information is intended to be disclosed. When we plan to disclose your Personal 
  Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt in to do so, in which case 
  their use of your information is subject to the Advertisers' own privacy 
  policies. We may disclose Personal Information to Affiliates for marketing and/or 
  administrative purposes and you will have the right to opt-out of such disclosure 
  for marketing purposes. (For opt-out procedures, please see the section of this 
  Privacy Policy above entitled "Use of Personal Information in Connection 
  with Promotions and Offers; Opt-Out Procedures").</p>
<p>a. Co-Branded Services and Features. The Sites may also offer co-branded services 
  and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another 
  company or our Affiliates ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services 
  and features may be hosted on the Sites and/or our Co-Branded Partner's 
  website. We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner 
  and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature 
  means that you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Sites and 
  our Co-Branded Partner to collect and use your Personal Information provided 
  during the registration process and/or in connection with the specific co-branded 
  feature or service for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing 
  or administrative purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's 
  future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need 
  to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified 
  on the co-branded feature or service. Registered or other users that participate 
  in certain services relating to Postings, such as user video uploads, agree 
  to have certain Personal Information posted on the Sites or platforms or, if 
  such feature is offered in connection with a Co-Branded Partner, on our Co-Branded 
  partner's website in connection with the display of the uploaded video 
  and posted on any platform that the uploaded video may be posted. Registered 
  or other users that upload videos may also be required to submit additional 
  Personal Information.</p>
<p>b. Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal 
  Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining 
  the Sites' services, features, functions and operations. We will refer 
  to these third parties as "operational service providers". We use 
  operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, 
  activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we request that 
  our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose 
  your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers 
  that are not associated with the Sites or Harmonix. Additionally, such operational 
  service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information or Sensitive 
  Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<p>c. Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We will make your Personal Information 
  and Sensitive Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties 
  in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity 
  (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); If we believe 
  your actions violate any law, regulation, the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, including, 
  without limitation, this Privacy Policy, or any of our other terms and conditions, 
  Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Sites, 
  or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of the Sites, Harmonix, the 
  Parent Company, the Affiliates, or any of its or their operational service providers, 
  suppliers, Advertisers, customers or users, or any other party; If, in our sole 
  discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate 
  or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, 
  to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; 
  or In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint 
  venture or other business combination involving us, Harmonix, the Parent Company 
  or our Affiliates.</p>
<p>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information: We maintain reasonable 
  standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, 
  it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions 
  or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial 
  transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts 
  of the Sites. We also limit access to the Sites by our own employees to those 
  individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and 
  any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will 
  be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service 
  providers follow the same policy.</p>
<p>8. Phishing: Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal identity 
  data and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use ‘spoofed' 
  e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients 
  into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, 
  passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO 
  PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! 
  If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the 
  Sites' Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:mtvi-admin@mtvn.com">mtvi-admin@mtvn.com</a>, and then immediately 
  delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
<p>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information: Generally, you may review, 
  update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information 
  collected by the Sites. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, 
  Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of 
  birth or age cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification 
  of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal 
  Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result 
  in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have 
  made. To review, update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal 
  Information collected by the Sites, please click "MY ACCOUNT" on 
  the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your user name and password. 
  Then, click on "SETTINGS" to change, update, or delete your Personal 
  Information. If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions 
  such as contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Sites' 
  Privacy Administrator via email with a request at <a href="mailto:mtvi-admin@mtvn.com">mtvi-admin@mtvn.com</a> and be 
  prepared to provide verification of your identity. Personal Information collected 
  for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements 
  and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is 
  a child under the age of 14 years old. Children under the age of 14 that are 
  unknowingly registered on the Sites are in violation of this Agreement. Parents 
  (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Sites in violation 
  of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> who wish to terminate their child's membership 
  must use their child's user name and password (User ID) to gain direct 
  access to the account, and select "SETTINGS" or alternatively, you 
  can send us an email to the Sites' Privacy Administrator and provide us 
  with your child's User ID and request to terminate your child's 
  account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user's 
  account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User 
  ID. (Please see above for how to change your preferences or the information 
  associated with your account.) If a parent does not have his or her child's 
  User ID, the parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator 
  that includes the parent's name, address, telephone and email address, 
  in addition to the child's name and email address as registered on the 
  Sites, plus the child's date of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable 
  identification that they are the parent of the ineligible child. Harmonix will 
  send a confirming email to the parent via the email address provided to verify 
  that the parent wishes to terminate his or her child's account and registration. 
  The parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return 
  address. Harmonix will then terminate the child's account but will notify 
  the child of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address 
  and email address of the person making the request.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any 
  user, including, without limitation, a registered user of any services, features 
  or functions of the Sites if we believe there is a question about the identity 
  of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features 
  or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal 
  Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate 
  rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such 
  information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access 
  cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.<br>
  10. Questions: If you have questions about our Privacy Policy or if you do not 
  understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share your 
  Personal Information, you may contact us directly by clicking here.</p>
<p>11. Sole Statement: This document is the sole statement of the Sites' 
  Privacy Policy, and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other 
  privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, 
  is valid.</p>
