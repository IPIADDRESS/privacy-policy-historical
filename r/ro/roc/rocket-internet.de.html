Unless specifically stated, we store personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes pursued.</p>

After cancellation, your email address will be removed from our distribution list, as far as you have not expressly consented to a further use of your data or we reserve the right to further data usage, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this statement.</p>

<p>If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and you have the following rights vis-à-vis the data controller:</p>

<h6>Right of Access</h6>

<p>Right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR: You have the right to obtain information about the personal data processed by us, the processing purposes, the categories of processed personal data, the recipients or categories of recipients to whom your data was or are being disclosed, the planned period of storage or the criteria for determining the duration of storage, the right of correction, deletion, limitation of processing, objection to processing, complaint to a supervisory authority, the origin of your data, if they were not collected by us, the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and possibly significant information on the logic applied and the scope and intended impact of such processing, as well as your right to be informed of what guarantees according to Art. 46 GDPR exist in case of redirection of data in third countries;</p>

<h6>Right to Correction</h6>

<p>Right to correction according to Art. 16 GDPR: You have the right to immediate correction of incorrect data concerning you and/or completion of incomplete data;</p>

<h6>Right to Deletion</h6>

<p>Right to deletion according to Art. 17 DSGVO: You have the right to demand the deletion of your personal data if the requirements of Art. 17 (1) GDPR are met. This right does not apply if the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the pursuit, exercise or defense of rights;</p>

<h6>Right to Restriction of Processing</h6>

<p>Right to restriction of processing according to Art. 18 GDPR: You have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data provided that the correctness of your data is verified, if you refuse to delete your data due to inadmissible data processing and instead restrict the processing of your data, if you need your data for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal rights, after we no longer require these data for their purpose, or if you have objected for reasons of your particular situation, as long as it is not ascertained, whether our legitimate reasons prevail;</p>

<h6>Information to Third Parties</h6>

<p>Right to information in accordance to Art. 19 GDPR: If you exercise the right to correct, delete, or limit the processing towards the responsible contact, this person is obliged to inform all recipients who have been disclosed personal data about the correction, deletion, or limitation of processing of the data, unless this is impossible or requires a disproportionate effort.

<p>Right to revoke granted consent according to Art. 7 (3) GDPR: You have the right to revoke consent provided in the processing of data at any time with effect for the future. In the case of revocation, we will delete the respective data immediately, as far as further processing cannot be legally justified for processing without consent. The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation;</p>

<h6>Right to file a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority</h6>

<p>Right to file a complaint according to Art. 77 GDPR: If you consider the processing of your personal data a violation of the GDPR, you have the right to file a complaint to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of your location, your place of work, or the place of alleged infringement.</p>

<h6>Right to Objection</h6>

<p dir="ltr">If you have given your consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR) to the processing of your data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Such a withdrawal influences the permissibility of processing your personal data after you have provided it to us.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If we base the processing of your personal data on the weighing of interests (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR), you may object to the processing at any time. In the event of your justified objection, we will either stop or adjust data processing or point out to you our compelling reasons worthy of protection, on the basis of which we will continue (possibly limited) processing.</p>
