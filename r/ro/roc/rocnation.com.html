<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs</strong>. This Site’s web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

When you visit the Site, a cookie will be placed on your computer and when you visit the Site again, the cookie will help the Site recognize your computer’s browser as a previous visitor and that information along with information about other visitors to the Site collected using cookies help provide us with an understanding of how visitors to the Site use the Site (e.g., which pages of the site are most visited and whether a particular user tends to go to certain sections of the Site more than others). We utilize two types of cookies – “session” and “persistent”. A persistent cookie continues to collect information about your visits and behavior on the Site each time you visit the Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. For example, if you use a standard browser, you should have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate). For more information on modifying your browser preference, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. You can also visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.youronlinechoices.eu for comprehensive information on how to manage cookies.</li>

We and our service providers may also use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1×1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.</li>

We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to data analysis, order fulfillment, credit card processing and other services of an administrative nature. If you use our services, we reserve the right to share your Personal Information with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide such services. We take reasonable steps to ensure these third parties treat Personal Information in a manner comparable to how we do so.</li>
<li><strong> Online Surveys/Sweepstakes and Contests</strong>. If we administer a promotion or marketing event on the Site in conjunction with a third party (a “Promotion”), you grant us the right to share Personal Information collected in connection with such Promotion with the third party partner if you decide to participate in such Promotion or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion, which will be made available to you. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor’s or other third party’s use of your Personal Information. To the extent such rules conflict with this Privacy Policy, such rules will govern that particular Promotion.</li>
<li><strong> Compliance With Applicable Law</strong>. Roc Nation may also access and disclose Personal Information as needed to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Roc Nation, Site visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms of Use or other published guidelines.</li>
<li><strong> Assignment</strong>. We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from users of the Site to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of Roc Nation’s business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). If we do so, we will notify you by the same means we will as when there is a material change in our Privacy Policy (as described above).</li>
<li><strong> Collection of Information By Third Parties </strong></li>
<li><strong> Co-Branded Pages</strong>. We may enter into relationships with “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “<strong>co-branded pages</strong>”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity. You should look for a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any Personal Information that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our third-party partner. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, our partners’ use of your Personal Information. You should check our posted partners’ websites for information regarding their privacy policies.</li>
<li><strong> Transactions With E-Commerce Partners, Vendors and Advertisers</strong>. When you provide Personal Information to one of our Site’s e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, this transaction will occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser, not on the Site, and, as such, the Personal Information you provide is collected pursuant to and controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser. Roc Nation is not responsible for such parties’ privacy policies and we encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business or to contact the operator of such site for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please be aware that at times, at the request of or on behalf of our e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers, Roc Nation may “pre-populate” forms with your Personal Information for your review, and, if you so choose, for submission to such e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers. Accordingly, we encourage you to review each pre-populated form carefully before agreeing to submit your Personal Information to determine who is seeking to collect your information, and to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy governing use of any Personal Information collected about you.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Job Postings</strong>. If you choose to respond to a job posting on the Site, you may be directed to a third-party site (for example, a third-party site specializing in job postings, such as Monster.com). Any Personal Information you provide will be collected by such third party. We have no control over, and are not responsible or liable for, such third party’s use of your Personal Information. Please consult such third party’s privacy policy for information regarding their privacy practices.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third party collecting your Personal Information will share such Personal Information with Roc Nation so that Roc Nation can review your information and, if applicable, respond to your query or job application. Please note that Roc Nation has no obligation to respond to all queries or job applications submitted. Any Personal Information that Roc Nation receives from such third party will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Third Party Advertising</strong>. The ads appearing on this Site are delivered to you by our Web advertising partner. Non-Personal Information about your visits to this Site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad, is used to serve ads to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</li>
<li><strong> Third Party Links</strong>. The Site may contain links to third-party Internet websites, which are not owned or operated by Roc Nation. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Roc Nation. If you provide any Personal Information through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on such third party’s website (not the Site) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third-party websites, including such websites’ use of any Personal Information that you provide to them. We strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of those sites.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Opt-In Policy</strong></li>
<li><strong> Roc Nation Communications</strong>. When you supply Roc Nation with Personal Information, from time-to-time, in Roc Nation’s discretion, you may be asked to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information from us about special offers in connection with the Site, Roc Nation and/or our advertisers and partners. If you do choose to opt-in to receive such communications, we may, from time to time, send you marketing communications. If at any time you change your mind and no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you may opt-out of such marketing communications by either:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>using the link provided in our newsletters or commercial email messages to opt-out of receiving further marketing communications from us; or</li>
<li>changing your contact preference to “Do Not Contact Me” at any time by using the “Ask a Question” tab on our Help Page.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to contact us to change your contact preference, Roc Nation will implement this change promptly. Please be aware that your requested change will not be effective until Roc Nation implements such change and such requests will be implemented only in connection with your Site profile, and will not impact any preferences you may have made to any other site controlled, owned or operated by Roc Nation or its affiliates.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Affiliate and Third Party Communications</strong>. From time-to-time in Roc Nation’s discretion, you may be provided with the opportunity to opt-in to receive offers directly from Roc Nation, our affiliates and/or from third parties. If you do choose to accept any such offer(s), any Personal Information provided to Roc Nation for such purposes may be shared with our affiliates and such third-party partner(s), to allow our affiliates and/or such third parties to provide you with such offers. If you change your mind and would prefer that we no longer share your Personal Information with our affiliates and/or with third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of such future sharing at any time by using the “Ask a Question” tab on our Help Page, and specifying which choice you are opting out from.</li>
<li><strong> Allowing Roc Nation to share Personal Information with affiliates for their marketing purposes and/or Allowing Roc Nation to share Personal Information with third-party companies for their marketing purposes</strong>. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, (i) we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from the databases of affiliates or third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Information (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request), therefore you must contact such affiliates or third parties directly in order to opt-out of further marketing communications made directly from them or utilize the opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing messages; and (ii) you may still be presented with new offers from Roc Nation and/or its affiliates or third parties while you are within the Site, including offers from those third parties which you have opted-out of receiving direct offers; but in connection with each new offer within the Site you will have the right not to accept such offers. In the event you receive an offer from a third party through our Site, but choose not to accept it, your Personal Information will not be shared.</li>
<li><strong> Use of This Site by Children.</strong> The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Site. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal information without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example, misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at <u>privacy@rocnation.com</u>. If Roc Nation determines that it has collected personal information of children under the age of 13, Roc Nation will immediately delete such information and any accounts believed to be held by children under 13. Please see our Terms of Use for additional information regarding the use of this Site by minors.</li>
<li><strong> Accessing, Updating or Deleting Information Collected About You.</strong> This Site also gives you the opportunity to modify or remove Personal Information that you have provided to us by way of this Site. You may do so by modifying your password-protected registered user information on the Site. To the extent that such information is stored in our databases, we will respond to your changes as soon as reasonably possible, although please understand that although this information, once deleted, is not available on the Site, that information may remain stored indefinitely in our backup and archival records. To the extent that such information is not stored in our databases, we cannot always ensure that these corrections or deletions will reach such other databases in a timely manner.</li>
<li><strong> Where We Store Your Personal Information&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To make the Site available to you or to provide any services to you via the Site, we may share your Personal Information within the Roc Nation group of companies. If you are located in the EEA, this may involve transferring your Personal Information outside of the EEA. Many of our external third parties are based outside of the EEA so their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever we transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Information by the European Commission. For further details see here.</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give Personal Information the same protection it has in the EEA. For further details, see here.</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the USA, we may transfer Personal Information to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Information shared between the EEA and the USA. For further details, see here.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact us at <u>privacy@rocnation.com</u> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Security of Your Personal Information.</strong> Roc Nation employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for Personal Information collected through this Site, including physical, electronic and operational measures to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access. In addition, we limit access to your Personal Information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to use it. They will only process your Personal Information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. While Roc Nation takes all appropriate steps to safeguard Personal Information under our control, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of storing data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, we cannot guarantee that Personal Information supplied by users will not be accessed on our servers, or intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information during such transfers. If you have reason to believe that there has been any breach of the security of the Site, please contact us at privacy@rocnation.com.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the event of a Personal Information breach, we will notify you and any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong> Contacting Roc Nation Regarding this Site.</strong> If you have any questions concerning this Policy, you may send them by email to our Privacy Officer at privacy@rocnation.com. Please note that email communications will not necessarily be secure; accordingly you should not include credit card information or other sensitive information in your email correspondence with us. You must send any official correspondence via postal mail to:</li>

<li><strong> Access to Your Personal Information.</strong> We appreciate your assistance in keeping your Personal Information up to date and accurate. You are entitled to access, verify, amend and/or correct your Personal Information collected by Roc Nation. You are encouraged to contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@rocnation.com, or the above postal address to verify, correct or update your Personal Information. If you have a concern regarding the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information by Roc Nation, please contact our Privacy Officer.

<p><em>EEA residents only</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have any concerns about how we handle your Personal Information, please contact us in the first instance. We will do our best to resolve your concern. Alternatively, you may prefer to submit a complaint directly to your national supervisory authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA, you have a number of rights in relation to how we process your Personal Information. These include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the right access the Personal Information that we may hold about you;</li>
<li>the right to rectify any inaccurate Personal Information that we may hold about you;</li>
<li>the right to have your Personal Information erased in certain circumstances, for example, where it is no longer necessary for us to process your Personal Information to fulfil our processing purposes; or where you have exercised your right to object to the processing;</li>
<li>the right to restrict the processing of your Personal Information where, for example, the information is inaccurate or it is no longer necessary for us to process such information or where you have exercised your right to object to our processing;</li>
<li>the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information which may be exercised in certain circumstances, for example, where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, or where your own legitimate interests outweigh ours; and</li>
<li>the right to have your Personal Information ported to a new service provider if you no longer wish to use the Site or our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can exercise any of these rights any time by contacting us at privacy@rocnation.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>No fee usually required.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What we may need from you.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise your rights. This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Time limit to respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
