			<h2>ROCKSTAR WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy constitutes an integral part of the Terms &amp; 
Conditions that govern your use of the www.rockstar69.com website 
(“Site”), which is owned and operated by Rockstar, Inc. (“Rockstar”). 
This Privacy Policy also constitutes part of the terms and conditions 
(such as official rules) that govern your participation in any and all 
online and offline activities sponsored by Rockstar (each, a “Rockstar 
Sponsored Event”).
</p>
<p>
Rockstar respects your online privacy. This Privacy Policy informs you 
of what information we may collect from or about you on our Site, how we
 may use such information, and your rights and choices regarding our use
 of your information. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE 
USING OUR SITE. By using our Site or participating in a Rockstar 
Sponsored Event, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy,
 and agree to be bound by it. If you do not agree to any of the terms 
contained in this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using our Site or 
disclosing personal information on our Site or participating in any 
Rockstar Sponsored Event.
</p>
Notice to California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights
<p>
We may share customer information with non-affiliated parties so that 
they may offer, market and advertise products and services directly to 
our customers. Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, you 
may opt out of having your personal information shared with third 
parties at no charge by sending us an email at 
optout.nonaffiliate@rockstar69.com which must include your request, 
including your name, phone number, and email address. You may also 
request any information concerning you previously disclosed by Rockstar 
by sending an email to privacy@rockstar69.com which must include the 
same information. Please note that Rockstar is not required to respond 
to such requests regarding disclosed information more than once in a 
calendar year, nor are we required to respond to any request which is 
not sent to the email address designated above. 
</p>
<h4>1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
<p>
(a) Personal Information. This refers to your personally identifiable 
information, which may include your first and last name, telephone 
number, email address, mailing address, and Payment Account Information 
(as defined below). Many areas and features on our Site do not require 
registration and may be accessed by you without having to disclose any 
Personal Information. However, to the extent you voluntarily provide 
your Personal Information to us, we collect such information. For 
example, we collect Personal Information from you: (i) when you register
 to become a member on our Site; (ii) when you register to participate 
in a Rockstar Sponsored Event; (iii) when you join our electronic 
mailing list; (iv) when you purchase a product from us online (in such 
event we collect your credit card or other payment account information 
(“Payment Account Information”) in order for us to accept, process, 
manage and fulfill a purchase order as well as to process a return and 
refund request from you after the purchase); and/or (v) when you submit a
 request or inquiry to us on our Site (each of the foregoing is referred
 to hereinafter as a “Transaction or Request”). Whether or not to 
disclose Personal Information is completely your choice. However, 
without your information, we will not be able to process your 
Transaction or Request.
</p>
<p>
(b) Aggregate and Anonymous Information. This refers to any information 
that does not identify you individually. For example, we collect 
aggregate various traffic data regarding our Site. We may also combine 
“User Activity Information” (as described below) about you and other 
users of our Site to generate aggregate information that reflects 
activities, habits, preferences, interests, etc. about our users as a 
group. In addition, we may take Personal Information and make it 
non-personally identifiable, such as by aggregating your information 
with information about other individuals, or by removing 
personally-identifiable elements (such as names) so as to anonymize your
 information.
</p>
<p>
(c) User Activity Information. This refers to information we collect 
about user activities on our Site. For example, our Site servers 
automatically collect and log clickstream data for all visitors to our 
Site, such as IP addresses, page requests, pages visited, content 
viewed, clicks and search queries made, etc. We also use cookies and web
 beacons to collect user activity information on our Site. 
</p>
<p>
To the extent we use User Activity Information in a manner that 
identifies a specific user individually, it will be treated as Personal 
Information. Otherwise, User Activity Information will be treated as 
Aggregate and Anonymous Information.
</p>
<h4>2. OUR USE OF INFORMATION</h4>
<p>
Rockstar uses information collected from and/or about our users and 
customers to improve our products and services, to improve the pages and
 content of our Site, to administer and maintain operations of our Site,
 to administer and manage transactions and relationships with our users 
and customers, to offer, market and advertise products and services to 
our users and customers, and to conduct market research and analysis.
</p>
<p>
(a) For Transactional, Administrative, and Customer Relations Purposes. 
If you provide Personal Information to us in connection with a 
Transaction or Request, we will use your information to process, 
administer, manage, and communicate with you regarding such Transaction 
or Request. If you provide your email address or mailing address to us, 
we may use such address to send you notices of a transactional, 
administrative or customer relationship nature or as required by law, 
such as notice of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the 
Terms and Conditions for our Site, notice of an actual security breach 
that affects your Personal Information stored by or for us, etc.
</p>
<p>
(b) For Marketing and Advertising Purposes. We may use your Personal 
Information and/or User Activity Information to offer, market and 
advertise to you, on our Site and/or via email, our and/or third-party 
products and services that may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
(c) For Market Research Purposes. We may use Aggregate and Anonymous 
Information (including such information derived from Personal 
Information and User Activity Information) to conduct market research 
and analysis for ourselves as well as for our sponsors and business 
partners.
</p>
<h4>3. DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES OUTSIDE ROCKSTAR</h4>
<p>
(a) Disclosure to Non-Affiliates for Direct Marketing/Advertising 
Purposes. We do not, but may in the future, share your Personal 
Information with non-affiliated third parties so that they may offer, 
market and advertise products and services directly to you. If and when 
that happens, we will provide our customers with advance notice and the 
choice to opt out of such information sharing.
</p>
Please note, however, that under no circumstances do we knowingly share 
your Payment Account Information with non-affiliated third parties for 
direct marketing and advertising purposes (except with your prior 
consent).

<p>
(b) Disclosure to Co-Sponsors. From time to time, we may co-sponsor 
(online and offline) events and/or product/service offerings with 
non-affiliated third parties. If you participate in such co-sponsored 
events or offerings, any Personal Information and User Activity 
Information we collect from you based on your participation may be 
shared with our co-sponsors who may use such information for their own 
marketing and advertising purposes. You must contact our co-sponsors 
directly in order to opt out of their use of your information for 
marketing and advertising purposes.
</p><p>
(c) Disclosure to Service Providers. We may disclose your Personal 
Information and User Activity Information to our outside vendors and 
contractors who need to access such information in order to perform 
their services (including, without limitation, transaction/payment 
processing, order fulfillment, survey/contest/sweepstakes administration
 and prize fulfillment, data research and analysis, data collection and 
processing, data storage, data security, hosting and technical support 
for our Site, and marketing and advertising support) to us 
(collectively, “Service Providers”). We generally require that our 
Service Providers use your information shared by us solely for the 
purposes of performing their services to us and that they maintain the 
confidentiality, security and integrity of such information and not 
further disclose the information to others.
</p>
<p>
(d) Disclosure Under Other Circumstances. We may disclose your Personal 
Information and User Activity Information to others if doing so is 
required by law, or in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to
 comply with any legal process, law enforcement, to enforce this Privacy
 Policy, respond to an emergency, or protect the rights, property or 
safety of Rockstar, and/or the public.
</p>
<p>
(e) Unrestricted Disclosure of Aggregate and Anonymous Information. 
Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of such 
information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how 
we may use or disclose such information. For example, we may freely 
share such information with non-affiliated third parties who may use 
such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other 
business purposes. We may also freely share such information with our 
Service Providers in order for them to perform services for us. 
</p>
<h4>4. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE: YOUR CHOICES</h4>
<p>
(a) Opt-Out for Email Marketing. When you register to become a member on
 our Site or to participate in a Rockstar Sponsored Event, we may 
provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving marketing 
emails from us at that time. Even if you do not exercise the opt-out 
choice when you disclose your Personal Information to Rockstar, you may 
subsequently exercise such choice at any time, by sending your request 
to us via email at optout.marketing@rockstar69.com, or by using the 
“Unsubscribe” link provided in a marketing email you may have previously
 received from us. Please note, however, that your opt-out will apply 
only to marketing and promotional emails from us and will not stop email
 communications from us relating to your Transaction or Request, such as
 notice of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms and
 Conditions for our Site, notice of an actual or suspected security 
breach that affects your Personal Information stored by or for us, etc.
</p>
<p>
Please also note that if the email address you provide to us is a 
“wireless” email address (i.e. the address is designated by a wireless 
service carrier specifically for transmitting emails to a wireless 
device), we will not send marketing emails to that address without your 
prior opt-in consent. The FCC has established a list of domain names 
used by wireless service providers to transmit emails to wireless 
devices at http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/DomainNameDownload.html. 
Wireless service providers must add new domain names to this list within
 30 days of activating them. If your email address contains a domain 
name on this list (after the “@” symbol), then we will treat your email 
address as a wireless email address. However, the mere fact that you can
 retrieve emails from your regular Internet email account on your 
mobile/wireless device does not make your Internet email address a 
“wireless” email address.(b) Opt-Out for Disclosure to Non-Affiliates 
for Direct Marketing/Advertising Purposes. We do not currently, but may 
in the future, share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third
 parties so that they may offer, market and advertise products and 
services directly to you. You may at any time opt out of such 
information sharing, by sending your request to us via email at 
optout.nonaffiliate@rockstar69.com. We may also provide you with an 
opportunity to opt out at the time you register for a Rockstar Sponsored
 Event, such as by checking an opt-out box on the registration page.
</p>
<h4>5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
<p>
Rockstar understands the importance of protecting the security and 
integrity of personal information that our customers have shared with 
us, and will endeavor to safeguard your Personal Information. All 
Payment Account Information provided by you in connection with an online
 transaction with our Site will be protected by encryption using the 
standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, and we retain your Payment
 Account Information for only as long as is necessary to process your 
membership and other related transactions with us. It is also important 
for you to protect against unauthorized access to any passwords and to 
your computer. We will attempt to notify you in the event we become 
aware of a breach or suspected breach of the security of your Personal 
Information stored by us.
</p>
<p>
While Rockstar will attempt to safeguard your Personal Information, it 
cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. You 
understand and agree that Rockstar shall not be liable for any breach of
 the security of your Personal Information resulting from causes or 
events that are beyond Rockstar’s control, including, without 
limitation, your own act or omission, corruption of storage media, 
defects in third-party data security products or services, power 
failures, natural phenomena, riots, acts of vandalism, hacking, 
sabotage, or terrorism. Please note that any information that you post 
in any public, community or interactive areas on our Site (e.g. chat 
rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, and discussion groups) will be 
accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result 
in unsolicited or unwanted messages or contact from others.
</p>
<h4>6. USE OF COOKIES </h4>
<p>
We may send cookies, which are small pieces of data, to your web browser
 to facilitate your use of the Site. Cookies help us deliver content 
specific to your interests and permit our servers to recall information 
from your prior to visits to our Site. We may use information collected 
from cookies together with Personal Information we have collected from 
you. We do not use cookies to access information on your computer or 
device. You can choose whether to accept cookies by adjusting the 
settings of your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, you 
may still enter our Site, but you may not have full access to all areas 
within our Site. 
</p>
<h4>7. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h4>
