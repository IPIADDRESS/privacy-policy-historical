These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the RockYou Sites. These third-parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p><br> 
                                     
                                    <p style="color:black;">RockYou does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks RockYou to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.</p><br> 
                                     
                                    <p style="color:black;">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The RockYou Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p><br>

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to RockYou and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, RockYou makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><br>

RockYou may post a notice on the RockYou Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

For that reason, RockYou does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the RockYou Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the RockYou Sites at any time or in any manner. If RockYou learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the RockYou Sites then RockYou will take the appropriate steps to delete this information immediately.</p><br> 
                                     
                                    <p style="color:black;">We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents or guardians for permission before sending any personal information to anyone over the Internet.</p><br>
