Sites.  RockYou! provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the RockYou! Sites. 
</p><p>

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the RockYou! Terms of Use. Your use of the RockYou! Sites and any personal information you provide on the RockYou! Sites remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 
</p><p>

Please note that any image, video, or other content posted at the direction of Users onto the RockYou! Sites becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy. 
</p><p>

The Information RockYou! Collects:<br> 

User Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) to RockYou! when choosing to participate in various activities on the RockYou! Sites such as uploading images and captions, uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists. 
</p><p>

Cookies Information: When you visit the RockYou! Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  RockYou! uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.

</p><p>

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.

</p><p>

We may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major RockYou! Site changes, new messages in your inbox, or for customer service purposes). We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the RockYou! Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

</p><p>

When RockYou! Discloses Information:<br> 

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
</p><p>

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou! Sites.  RockYou! May share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou! or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.
</p><p>

We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 
</p><p>

It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.
</p><p>

RockYou! also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that RockYou! believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou!

Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:<br> 

RockYou! allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the RockYou! Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the RockYou! Sites.
