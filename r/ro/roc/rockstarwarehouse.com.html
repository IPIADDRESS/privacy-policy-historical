      <li>Data where certain identifiers are removed to prevent a person's identity from being directly connected with the information (such as masking certain personal identifiers) <strong>("De-identified Data")</strong>.</li>

      <li>Information that can be used to identify you, either alone or in combination with other information available to us, such as your name, shipping and billing address, e-mail address, phone number, identification number (where applicable), date of birth (where applicable), time and location data, bank account information, transaction and payment records, delivery records and other information associated with your account, which is collected by us during delivery of our commerce solution ("<strong>Personal Data</strong>").</li>
