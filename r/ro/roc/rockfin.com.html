        information from you, we want you to know how it is used. To demonstrate
        our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading
        industry privacy guidelines.

    <p>
        Because of the financial nature of our business, our websites are not

        At Quicken Loans, we want you to be comfortable and confident when using
        our website. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following
        principles that govern our information practices and other privacy
        aspects of our website:
    </p>

    <p>
        We do not make our advertising decisions based on political affiliations
        or in support of, or against, any political or religious group. We firmly
        believe in the right of free speech, however, we also believe we have an
        obligation to ensure our advertising does not appear in content that is
        detrimental to our brand values. As one of our “ISMs” states, we “Do the
        Right Thing” when deciding where our advertising messages will appear.
        This means we will not advertise within programs that consistently
        exploit excessive or gratuitous violence or sexuality, which demean or
        denigrate any religion, race, sex or which are otherwise lacking in good taste.
    </p>

    <p>
        Should our advertising appear within programming content that violates
        these guidelines we will review the content in question and make decisions
        about the appropriateness of that program for future consideration.

    <h2>
        PROTECTING YOUR IDENTITY AND CREDIT
    </h2>
    <p>
        Credit reporting agencies may share your information with other companies
        when you apply for a home loan. This may cause you to receive Email or
        phone calls that you didn't ask for, offering credit cards, refinancing
        or other loan products.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can stop these calls and Emails by opting out of these prescreened
        credit offers. Simply call (888) 567-8688 or visit

    <ul class="list__y list__y--bullets">
        <li>
            <strong>Tools, Applications and Registration:</strong> We provide a
            number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and
            loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable
            for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and
            other interactive advisors, such as the online interviews, without
            providing us your identity. We will not ask you for personally
            identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute
            the information that you provide to you as an individual.
            <p>
                However, if you want to exercise one or more of the loan options
                presented, we will ask you to register at the site and supply
                other identifying and supporting information needed to process
                your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                By registering, you can save information such as loan interviews
                and applications for later review and update. When you register,
                you select a member ID name by which we will know you, choose a
                password and provide us an Email address. You use the member ID
                name and password to gain access to your loan application information,
                financial profile and/or customized rates. We use your contact
                information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding your
                loan status, which is part of the Quicken Loans service. Quicken
                Loans does not share your information with outside companies for
                their promotional use. We may, however, use it to send you
                communications and special offers on other products or services
                offered by Quicken Loans. If you do not want to receive this
                information you may opt-out during registration, within any future
                communications or by sending an Email to
                <a href="mailto:optout@QuickenLoans.com">optout@QuickenLoans.com</a>.

            Loans uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, a powerful
            encryption commercially available for Internet products. (However,
            be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption
            level, while secure, is not the highest level available. United
            States and Canadian citizens can download free 128-bit browsers
            from <a class="window_open" href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>,

                We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on
                the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard
                computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully
                developed security procedures and practices. All employees must
                review and sign a written statement of these practices which include
                limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees
                who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols
                for all employees. In addition, a username, member ID name and
                password are required for you to use, view or change application
                or interview information. We use both internal and external
                resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.

        WE TELL YOU HOW AND WHY WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our websites:
    </p>
    <ul class="list__y list__y--bullets">
        <li>
                <strong>Cookies:</strong> A "cookie" is a small piece of information
                that our website may provide to your browser while you are at our
                sites. The Quicken Loans website supplies your browser with cookies
                that contain a unique identifier used to better understand website
                usage in the aggregate and on an individual level so we know what
                areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of
                visits to those areas). This is done through a tracking utility
                that allows us, for example, to reconstruct activity from a
                session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution
                purposes. Quicken Loans may also employ service providers to
                help us collect and understand our website usage data.
            <p>
                When periodic surveys are presented to website visitors, cookies
                are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the same individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a registered member on the Quicken Loans website,
                you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained
                by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also
                used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access
                to areas of our website that are limited to registered members,
                such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Quicken Loans service providers that serve ads on
                affiliate and/or advertiser websites may assign different cookies
                and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons,
                to your browser to track the effectiveness of Quicken Loans
                advertising on other websites and your involvement with Quicken
                Loans. For example, as part of the Quicken Loans affiliate programs,
                our service providers use cookies and web beacons to determine
                when affiliate program members have referred a customer to Quicken
                Loans via a link on their website. The Quicken Loans website also
                sets a temporary cookie that contains a unique, anonymous identifier
                that is provided to the service provider to ensure that each referral
                is only counted once. This cookie is not linked to a customer's personal
                information. The cookies and web beacons are necessary to ensure
                that affiliate program members are appropriately credited for their
                referrals. Service providers report data in the aggregate and do
                not link it to individual customer information. Quicken Loans may
                also employ service providers who may assign cookies or web beacons
                to your browser to assist us in collecting website usage data such
                as your IP address, session ID, URL and demographic information
                such as your zip code. The collection of data may include personally
                identifiable information. We do not track URLs that you type into
                your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site.
                Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and sign in to
                special areas of the website and you have modified your browser settings not
                to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies
                that we send. Otherwise, you won't be able to participate in certain areas of
                the website. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to remove cookies provided by Quicken Loans, from your browser,
                you may learn how to do so by
                <a href="/about/legal/delete-browser-cookies">clicking here</a>.
                Since most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies,
                you will most likely have to set your browser to reject new cookies
                or to disable them altogether, in order to avoid receiving future
                cookies from the Quicken Loans website. Please note that if you
                choose to reject or disable cookies, your access to certain areas
                within the Quicken Loans website may be limited.

                <strong>Behavioral Advertising:</strong> Please be aware that we use
                third party advertising companies to collect non-personally
                identifiable information for online behavioral advertising to provide
                targeted display advertisements, likely to be of greater interest
                to you, through participating publishers and advertisers. Such
                information may include non-personally identifiable information
                (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date,
                subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) through the
                use of Cookies and other technology. To learn more about online

            <strong>Website Usage Data:</strong> Our website tracks usage data,
            including, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version,
            which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you to our site, and
            which link, if any, you follow off of our site. We use this data in
            the aggregate and on an individual level to better understand website
            activity to improve our site offerings, to reconstruct activity from a
            session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes.
            We may also use this data to provide you a more personalized website
            experience, assistance with technical support questions, and to send
            you special offers, product and service updates, or other promotional
            materials that are relevant and tailored to your interests. If you do
            not want to receive these offers or promotions, simply indicate your
            contact preferences during the registration process, within any future
            communications or by sending an Email to
