<p><i>The Way RockYou Uses Information</i></p><br>

<p>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the RockYou Sites, then we use your personal information to create your account and operate, maintain, and provide you the features and functionality of the RockYou Sites.</p><br>

<p>Receiving our newsletter is offered as part of our service. If you do not wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each newsletter or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@rockyou.com">support@rockyou.com</a>.</p><br>

<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited messages. RockYou is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these public areas of the site.

<p>We may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major RockYou Site changes, new messages in your inbox, or for customer service purposes). We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the RockYou Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</p><br>

<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) retain information so that you will not be required to re-enter it during your visits to the RockYou Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics, including total number of visitors and traffic; (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests; (f) diagnose or fix technical problems reported by Users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (g) access your information after you sign in.</p><br>

<p><i>When RockYou Discloses Information</i></p><br>

<p>RockYou will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.</p><br>

<p>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information.</p><br>

<p>We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment.  The third party then provides RockYou the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction.</p><br>

<p>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RockYou Site. RockYou may share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through RockYou or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.</p><br>

<p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p><br>

<p>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p><br>

<p>RockYou also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that RockYou believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the RockYou Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of RockYou, our Users or others.</p><br>

<p><i>Your Choices</i></p><br>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the RockYou Sites, in which case RockYou may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the RockYou Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.</p><br>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p><br>

<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p><br>
