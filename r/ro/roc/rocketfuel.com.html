<p><strong>ROCKET FUEL PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Section I covers our policies regarding our collection, use, and sharing of data through our digital advertising services and instructions for opting out of interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Section II covers our policies regarding collection, use and sharing of data provided by visitors to our corporate website.</p>
<p>Section III covers our Privacy Shield certification.</p>
<p><strong>Section I â Rocket Fuel Advertising Services</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Consumer Mission</strong></p>
<p>At Rocket Fuel, we want digital advertising to be a useful complement to your online experience. We want to deliver personalized, well-chosen ads to help you discover things that interest youânew websites, new products, new bargains.</p>
<p>We are the ârocket fuelâ for the web that powers this discovery. We use complex technology to pick the best ads to show, based on everything we know about the context: the ad itself, the page that needs an ad, the time of day and other external factors, and information from your browser or mobile device digital advertising identifier that we use to predict what advertising would be most relevant and interesting to you.</p>
<p>If we can make ads more useful and interesting for you, then weâll also make advertising more valuable to advertisers, and your visits will make websites more money per ad, and power their investments in the websites, apps, online features and content that they provide to you for free. Fueling ad supported free content and services is an endeavor that we are proud to be a part of, and we hope youâre equally happy with the results. But if youâre not, you may learn more about opting out of personalized advertisements in the section below under âOpting Out of Personalized Advertisements.â</p>
<p><strong>How We Think of You</strong></p>
<p>Before describing the kinds of data we collect, itâs important to understand how we think of you and other web surfers and online consumers. We do not know you personally, and we do not need to in order to provide you with relevant advertising. We may place an anonymous identifier in a cookie on your web browser or use an anonymous advertising ID associated with your mobile device. So to us you, and anyone else that uses that browser or mobile device, are just âsurfer82â for example. Our cookies are called ârfihubâ which stands for Rocket Fuel Inc. hub, our server, and you can find them if you search for cookies in your browser settings.</p>
<p>We donât request or store personally-identifiable information (PII) that can be used to identify you directly, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. We also prohibit our partners and customers from sharing this information with us.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about âyouâ in this privacy policy, we are referring to information that is associated with one or more anonymous identifiers associated with a web browser (such as Google Chrome or Firefox) that you might use, or with an anonymous advertising ID associated with a mobile device.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect </strong></p>
<p>When you visit one of our advertiserâs websites or mobile applications (âappsâ), or the websites or apps where we display advertisements, we may collect information about your activity on that site (such as the page viewed or the advertising that you clicked on) or the location of your device, in order to show you relevant advertising. We may collect information about your device, such as the IP address, unique device identifier, browser type and language, the server your computer is logged into, and the operating system information. To learn about the ads you might like or dislike, we may also ask you questions directlyâfor example, we may provide a survey that asks about which ads, products, or brands you like or dislike. We may collect information about our interactions with you, such as which ads weâve shown, and on which pages, and whether you responded to those ads by interacting with them. We may collect information about our partnersâ interactions with youâfor example, by placing pixels on an advertiserâs web page that let us know if you ultimately purchased an item after we ran an advertising campaign that showed you an ad. We store this information associated with an anonymous identifier in a profile in our database. We may partner with other companies that also use anonymous identifiers to share anonymous information with us in order to enhance these profiles. For example, we may partner with other companies to learn the kinds of products you like to buy online.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention and Security</strong></p>
<p>Rocket Fuel deletes user profiles in our database after 90 days of inactivity. This means that if we have not received an opportunity to show a consumer an ad, observed a visit from a consumer to a website that includes a Rocket Fuel pixel, or received new information from one of our partners about a consumer, we will delete the user ID associated with that consumer.</p>
<p>The cookies Rocket Fuel places on consumersâ devices also automatically expire 13 months after they are written.</p>
<p>Other data that we compile, which is used for purposes like reporting, attribution and fraud detection, may be retained for up to 30 months.</p>
<p>We use physical, administrative, and industry standard technical safeguards that are designed to protect the information that we collect and maintain.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Information</strong></p>
<p>We use the information that we collect directly or receive from other companies to find patterns that help us select better ads to serve you at any given moment. For example, we might learn that an ad for mp3 downloads is attractive to people whoâve previously clicked ads for mp3 players, or we might learn that a coffee ad works better in the morning. Our technology can test millions of possibilities along these lines and build giant models to predict responses to advertising.</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel sometimes matches its anonymous identifiers with our partnersâ anonymous identifiers through a process called âcookie matchingâ. The âcookie matchingâ process synchronizes two IDs belonging to different companies in a way that makes it easier to serve advertising online, without the need to share other pieces of information about the ID.</p>
<p>We make inferences from the data we collect, or match with others, in order to show you advertisements for products or services that we think may interest you. As an example, we may use health-related segments such as âFrequent Buyers &gt; Health &amp; Wellness Buyersâ (<a href="http://rocketfuel.com/downloads/Rocket%20Fuel%20Health%20Segments.pdf">Click here</a> for a complete health segment list.) However, at no point does Rocket Fuel collect identifying personal information such as your name or address from these third parties.</p>
<p>We also use the information we collect to measure the effectiveness of ads on behalf of our advertisers and publishers.</p>
<p>We may also predict whether different anonymous identifiers associated with different browsers and different devices, like a laptop, a phone or a tablet, may belong to one person, and then link the activity we see across those devices into a common profile. We call this a âcross device graphâ. We believe this helps us serve you better advertisements, control how many times you may see the same advertisement, and provide better service to our advertisers. We make these predictions based on the anonymous information and deidentified information that we may receive from our third party partners, that you may have provided personal information to. However, we do not collect, use or store personally identifiable information that directly identifies you (for example, your account information with a service provider) when we create these cross-device graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We produce reports and analytics for our business partners regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns and regarding the characteristics of people that were responsive to their advertising campaigns. However, we do not share specific online profiles that our technology uses to select advertisements to deliver to you. We may share the information we collect when we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or legal processes or respond to lawful requests, including responding to subpoenas, warrants or court orders. Finally, we may transfer information to a successor or assignee in connection with a corporate change in control such as a merger or acquisition or other transaction.</p>
<h2><strong>Opting Out of Personalized Advertisements</strong></h2>
<p>You can click <a class="optout_trigger" href="#">here</a> to opt out of personalized ads based on the Rocket Fuel cookie. If you opt out of interest-based advertising from Rocket Fuel, then we will opt you out of interest based advertising for all the identifiers or devices that we have associated with you at the time of the opt out request. We use a predictive process to associate identifiers and devices and we do not know definitively all devices or browsers that you may use.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to opt out of interest based advertising services from us on multiple devices and browsers, then we recommend that you use this opt out process for each device and browser.</p>
<p>We acquired online advertising company, X Plus One Solutions, Inc. or [x+1]. If you visited this page to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from [x+1], you may do so by clicking <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel and [x+1] are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), so you may also opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from Rocket Fuel, [x+1], or other NAI member companies via the NAI opt-out page <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel and [x+1] also comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA). You may opt out of receiving personalized advertisements by DAA members via the DAA website <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">here</a> and EDAA members <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com">here</a> .</p>
<p>Rocket Fuel is integrated with the DAAâs AppChoices, which allows consumers to download and manage their privacy preferences in a mobile environment. You may download DAAâs AppChoices mobile app on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of application activity for interest-based advertising. Links to those applications are below:</p>

</ul>
<p>An opt-out in any of the tools listed here will have the same effect, and you do not need to make an opt out selection using more than one method. If you opt out of interest based advertising, youâll still see ads from us online, but they may not be tailored to your interests. Note that weâll still maintain a cookie on your computer to note the fact that youâve opted out. That opt-out cookie is associated with a particular computer and browser. So, for example, if you get a new computer, install a new browser, or clear your cookies, youâll need to opt-out again if you still do not want interest based advertising. Unlike other cookies that automatically expire after 13 months, our opt out cookies never expire. If you change your mind, click <a class="optin_trigger" href="#">here</a> to opt back in.</p>
