				<p><strong>Date of Last Revision: 2016-09-09.</strong></p>
<p>RocketJump, Inc. (“RocketJump”), and its affiliates operate this website (the “Site”) and the<br>
services related to or offered on the Site (hereinafter, the<br>
“Services”). RocketJump’s Services may include, without limitation, tools, applications, email<br>
services, bulletin and message boards, chat areas, news<br>
groups, forums, communities, calendars, and downloadable mobile applications related to the Site<br>
or provided through the Site.</p>
<p>RocketJump provides you this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to help you understand the kinds of<br>
information RocketJump may gather about you when you visit<br>
the Site or use any of RocketJump’s Services, and how RocketJump may collect, use and disclose<br>
the information.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase “Personal Information” in this Policy means information that identifies a<br>
specific person such as a person’s full name, address,<br>
e-mail address. The phrase “Anonymous Information” in this Policy means non-personal information<br>
that cannot reasonably be used to identify individual<br>
persons (<em>e.g.</em>, interests, demographics and anonymous usage data).</p>
<p>By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices<br>
described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the<br>
Services, you agree and expressly consent to RocketJump’s collection, use and disclosure of the<br>
information that you provide as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will be processed by RocketJump in the United States.</p>
<p>In addition to this general Policy, each Service may have additional privacy provisions that are<br>
specific to the particular Service. These supplemental<br>
disclosures are made adjacent to the particular Service at the time RocketJump collects the<br>
information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the<br>
use of your information.</p>
<p>In general you can use the Site and/or Service without telling RocketJump who you are or<br>
revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, if<br>
you do not provide RocketJump with certain requested information, we may not be able to provide<br>
you with certain services and features that may be<br>
contained on the Site and/or Service.</p>
<h3>1. INFORMATION GATHERED BY RocketJump</h3>
<p>RocketJump collects information about you in the following ways:</p>
<h4><u>A. Information you voluntarily provide RocketJump.</u></h4>
<p>RocketJump collects and maintains information that you voluntarily submit to RocketJump during<br>
your use of the Site and Services. For example:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>When you register for the Site, certain provided information to RocketJump will be required<br>
such as your name and email address;</li>
<li>When you post comments and/or content on the Site and/or Service information about you that<br>
accompanies those posts or content, which may include a<br>
name, user name, likes, status, profile information and/or picture. This information is always<br>
public, which means it is available to everyone and may<br>
be displayed in search results on external search engines.</li>
<li>If you sign up to enter a contest or sweepstakes or receive a newsletter, if any, you may<br>
provide RocketJump contact information (e.g., email or<br>
physical address);</li>
<li>If you access or log-in to the Site and/or Services through a social media or other service or<br>
connect the Site and/or Services to a social media or<br>
other service, the information RocketJump collects may also include your user ID and/or user<br>
name associated with that social media service, any<br>
information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with RocketJump,<br>
such as your profile picture, email address or friends<br>
lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.<br>
When you access the Site and/or Services through social<br>
media services or when you connect the Site and/or Service to social media services, you are<br>
authorizing RocketJump to collect, store, and use such<br>
information and in accordance with this Policy;</li>
<li>If you purchase a product or service, you may provide RocketJump your credit card<br>
information; and</li>
<li>You may provide RocketJump with Personal Information in the course of email, customer support<br>
interactions and surveys.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>B. Information RocketJump collects through your use of the Site.</u></h4>
<p>As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through<br>
cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies,<br>
RocketJump may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example<br>
RocketJump may determine through an IP address that a<br>
particular computer or device is located in Los Angeles and RocketJump may use this information<br>
to deliver advertisements promoting Los Angeles-based<br>
businesses. This information allows RocketJump to deliver more helpful information, programs,<br>
tools and advertisements.</p>
<p>Information RocketJump may also combine online and/or offline information received from third<br>
parties (“Third Parties”) with the information RocketJump<br>
has already collected from you via RocketJump’s Site and/or Services. The third party<br>
information is used for a variety of purposes including verifying<br>
other information about you and to enhance the content and advertising RocketJump provides to<br>
you.</p>
<p>RocketJump and Third Parties may customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the<br>
information that you provide RocketJump; (ii) data Rocket<br>
Jump receives from third parties; or (iii) your visits on the Site or use of Services and other<br>
websites or services (commonly referred to as “Behavioral<br>
Advertising”). Please see the “Cookies and Targeted Advertising” section below for more<br>
information on the use of tracking technologies and the information<br>
collected for Behavioral Advertising, and how you can delete cookies.</p>
<h3>2. HOW ROCKETJUMP USES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p>RocketJump may use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the<br>
time that the information is collected.</p>
<p>In general, RocketJump and Third Parties use your Personal Information as necessary or<br>
appropriate for purposes including, but not limited, to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>administer your account;</li>
<li>register you and provide you access to the Site and/or Services;</li>
<li>respond to inquiries or requests in connection with the Site;</li>
<li>fulfill your requests for products or services;</li>
<li>send communications and administrative emails about the Site and/or Services;</li>
<li>personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Site and Services<br>
for your use;</li>
<li>send you Site and/or Service-related communications, including any notices required by law, in<br>
lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt<br>
out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
<li>send you newsletters and other messages, including changes to features of the Site and/or<br>
Service and special offers that you may opt out of by<br>
clicking “unsubscribe” in the email and/or by editing your preferences on your <a href="https://accounts.rocketjump.com">dashboard</a> page<br>
on the Site. Opting out may prevent you from receiving<br>
email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</li>
<li>send you promotional/marketing information, offers or other information regarding<br>
opportunities and functionality that RocketJump thinks would be of<br>
particular interest to you;</li>
<li>improve the quality of the Site and the Services; and</li>
<li>analyze, benchmark and conduct research on user data and user interactions with the Site and<br>
Services.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. COOKIES AND TARGETED ADVERTISING</h3>
<h4><u>A. Tracking Technologies (e.g., Cookies)</u></h4>
<p>RocketJump and/or Third Parties may use tacking technologies to provide you with a more<br>
personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services.<br>
These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the<br>
Services, such as pages you have visited, the video and other<br>
content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. For<br>
contests or sweepstakes, if any, RocketJump may also use<br>
cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls,<br>
RocketJump may use cookies to help ensure that an<br>
individual can’t vote more than once on a particular question or issue. RocketJump does not<br>
store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.</p>
<p>Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser’s directions within the help tab. In<br>
order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your<br>
web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site or<br>
Service may not work properly, and you may not be able to<br>
access the Site and/or Services.</p>
<p>RocketJump may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent<br>
graphic images), operating system and device information and<br>
navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date<br>
and time of your visit, the features and information for<br>
which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked.</p>
<p>An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to<br>
your computer when you use the Internet. RocketJump, its<br>
partners or their respective service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site<br>
or Services or use other means to assist with delivering<br>
geographically targeted advertisements.</p>
<h4><u>B. Targeted Advertising</u></h4>
<p>RocketJump works with third party companies (<em>e.g.</em>, ad networks) that may use cookies<br>
for purposes including, without limitation, understanding<br>
Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Site, controlling the sequence of<br>
advertisements you see, making sure you don’t see the same<br>
advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and<br>
promotions based on those interests. The advertisement may appear<br>
when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the<br>
Internet if the website also has a relationship with<br>
RocketJump’s vendor. You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Site by clicking<br>
http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and opting-out of cookies<br>
placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the<br>
advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you<br>
change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your<br>
opt-out.</p>
<p>RocketJump adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the<br>
Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click<br>
here at http://www.aboutads.info/consumers).</p>
<p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use<br>
cookies and web beacons in the manner described above.<br>
RocketJump does not control these advertisers or other parties’ use of cookies or web beacons<br>
or what they do with the information they collect. Many<br>
third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising<br>
Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance<br>
(DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in<br>
advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn<br>
more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI OPT-OUT website<br>
(http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA CHOICE PAGE<br>
(http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will<br>
still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as<br>
relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your<br>
cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>
