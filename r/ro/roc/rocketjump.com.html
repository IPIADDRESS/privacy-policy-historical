<div> fob.la, and its affiliates operate this website (the “Site”) and the services related to or offered on the Site (hereinafter, the “Services”). RocketJump’s Services may include, without limitation, tools, applications, email services, bulletin and message boards, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, calendars, and downloadable mobile applications related to the Site or provided through the Site. </div>
<div> RocketJump provides you this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to help you understand the kinds of information RocketJump may gather about you when you visit the Site or use any of RocketJump’s Services, and how RocketJump may collect, use and disclose the information. </div>
<div> The use of the phrase “Personal Information” in this Policy means information that identifies a specific person such as a person’s full name, address, e-mail address. The phrase “Anonymous Information” in this Policy means non-personal information that cannot reasonably be used to identify individual persons (<em>e.g.</em>, interests, demographics and anonymous usage data). </div>
<div> By visiting this Site or using the Services, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Policy. Each time you visit the Site or use the Services, you agree and expressly consent to RocketJump’s collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy. </div>
<div> Your Personal Information will be processed by RocketJump in the United States. </div>
<div> In addition to this general Policy, each Service may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular Service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular Service at the time RocketJump collects the information. These supplemental disclosures also govern the use of your information. </div>
<div> In general you can use the Site and/or Service without telling RocketJump who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, if you do not provide RocketJump with certain requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services and features that may be contained on the Site and/or Service. </div>
<div>
<h3>1. INFORMATION GATHERED BY RocketJump</h3>
<p> RocketJump collects information about you in the following ways: </p>
<h4><u>A. Information you voluntarily provide RocketJump.</u></h4>
<p> RocketJump collects and maintains information that you voluntarily submit to RocketJump during your use of the Site and Services. For example: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>When you register for the Site, certain provided information to RocketJump will be required such as your name and email address;</li>
<li>When you post comments and/or content on the Site and/or Service information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, likes, status, profile information and/or picture. This information is always public, which means it is available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.</li>
<li>If you sign up to enter a contest or sweepstakes or receive a newsletter, if any, you may provide RocketJump contact information (e.g., email or physical address);</li>
<li>If you access or log-in to the Site and/or Services through a social media or other service or connect the Site and/or Services to a social media or other service, the information RocketJump collects may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with RocketJump, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Site and/or Services through social media services or when you connect the Site and/or Service to social media services, you are authorizing RocketJump to collect, store, and use such information and in accordance with this Policy;</li>
<li>If you purchase a product or service, you may provide RocketJump your credit card information; and</li>
<li>You may provide RocketJump with Personal Information in the course of email, customer support interactions and surveys.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>B. Information RocketJump collects through your use of the Site.</u></h4>
<p> As you use the Site and Services, certain information may also be passively collected. Through cookies, pixels, beacons, log files and other technologies, RocketJump may collect information about how you use the Site and the Services. For example RocketJump may determine through an IP address that a particular computer or device is located in Los Angeles and RocketJump may use this information to deliver advertisements promoting Los Angeles-based businesses. This information allows RocketJump to deliver more helpful information, programs, tools and advertisements. </p></div>
<div> Information RocketJump may also combine online and/or offline information received from third parties (“Third Parties”) with the information RocketJump has already collected from you via RocketJump’s Site and/or Services. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including verifying other information about you and to enhance the content and advertising RocketJump provides to you. </div>
<div> RocketJump and Third Parties may customize the advertisements that you see based upon: (i) the information that you provide RocketJump; (ii) data Rocket Jump receives from third parties; or (iii) your visits on the Site or use of Services and other websites or services (commonly referred to as “Behavioral Advertising”). Please see the “Cookies and Targeted Advertising” section below for more information on the use of tracking technologies and the information collected for Behavioral Advertising, and how you can delete cookies. <p></p>
<h3>2. HOW ROCKETJUMP USES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<p> RocketJump may use your Personal Information in the ways described below or described at the time that the information is collected. </p></div>
<div> In general, RocketJump and Third Parties use your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate for purposes including, but not limited, to: <p></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>administer your account;</li>
<li>register you and provide you access to the Site and/or Services;</li>
<li>respond to inquiries or requests in connection with the Site;</li>
<li>fulfill your requests for products or services;</li>

<li>send you newsletters and other messages, including changes to features of the Site and/or Service and special offers that you may opt out of by clicking “unsubscribe” in the email and/or by editing your preferences on your <a href="https://accounts.rocketjump.com">dashboard</a> page on the Site. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</li>
<li>send you promotional/marketing information, offers or other information regarding opportunities and functionality that RocketJump thinks would be of particular interest to you;</li>
<li>improve the quality of the Site and the Services; and</li>
<li>analyze, benchmark and conduct research on user data and user interactions with the Site and Services.</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
<h3>3. COOKIES AND TARGETED ADVERTISING</h3>
<h4><u>A. Tracking Technologies (e.g., Cookies)</u></h4>
<p> RocketJump and/or Third Parties may use tacking technologies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Site and Services. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, the video and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. For contests or sweepstakes, if any, RocketJump may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, RocketJump may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can’t vote more than once on a particular question or issue. RocketJump does not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer. </p></div>
<div> Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser’s directions within the help tab. In order to use certain Services offered through the Site, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Site or Service may not work properly, and you may not be able to access the Site and/or Services. </div>
<div> RocketJump may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. </div>
<div> An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. RocketJump, its partners or their respective service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Site or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements. <p></p>
<h4><u>B. Targeted Advertising</u></h4>
<p> RocketJump works with third party companies (<em>e.g.</em>, ad networks) that may use cookies for purposes including, without limitation, understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Site, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don’t see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site, another Site or any other website on the Internet if the website also has a relationship with RocketJump’s vendor. You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Site by clicking http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out. </p></div>
<div> RocketJump adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click here at http://www.aboutads.info/consumers). </div>
<div> Advertisers or other third parties on the Site may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. RocketJump does not control these advertisers or other parties’ use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the NAI OPT-OUT website (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA CHOICE PAGE (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and follow the instructions. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements, but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out. </div>
<div>

Access to your Personal Information by these service providers is limited to the information reasonably necessary to perform its limited function. </p>
<h4><u>C. Third Parties</u></h4>
<p> RocketJump may share aggregated Anonymous Information about you with the Third Parties. Aggregated information is your Anonymous Information that is combined with the Anonymous Information of other users. </p>

<p> Some or all of the information collected during promotions, contest, polls, or sweepstakes (collectively, “Promotions”) may be disclosed publicly.

These third parties may include providers of prizes in order to update you of your status of your prize if any, or other fulfillment needs or a co-sponsor who may use your Personal Information to administer the Promotion or for their marketing purposes, but only in conformance with their privacy policy as made available to you at the time of collection. RocketJump is not responsible for their privacy policy or practices. When you participate in a Promotion, you are subject to any official rules for that Promotion, which may contain additional information about the specific privacy practices associated with the Promotion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that any voting in connection with the Show, Site and/or Service by you shall not be deemed participation in and/or qualify as a Promotion under California law and/or for the purposes hereof, and RocketJump shall have no obligation and/or liability to you whatsoever in connection therewith, including without limitation, the obligation to award any prizes, gifts, and/or the assurance of any specific Show outcome or result. </p>
<h4><u>E. Affiliated Companies</u></h4>
<p> RocketJump may share your Personal Information and/or any other information collected hereunder with its subsidiaries and affiliated companies.

<h3>6. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h3>
<p> The Sites may link to websites operated by third parties that RocketJump does not control. RocketJump does not monitor, control, or endorse the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. RocketJump encourages you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.
