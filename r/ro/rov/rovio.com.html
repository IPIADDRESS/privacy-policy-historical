<p>&nbsp;</p>

Rovio has adopted this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) to explain how Rovio collects, stores, and uses the information collected in connection with Rovio’s Services.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions relating to this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@rovio.com or alternatively at Rovio Entertainment Ltd, Legal Department, Keilaranta 17 C, FI-02150 Espoo, Finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES. Rovio reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. If Rovio makes material or significant changes to this Privacy Policy, Rovio will post a notice on Rovio’s website along with the updated Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-personal data:</strong></p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Rovio collects about the use of Rovio Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.</p>
<p>Rovio may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Rovio to identify you. The types of non-personal data Rovio may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; (v) game score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Rovio to enhance the Services and other Rovio products and services.</p>
<p>Rovio may use and disclose to Rovio’s partners and contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Services and to further develop the Services and other Rovio services and products.</p>
<p>You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Rovio may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ad Serving Technology:</strong></p>
<p>Rovio reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Rovio or Rovio’s partners and contractors. Rovio may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. Rovio or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Rovio or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including for purposes of determining your approximate geographic location), UDID, software, applications, hardware, browser information, internet and on-line usage information and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p>
<p>You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Rovio may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although Rovio takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Rovio does not have access to or control of third party technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data:</strong></p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.</p>
<p>Likely situations when you make personal data available to Rovio include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Services, contests and special events; (ii) accessing Services using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iii) subscribing to newsletters; (iv) purchasing a product or services through Rovio’s online stores; (v) using “tell a friend,” "email this page," or other similar features; (vi) requesting technical support; and (vii) otherwise through use of Rovio Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.</p>

<p>If you choose to use Rovio’s "tell a friend" or a similar service about Rovio Services or order a gift certificate for your friend, Rovio will store your friend's name and contact details that you provide to Rovio.</p>
<p>Rovio may use collected personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Services (including managing advertisement serving) and to further develop the Services and other Rovio services and products. Rovio may combine non-personal data with personal data.</p>
<p>Please note that certain features of the Services may be able to connect to your social networking sites to obtain additional information about you.&nbsp; In such cases, Rovio may be able to collect certain information from your social networking profile when your social networking site permits it, and when you consent to allow your social networking site to make that information available to Rovio.&nbsp; This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, gender, user ID, email address, your country, your language, your time zone, the organizations and links on your profile page, the names and profile pictures of your social networking site “friends” and other information you have included in your social networking site profile.

<p>Rovio may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on Rovio’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Rovio.

Rovio may also disclose your personal data to third parties when Rovio has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with Rovio’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or Rovio believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect Rovio’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Rovio.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Retention and Correctness:</strong></p>
<p>Rovio retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, Rovio deletes all aforementioned data in its possession. Rovio does not verify the correctness of personal data.</p>
<p>Even if data is changed or deleted, Rovio may still retain some of the data to resolve disputes, enforce Rovio user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and beacons:</strong></p>
<p>The Services may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web beacons. Rovio treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.</p>
