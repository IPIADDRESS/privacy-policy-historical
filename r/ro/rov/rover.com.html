        <p>Updated April 20, 2012 [Previous versions: July 21, 2011 and November 14th, 2011].</p>

        <p>
        A Place for Rover, Inc. ("Rover.com," "we," "our,” or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to
        inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of
        personal information we receive from users of www.rover.com (this "Site"). At Rover.com,
        we understand that you value your privacy, and we want to help make your experience
        with our Site and other services we may offer (referred to in this policy collectively as
        our “Service”) satisfying and safe. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you
        provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We
        may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we
        make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified
        in your account) or by posting the revised policy on this Site prior to the change becoming
        effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our
        privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy
        Policy have the same meanings as in our <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

        <p>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies
        on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or
        handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating,
        modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our
        organization or among our affiliates within the United States.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, our
        Services, features and content, and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>

        <h2>2. Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

        <p>When you register with us through the Site and become a Rover.com Member, when
        you choose to post or reserve a listing, or when you contact a Rover.com Member using
        the “Contact” feature of the Site, we will collect personally identifiable information. This
        refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity
        Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number,
        email address and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or
        billing information. In order to process some of your transactions through the Site, we may
        also ask for your credit card number and billing information ("Billing Information") (Identity
        Information and Billing Information together, "Personal Information"). However, if the
        address of a listing you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address
        would be considered Identity Information. We use your Personal Information mainly to
        provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</p>

        <p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the
        administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip
        code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying
        Information"). Non-Identifying Information includes Personal Information that we aggregate
        or otherwise render anonymous.</p>

        <p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
        Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your
        inquiries. We may use your Personal Information (and disclose it to third parties) to verify
        your identity, derive other information about you, for fraud prevention, to enforce the terms
        of the <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>
        and otherwise protect the integrity of our Site or Service, or to verify
        other information you provided to us or included in your profile, including for example any
        associations, certifications, or other attributes of your profile. We may also verify your profile
        information through other means.</p>

        <p>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Rover.com newsletters,
        marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If
        you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us,
        please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update
        your "user preferences" information. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below.)
        Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information
        related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.</p>

        <h2>3. Log Data</h2>

        <p>When you visit the Site, whether as Rover.com Member or a non-registered user just
        browsing (any of these, a "Rover.com User"), our servers automatically record information
        that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may
        include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type
        or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you
        visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times
        and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of
        the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's
        functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also
        use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process
        their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association
        with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such
        information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying
        Information.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies</h2>

        <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file
        that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies
        for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login
        password for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable
        certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to
        monitor aggregate usage by Rover.com Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike
        persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from
        the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may
        also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing
        its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the
        websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all
        portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>

        <h2>5. Web Beacons</h2>

        <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called
        single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to
        analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which
        emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness
        of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

        <h2>6. Messages Sent Via a Rover.com Account</h2>

        <p>As part of the Service, Rover.com Users may communicate with Rover.com Members
        through use of the "Contact" feature on the site. Where Rover.com Users have selected the
        option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create
        in the corresponding template will be sent from Rover.com to those email addresses on
        their behalf. These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email
        communication to the addressee.</p>

        <p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@rover.com">support@rover.com</a> to request that we remove this
        information from our database, and we will use reasonable efforts to remove the
        information.</p>

        <p>You can import contacts from your email account address book to invite them to send you
        a recommendation. We collect the username and password for the email account you wish
        to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose only. By choosing to import
        your contacts, you consent to our access of your email address book.
        Your use of the “Contact” feature (or any other messaging feature) of the Site is subject
        to the <a href="/tos/">Terms of Service</a>.
        We have the right, but not the obligation, to review, save, edit,
        decline to transmit, and otherwise use such messages, including their contents, in our sole

        <h2>7. Phishing</h2>

        <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to
        Rover.com. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a priority.
        We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID,
        login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or
        telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade
        Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <p>Rover.com is designed to allow Members who have a home to host dogs ("Hosts"),
        Members who will travel to another Members home to watch pets ("Sitters"), and Members
        who wish to find care for their pets ("Pet Owners") to share information with one another in
        order to facilitate arranging stays and sittings. Listings posted by Hosts and Sitters, ratings
        and reviews of Hosts, Sitters and Pet Owners, and the Profile Information (as defined
        below) of Hosts and Pet Owners, are visible to any visitor to the site. If a Host or a Sitter
        and a Pet Owner enter into a confirmed transaction with one another (the Host accepts the
        Pet Owner's request, and the Pet Owner's payment details are collected and processed),
        then the Pet Owner and the Host's Identity Information are shared with each other in order
        to facilitate the reservation. In no event is a Pet Owner's Billing Information shared with their
        Host or Sitter.</p>

        <p><strong>If you post any of your information to a public area of our Service, please be aware
        that it is no longer Personal Information for the purposes of this policy, and we or
        anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to
        Personal Information or other information, including your email address or name,
        to a limited set of other users through any of our privacy controls or other settings,
        please understand that Rover.com has no control over how others may collect, use,
        or disclose such information.</strong></p>

        <h2>9. Rover.com Members and Users</h2>

        <p>When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile
        webpage, Rover.com Users will see your first name and last initial ("Required Member
        Identifiers"). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your
        profile ("Other Member Information") (together, your "Profile Information"). We will display
        your Profile Information in your profile page, elsewhere on the Site, and on third party
        sites (e.g., through the use of a Rover.com HTML "widget" or API). Any information you
        choose to provide as part of your profile should reflect how much you want other Rover.com
        Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive
        information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about
        themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile
        information at any time.</p>

        <p>If you post a listing, we may publish that listing anywhere on the Site and may enable
        third parties to publish your listing on their site through the use of an HTML "widget".
        We may also display the geographical location of your listing in the form of a map so
        that potential guests can see the general area and neighborhood of your listing, but your
        actual street address will not be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction
        with another Rover.com Member. If you enter into a confirmed transaction with another
        Rover.com Member (that is, you request hosting or sitting from another Member, the other
        Member confirms your reservation, and your payment is processed, you will have access
        to that Member's Identity Information, and that Member will have access to your Identity
        Information. Note that Members will never have access to your Billing Information.</p>

        <h2>10. Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</h2>

        <p>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we
        may otherwise share disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for

        use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business

        safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to
