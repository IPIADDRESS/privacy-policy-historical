						<p><b>Privacy Statement for www.roxio.com <br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy outlines our information gathering and usage practices for 
  www.roxio.com and other web-sites hosted by Roxio. Its purpose is to notify 
  you of what personally identifiable information of yours ("User Information") 
  is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be 
  shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution 
  of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect 
  the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and 
  how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</b></p>
<p>             
              
           Roxio does not rent, 
  sell or lease User Information we have collected through our web site. However, 
  we may share User Information, collected through our web site, with other third parties after giving you 
  the opportunity to opt out prior to any information being exchanged. Local country 
  laws are applied where they differ from this policy.</p>
<p>We are firmly committed to guarding the confidence you have placed in our company 
  and to use, responsibly and professionally, any information you volunteer. We 
  strive to collect only that information that we think is necessary for our legitimate 
  business interests, such as to better understand you (our customer), to provide 
  better service, to improve marketing of our products, to educate customers and 
  to ensure that our proprietary information is protected. We are committed to 
  using the information collected only for these purposes and those outlined below. 
  Our web site visitors from Europe should note that Roxio has developed this 
  policy with the intent of complying with the International Safe Harbor Privacy 
  Principles between the United States and Europe. If you do not want to share 
  personal data, please read below for information on how to opt out or change 
  personal information Roxio collects from you.</p>
<p>Links to third party web sites, from this web site, are provided solely as

</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In order to improve our problem resolution process through better product and 
  case tracking, Roxio's tech support department has implemented online product 
  registration and technical support service. We require contact information and 
  either product serial number or TSID number to identify your product. This information 
  is used to manage your case, notify you when necessary of issues related to 
  your product and, together with your voluntary responses to our marketing survey, 
  it is used to analyze our customer base in aggregate. Occasionally, we may send 
  emails to give customers information we think you will find useful, such as 
  information about new features, products or promotions. When we ema il you, 
  we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe so you will 
  not receive our emails in the future. You may also opt-out of receiving future 
  Roxio and/or partner communications by submitting your request through our on-line 
  Feedback form.</p>
<p><b>Sweepstakes, Contests &amp; Promotions:</b> Roxio occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, 
  contests and promotions. We use contact data from our promotions to send users 
  information we think you will find useful, such as information about new products 
  or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining 
  how to unsubscribe, so you will not receive our emails in the future.</p>
<p><b>Online Store:</b> To process your order we require name, billing address, 
  phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. We 
  use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact 
  you about your order. In general, we will try to contact you first by email 
  and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by 
  phone. Your order is processed, on our behalf, by Yahoo, a provider 
  of e-commerce services. View <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/">Yahoo!'s 
  Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p><b>Online Surveys: </b>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information 
  (like email address). This may be used to contact you if additional follow-up 
  is appropriate, but will not be used for future marketing purposes, unless explicitly 
  stated.</p>
<p><b>Email Newsletters:</b> Roxio distributes various product- or topic-specific 
  newsletters. We require first name and last name, so that we may personalize 
  your greeting, email address and in some cases your country, as not all offers 
  are valid in all countries. Typically all other contact information is voluntary 
  and may be used to send other information or offers via mail. We do not share 
  your information with third parties, except as required to deliver our message. 
  Here is a list of existing email newsletters. Follow the link to subscribe and/or 
  unsubscribe.

  where we request your information. Also, in our e-mail communications you will 
  find instructions for unsubscribing.

<p> Most email communications provide a uniquely coded URL so customers can unsubscribe 
  from individual lists. 
</p><p> <b>Correcting or Updating your Personal Info:</b> To change or modify or remove 
  information previously provided, we recommend that you reply or contact that 
  list source directly. If no instructions were provided for updating your contact

</p><p> <b>Privacy and Children:</b> Roxio and the Roxio web sites do not target children

  1998. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information 
  from a child we will make all reasonable efforts to delete that data from our 
  records.

  under our control, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and 
  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

  of such an inadvertent disclosure, Roxio will do everything commercially reasonable 
  to limit and remedy the disclosure, but Roxio accepts no liability for any unintentional 
  disclosure. In addition, in the unlikely event that any government or private
