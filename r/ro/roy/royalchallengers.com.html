Methods We Use to Collect Information
</p>
<p>
A "cookie" is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies. 
<br>
A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.
<br>
A "persistent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire,) they are overwritten with newer cookies, c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features. 
<br>
This site may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on <a href="http://www.royalchallengers.com/" target="_self"> www.royalchallengers.com</a>. To do this, ad networks place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. <a href="http://www.royalchallengers.com/" target="_self"> www.royalchallengers.com</a> does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

<br>
When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.royalchallengers.com/" target="_self"> www.royalchallengers.com</a> uses Google geocoding web service application programming interface (API) to attempt to determine location of users in order to show "nearest" events of interest to them.
