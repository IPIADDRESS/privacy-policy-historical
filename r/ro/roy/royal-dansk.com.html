<p>We gather Personal Data from you related to contact information, such as first and last names, home address, telephone number and email addresses, and your enquiry that you provide voluntarily when you fill in appropriate sections of our website or when you directly message us via our social media channels. We collect this or similar Personal Data, for example, when you complete our “Contact Us” section or otherwise enquire about product availability, nutrition and ingredients, or provide feedback.&nbsp; We may also collect similar Personal Data when you enter a competition via our Sites, on pack promotions or through social media.&nbsp; We also may collect information contained in records of communications between you and us, including emails and text messages, and information regarding your marketing preferences.&nbsp; You may also provide us with Personal Data via consumer reviews or other online forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

We may also aggregate Personal Data to create statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services and may provide such aggregated statistical information to third parties.&nbsp; These statistics do not include information that identifies an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a name="sharing"></a>4.<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>We may share your Personal Data within the Kelsen Family and certain selected companies.&nbsp; By “Kelsen Family,” we mean the companies within the same group as Kelsen, including our parent company, The Campbell Soup Company, and our affiliates.&nbsp; The selected companies are those that provide technical assistance and perform other functions to support our marketing and consumer care activities.&nbsp; These third-parties include IT service providers, consumer care operations, and marketing and promotions agencies.&nbsp; In some cases, third party providers may act as Data Controller with respect to your Personal Data and in those instances, we suggest you review their privacy notices.</p>
<p>The selected companies may have access to Personal Data if needed to perform such functions, but will only be permitted by us to use such Personal Data for the purpose of performing that function (which may include one to which you have expressly given your consent) and not for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers. However, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>
<p><br>
We reserve the right to use or disclose any personal information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfil your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement or regulatory investigation. We do not sell, or rent Personal Data we have collected from you in connection with our website activities to third parties.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a name="transfering"></a>5.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>TRANSFERING YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EU/EEA</h3>
<p>We may transfer the personal information we collect about you outside of the European Union/European Economic Area (“EU/EEA”), for example, to our parent company, the Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell”), and our affiliates under the same parent company ("Affiliates") situated outside the EU/EEA.&nbsp; Data protection law imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU/EEA, but such transfers can be made if the country to which we transfer the data has an adequate level of protection for your rights, there are appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses in place allowing the transfer to take place, you have provided your consent or the transfer is necessary for reasons set out in the data protection laws.</p>
<p>If we transfer your information outside of the EU/EEA to a third country without an adequacy decision by the European Commission, we will take appropriate measures so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Notice.&nbsp; We use standard clauses to transfer to companies in the Kelsen family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a name="security"></a>6.<span style="white-space:pre">	</span>SECURITY AND RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The internet is not a secure medium and Kelsen cannot guarantee the security of your personal information provided over the internet.&nbsp; As such, any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.&nbsp; We use reasonable efforts to implement procedures and security features to help maintain the security of your Personal Data from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>We will retain your personal information for different periods of time depending on the reason why it was collected or as long as the law requires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
