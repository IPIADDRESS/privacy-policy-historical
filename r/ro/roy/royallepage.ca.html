We have adopted the following Privacy Policy to ensure that Royal LePage continues to meet its commitment to your privacy.</p>
<h3>The following sections, read as a whole, constitute the Royal LePage Privacy Policy:</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Royal LePage provides a variety of products and services to the public, including, but not limited to, real estate brokerage services, real estate agency services, advising with respect to real estate purchase and sale, home leasing, property management, real estate brokerage franchising services, and other real estate advisory services.</p>
<p>In the course of providing these products and services, Royal LePage may collect certain personal information about its clients with their consent.</p>
<p>“Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual.

Personal Information does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.</p>
<p>The Royal LePage Privacy Policy is based on, and complies with, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), which includes the Ten Privacy Principles outlined in the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Privacy.

All of our employees who have access to Personal Information must adhere to the Royal LePage Privacy Policy and related procedures. To this end, Royal LePage has appointed a privacy officer to ensure compliance by all Royal LePage employees and to address your privacy concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Principle 6: Accuracy</strong><br>
Royal LePage will keep Personal Information as accurate, complete, and current as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes for which it was collected. You may have this information amended where it is found to be inaccurate or incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 7: Safeguarding personal information</strong><br>
Personal Information is safeguarded using measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 8: Openness</strong><br>

<p><strong>Principle 9: Access</strong><br>
Upon written request, you will be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information, and will be given access to it.

<p><strong>Principle 10: Addressing complaints and suggestions</strong><br>
You may challenge Royal LePage compliance with this Privacy Policy. Royal LePage has policies and procedures to receive, investigate, and respond to complaints and questions regarding this Privacy Policy and our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. You may contact the Royal LePage Privacy Officer to express any concerns or to request access to your Personal Information. The contact information for this individual is provided at the end of this document.</p>
<h3>Application of the ten privacy principles – how we treat your personal information</h3>
<p><strong>The kind of information we collect</strong><br>
Royal LePage gathers and uses Personal Information in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, namely: information that is required to effectively market and sell the property of sellers or lessors; to locate, assess, and qualify properties for buyers; to evaluate independent broker applicants; and to otherwise provide professional and competent real estate services to clients as well as to ensure that you are satisfied with the products and services we have provided. Royal LePage may also use your Personal Information to update you about our services and to offer you additional products or services that you may be interested in, so that we may continue to serve your real estate needs.</p>
<p>We may be required to collect your social insurance number if the federal government obligates us to do so pursuant to the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>If you visit Royal LePage Web sites, we do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it. All information that you do provide us with is securely maintained and kept strictly confidential. This Privacy Policy does not apply to aggregated data from which it is not possible to determine the identity of a specific individual. Royal LePage reserves the right to use aggregated data in any way that it determines appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>How we use your information</strong><br>
At Royal LePage we use Personal Information for three general purposes:</p>
<p>To communicate with you in order to provide you with our products and services.<br>
For inclusion in documentation relating to your particular real estate transaction.<br>
Transactional information to monitor our level of service and report back to you to ensure your satisfaction with the provision of such services.<br>
We will only use Personal Information for the purpose that we have disclosed to you. If we want to use your information for a different purpose, we will notify you and ask for your consent first.</p>
<p><strong>When we are permitted to disclose your information</strong><br>
Royal LePage is obliged to keep your Personal Information confidential except under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(i) When authorized by you</p>
<p>Many of the services offered by Royal LePage require us to obtain Personal Information about you in order to perform the services you have engaged us to provide. We will always obtain consent from you first, and we will never use the information for purposes other than those we have told you about.</p>
<p>You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to any legal implications (which we will inform you about). In some cases, if you do not consent to our use or disclosure of certain Personal Information, we may be unable to continue to provide all or part of the services you have requested.</p>
<p>(ii) When required by law</p>
<p>The type of information we are legally required to disclose usually relates to government tax reporting requirements. In some cases, however, such as under a court order, we may be required to disclose certain information to persons specified in the court order. We will only provide the specific information requested and only upon being satisfied that the authorities have legitimate grounds to request the information.</p>
<p>(iii) When permitted by law</p>
<p>The legislation has provided certain situations where Royal LePage is legally permitted to disclose Personal Information without your consent. Examples include situations involving the collection of debt in arrears, medical emergencies, or suspicion of illegal activities.</p>
<p><strong>With whom we may share your information</strong><br>
(i) Royal LePage employees</p>
<p>In the course of daily operations, access to sensitive Personal Information is limited to those employees with a legitimate reason for accessing it. As a condition of their employment, Royal LePage employees are required to follow all applicable laws and regulations, including this Privacy Policy. Unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential client information by any Royal LePage employee is prohibited and may result in disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>(ii) Royal LePage affiliates</p>
<p>In order to better meet your needs, we may share some of your Personal Information with our affiliates. We will only do this with your express consent and you may withdraw this consent at any time. The procedure for withdrawing consent is outlined below under the section “Opting Out.”</p>
<p>(iii) Royal LePage third-party suppliers</p>
<p>As you may know, we may engage and coordinate third-party suppliers to provide you with certain services offered through Royal LePage. Such suppliers are only given the information that is needed to provide the specific service for which we contract them to provide. Suppliers are obliged to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information and are prohibited from doing anything with this information that we have not authorized them to do. They are required to treat your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Royal LePage Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(iv) Sale of business</p>
<p>We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party in connection with a sale, merger, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of our business.</p>
<p><strong>How we safeguard information</strong><br>
Royal LePage has extensive controls in place to maintain the security of its information and information systems. Client and independent broker files are stored according to the sensitivity of the information contained therein. Appropriate controls (such as restricted access) are placed on our computer systems and data processing procedures. Physical access to areas where Personal Information is gathered, processed, or stored is limited to authorized employees.</p>
<p>When you telephone a Royal LePage employee to speak about your file, you may be asked for some personally identifying information. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorized by you, has access to your file.</p>
<p><strong>Website security</strong><br>
In order to serve you better, Royal LePage offers clients access to certain information through its websites.</p>
<p>http://www.royallepage.ca provides general information about Royal LePage and the products and services it offers.</p>
<p>The Royal LePage Web site contains links to other Web sites, including those of its business partners. Royal LePage is in no way responsible and cannot guarantee the content or privacy of other sites linked to www.royallepage.ca.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing and amending your information</strong><br>
As a client or Royal LePage broker, you have the right to access the Personal Information we keep in your file and you have the right to verify or amend the information if it is shown to be inaccurate. If you would like to view the Personal Information held in your file, please make a written request to the Privacy Officer at the address listed below, under “Questions, Concerns, and Complaints”. We will respond to your request as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>To make a change, please make a similar request in writing to the Privacy Officer.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out</strong><br>
In order to provide you with our services and products, Royal LePage will, with your consent, share your personal information with other Royal LePage affiliates.
