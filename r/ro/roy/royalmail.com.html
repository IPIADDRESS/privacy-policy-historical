			<li>
				To provide you with services that you may request including but not limited to online services. Each service has different requirements. Therefore the information we need, and what it is needed for, can differ. For full details please refer to the terms and conditions for each service.</li>
			<li>
				To enhance or improve your experience on our website and/or with us generally. When you indicate your preferences through our registration forms or through your use of our website, we will use this information to personalise the website and/or our services to better meet your needs.</li>
			<li>
				To provide you with information about products and services that we, or third parties we have carefully selected, believe will be of interest to you (please see the sections below headed “Who sees your information” and “Important information about opting-in and opting-out”).</li>

			We collect information from you in three ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Directly from you. Sometimes we'll ask you for information about yourself, for example in our registration form or when you make a purchase on our website, or if you contact our customer service helpdesk.</li>
			<li>
				From third parties. We may ask for information about you from third parties, for example when we get authorisation for a payment you make using a credit or debit card or if we need to conduct fraud or credit checks.</li>
			<li>
				From how you use our website and our services.&nbsp; This can show us, for example, which products you use most and least.&nbsp; We will use this information to personalise the website and/or the services to better meet your needs and, where you have given us your consent by not opting-out on the registration form, to provide you with information about our products and services we believe will be of interest to you.</li>

		Who sees your information?</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			The information we collect will be used within the Royal Mail group of companies. Click here for a <a href="http://www.royalmailgroup.com/who-we-are/our-brands">current list of those companies</a>. Exactly who sees your information depends on the context in which you provided it and the purpose for which it is being used (please see the section above headed “Why we collect information about you”).<br>
			<br>
			Sometimes we'll share your information with carefully selected third parties outside the Royal Mail group. We may do this for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To provide you with a service. Some of our services are provided in conjunction with our business partners, and we'll need to disclose your information to them to provide you with the services. We make it clear in the terms and conditions for each service whether information will be passed to third parties or not. We may also share your information with certain third parties performing services for us where this will help us to provide services to you, or to improve the quality of the services that we provide to you.</li>
			<li>
				To provide you with information about special promotions and offers. If you have given your consent by choosing to opt in on the registration form, we may share some of your information with carefully selected third parties so that they can provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you.</li>
			<li>
				To protect the Royal Mail group or others. We may share your information with third parties when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our or another person’s&nbsp; rights, property, or safety. This includes exchanging information with third parties to protect against fraud and to reduce payment risks.</li>
			<li>
				In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets and if this happens we may disclose your information to the potential seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br>
			We will only deal with third parties that we trust to act in our customers’ best interests and who treat our customers’ information with the same stringent controls that we apply ourselves.</p>

			Generally we will store and process your information within the UK. However, the information that we collect about you may be processed in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) where privacy laws may not provide the same level of protection as within the EEA. By registering to use our website, you agree to this processing, transfer and/or storage outside of the EEA.

			In particular:</p>
		<ul>

		How we keep your information secure</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			We know that your privacy is very important to you and that you take the security of your information seriously.<br>
			<br>
			We've implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal information we have under our control, both on and off-line, from improper access, use, alteration, destruction and loss.<br>
			<br>
			Here are some of the ways we protect your information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Access to our online services is protected by something called SSL 128 bit session encryption. Encryption is the process through which sensitive information is scrambled before it is transmitted so that it remains private even if it is intercepted. 128-bit encryption is the strongest encryption currently used commercially. However, unless your Internet browser supports 128-bit encryption you will not be able to take advantage of this level of security (please see the section below headed 'How you can help keep your information secure').</li>
			<li>
				Off-line, your information is kept securely in our databases and offices. We only allow our employees and trusted contractors access to your information, and then only if they need it for a specific authorised task. The computers on which we store your information are kept in a secure environment.</li>
			<li>
				We do not store payment card details, except those collected through the SmartStamp® service for the purpose of regular payments.</li>

		How you can help keep your information secure online</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
			There is a lot that you can do to help keep your information safe - not just on our website, but whenever you provide information online.<br>
			<br>
			Here are some simple ways you can improve the security of your information.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use a strong password</strong><br>
			Read our advice on choosing a <a href="/your-questions-answered">strong password</a>. This will help you choose a password that will be difficult for other people to guess but easy for you to remember.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use a secure password hint</strong><br>
			Do not make your password hint the same as your password! Your password hint should not give away your password to someone you know well, for example 'my road' or 'my dog's name'.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Keep your password private and secure</strong><br>
			Your password is a key to your personal information and online identity. Don't tell anyone your password or write it down. If you are concerned that somebody else knows your password, you can change it on our website by going to the Edit Your Profile page. We recommend that you change your password from time to time.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Use a secure browser</strong><br>
			Modern browsers are more secure than older versions, so always keep your browser up to date. If you browse with Internet Explorer, set Windows to update itself automatically to keep your private data safe.<br>
			<br>

			When you use the website, a Website Analytic cookie will be saved on your computer. Some pages of our website have web beacons - or 'tags' - coded into them, and when you visit those pages, register or enter into certain transactions, the Website Analytic cookie will record that you have done so.

This information, together with similar information from other users, helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our website attracts, which of our products and applications most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see (called website analytics).
