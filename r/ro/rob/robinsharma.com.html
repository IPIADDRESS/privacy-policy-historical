            <p>
                How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information. After such time, we will either
                delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your information and
                isolate
                it from any further use until deletion is possible.

            <p>
                We retain Personal Information that you provide to us where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for
                example, as long as is required in order to contact you about the Subscription Service or our other services, or as

                to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements).
            </p>

            <p>

                or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from
                any
                further processing until deletion is possible. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if
                you
                so request, as described in "To Unsubscribe from Our Communications" below.
