                The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of Titan Academy Global
                (“Robin Sharma” “we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about
                you while you are using RobinSharma.com (the “Site”) or any of our other websites or publications, and
                the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy
                statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or
                through other means (for example, via telephone, or through the mail).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of
                our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an
                evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case
                we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the
                policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes,
                you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>

            <p>
                We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while
                using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the
                Site).Robin Sharmaonly contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that
                they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have purchased one of our
                products. Robin Sharmacollects personally identifying information from our users during online
                registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for
                registration or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card information when registering
                for our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the
                Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which
                allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on
                the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your
                experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for
                record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver
                advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also
                prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have
                entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files
                also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open
                HTML-formatted email messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including
                using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other
                offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information to
                third parties, such as service providers, contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for a
                variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the
                right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you
                while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to
                provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used
                for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at
                the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for
                these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties. To stop receiving our marketing emails,
                send an e-mail to us at support@RobinSharma.comor follow the opt-out procedures set forth in such
                marketing emails.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing
                by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas –
                that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any
                unauthorized third-party use of such information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also
                may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party
                advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to
                help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and
                collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the
                relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy
                policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any
                concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should
                visit that party’s website and review its privacy policy.

            </p>
            <p>
                We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site or by emailing messages
                to you through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider

                our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any
                pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider
                partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider
                partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider
                partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our

                Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event
                that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company,

            <h2>Google Analytics</h2>

            <p>
                We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
                <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
                <li>DoubleClick Platform integrations</li>
                <li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>

                By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our visitors by
                disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such

                DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on
                our Site. Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form
                but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order. The “Remarketing”
                feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the
