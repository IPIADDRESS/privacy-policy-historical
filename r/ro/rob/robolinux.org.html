         <p class="disclaimer"><strong>What We Do To Protect You.</strong><br>
           Robolinux.org LLC, finds that the best way to protect
           our customers on the Internet is to inform them about what information
           we gather, how we use it and how we protect your information. We do
           not sell or rent your personal information to other advertisers or
           third parties. </p>
         <p class="disclaimer"><strong>What information do we collect? How do we use it?</strong><br>
          When you order, Paypal needs to know your name, street address, e-mail address and daytime 
          telephone number and your credit card information. This allows them to process and fulfill 
          your order and to telephone you if they have a question on your order. Robolinux.org LLC does not
          collect any information unless you email us. </p>
         <p class="disclaimer">We may also use the information we collect to notify you from time
           to time about new services and special offers we think you'll find
           valuable. These solicitations will be e-mailed to you only. Your phone
           number will not be used for marketing and will not be contacted unless
           there is a problem with your account.</p>
         <p class="disclaimer"><strong>How do we protect customer information?</strong><br>
          When you place orders Paypal uses a 128 bit encryption secure server. The secure server 
          software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to them. Furthermore, all
          of the customer data they collect is protected against unauthorized
          access. </p>
         <p class="disclaimer"><strong>What about "cookies"?</strong><br>
         "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser
         on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
         but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. We only use cookies

         you have visited our site previously, and (iii) help us determine whether you
         came from a particular site or advertisement. </p>
         <p class="disclaimer"><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
         By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this
         information by Robolinux.org LLC, Inc If in the future the need arises
         to change our privacy policy, all changes will be posted on this page

         use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. </p>
