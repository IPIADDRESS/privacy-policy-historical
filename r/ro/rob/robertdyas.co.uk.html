<h4>Security and Data Protection</h4>
<p>At Robert Dyas we take your privacy and security seriously, that is why we ensure that our security policy is up to date with the latest services to protect you when shopping online. Below you will find information regarding the key aspects of our secure shopping service.</p>
<h4>1. Verified by VISA and Mastercard® SecureCode™</h4>
<p>Verified by VISA and Mastercard® SecureCode™ are new services from VISA and Mastercard in association with your card issuer to provide added protection when you buy online. There is no need to get a new card (great news!), you just need to choose your own personal code for your existing card. This information is never shared with any of the retailers or merchants. It is a private code that means added protection against unauthorised use of your credit or debit card when you shop online. This should not be confused with your normal pin number that you use when shopping in the high street or when using cash machines. To choose your new code, you will need to register by following the website links provided below. <br>
<br>
When shopping on our website, if you card is eligible for these schemes (currently only available on credit cards but not debit cards), you may see a pop up window appear when you are at the checkout. This pop up will be provided by the bank that issued the card you are making payment with. If you have not already registered your card, you can use this pop up and follow the instructions to register securely. Once registered, you will be taken back to the Robert Dyas website to complete your order. If you are at all concerned or confused, simply close the pop up window and complete your order as normal, then contact your bank to find out more about the schemes. <b>Once registered, you will then be required to use your personal code on all subsequent online transactions.</b> <br>
<br>
These services are effectively the online equivalent of chip &amp; pin, which is the only secure way to shop in the high street. By replicating this high street security, Robert Dyas is providing you with a secure and safe online shopping service. <br>
<br>
If you would like to learn more about these services, please click on the logos to the right where you will find links to the relevant websites or visit: <br>
<br>
If you use Mastercard: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastercardsecurecode.com/">www.mastercardsecurecode.com</a><br>
If you have a VISA debit or credit card: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visaeu.com/iusevisa/shoppingonline.html">http://www.visaeu.com/iusevisa/shoppingonline.html</a></p>
<h4>2. SafeBuy Assurance Scheme</h4>
<p>Robert Dyas is a member of the SafeBuy Assurance Scheme for online retailers. Robert Dyas' accreditation registration number is 507082. <br>
<br>
When you shop online with a retailer displaying the SafeBuy logo, you have the guarantee that the retailer conforms to the Data Protection Act 1998 as well as the terms of the Sale of Goods Act, the EU Distance Selling Regulations and the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications. To find out more about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.safebuy.org.uk/what-is-safebuy.html">SafeBuy please click here</a>.</p>
<h4>3. Handling your personal data</h4>
<p>If you are interested in placing an order with us on-line, but are concerned about how <b>safe and reliable</b> it will be, here is some information about how we manage and protect your data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cookies (small text files put on your PC) are used on this shopping site, but only to keep track of the contents of your shopping cart once you have selected an item</li>
    <li>Our <b>secure server</b> software encrypts information to ensure your transactions with us are private and protected as they travel over the Internet. All credit card transactions are either handled by an approved third party or on a secure server using a minimum of SSL/128-bit encryption</li>
    <li>When you make a purchase from our website, we collect certain personal information from you (for example: your name, email address, payment address and details). All such personal information is held on secure servers, and will be treated as <b>fully confidential</b>. We <b>do not</b> disclose this information to 3rd Parties for marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Data Protection</h4>
<p>Robert Dyas is committed to supporting the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 ('the Act') which aims "to regulate the use of automatic processed information relating to individuals and the provision of services in respect of such information". Robert Dyas has registered as a Data user under the Act. Robert Dyas subscribes to the principles set out in the Act for the handling of personal data as outlined below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The information contained in the personal data held by the Company is obtained and processed fairly and lawfully, i.e. in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</li>
    <li>Personal data held by the Company is only held for specified and lawful purposes.</li>
    <li>Personal data held by the company will not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with any lawful purpose.</li>
    <li>Personal data held by the Company will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it was obtained.</li>
    <li>Personal data held by the Company will be accurate (insofar as the Company can control this process, being dependent on customer integrity and the integrity of such credit reference agencies as it uses) and kept up to date.</li>
    <li>Personal data held by the company will only be kept for as long as is necessary for a particular purpose - the Company specifically needs to keep names and addresses of customers in order to deal with any queries, complaints or after sales service enquiries.</li>
    <li>The Company will advise any customer who enquires, whether the Company holds personal data on that customer and will respond appropriately if the customer requires the data to be corrected or erased.</li>
    <li>The Company has in place appropriate security measures against unauthorised access or alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of such data.</li>
    <li>Any enquiries relating to the Company's data protection policy should be addressed to the Data Compliance Officer at Robert Dyas Holdings Limited at Cleeve Court, Cleeve Road, Leatherhead, Surrey KT22 7SD</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p><b>We do not sell, rent, loan, or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties. </b></p>
<h4>Personal information</h4>
<p>Robert Dyas respects your privacy. In general, you can visit Robert Dyas on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as your full name, home address, e-mail address and phone number. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet. In order to place an order on our website you will be asked to log in using an email address and password. This enables us to send you confirmation of when you order has been dispatched as well as providing you with an easy log in for future visits to the website. <br>
<br>
If you choose to give us personal information through the Internet that we may need to correspond with you or process an order, it is our intent to let you know how we will use this information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do not send random marketing emails to personal email addresses (spam). <br>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>We collect information to determine how to improve our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular</li>
    <li>We collect information in order to personalise the site for our customers. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you may like based on what you have liked in the past</li>
    <li>We keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyse this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it. We do not sell, rent, loan, or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Disclosure Exceptions</h4>
<p>Notwithstanding the above policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that such action is necessary:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order;</li>
    <li>To protect the company's rights and property;</li>
    <li>To investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;</li>
    <li>To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web site; or</li>
    <li>During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>There are various technologies, including one called "cookies", which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Web site. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system.
