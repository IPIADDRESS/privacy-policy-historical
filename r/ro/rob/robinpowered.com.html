<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="big">Last updated December 27, 2016</p>
<br>
<p>Welcome to Robin. You've arrived either via https://robinpowered.com (the "Site") or the Robin platform (the "Platform"). To keep things simple, we'll call the two of these the "Service" throughout this policy. This Privacy Policy explains Robin’s policy for personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information we collect from both users and visitors to the Service.</p>
<p>The Service is owned and operated by Robin Powered, Inc. (“Robin”, “we,” “our” or “us”). Before we start, you should know that we take privacy seriously, especially when it comes to data you provide us. Our business is enabling better workplaces, not selling user data you’ve trusted us with. That being said, there are certain ways that we’ll use your Personal Data which this policy explains in detail.</p>
<p>We’ve done our best to write this in clear language for humans. If any part of this privacy policy is unclear, we're happy to guide you: <a href="mailto:privacy@robinpowered.com">privacy@robinpowered.com</a></p>
<hr>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect through the any version of the Service. It governs how we receive and handle information.</p>
<p>This privacy policy doesn't apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data collection that happens offline or outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data practices of third parties who may interact with our Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robin is responsible for data we share with 3rd parties in relation to our service, but we are not responsible for any unauthorized or unofficial integrations that our customers create</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To get the full picture, you should also review:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our <a href="/terms" title="Full terms for Robin usage">Terms of Use</a></p></li>
<li><p>Your Service Agreement. If you're a registered user of the Service, this document has a few extra terms that may apply to you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>By using our Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. You also consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information, data, and other activities, as described below.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="information-collected">What information do we collect?</h3>
<h4>Information you give us</h4>
<p><strong>Personal Data</strong>. As you use the Service, we may ask you for personally identifiable information like your name or email address. We'll call this "Personal Information". We may collect Personal Information through forms and other interactions on the Service. This includes places like account registration, contact forms, account profile, and "personas".</p>
<h4>Information collected as you use the Service</h4>
<p>We automatically collect and store information when you interact with the Service ("Usage Information"). By default we limit Usage Information access to Robin and its third party service providers (e.g. hosting). If you've approved access for any third parties, we'll also share with them.</p>
<p>We store and access Usage Information using a few technologies downloaded to your device. This happens whenever you interact with our Service. In our world, a "Device" may be your personal computer, browser, tablet, mobile phone, or wearable. Usage Information associated with Personal Information provided via the Service becomes Personal Information too.</p>
<p>Usage Information includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Details about your activities at a Robin location, limited to what you approved upon arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>Ways to identify your device. Your IP address, UUID, or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a string that Robin automatically assigns to your Device to access the Service.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Device functionality (e.g. browser, operating system, hardware, and mobile network).</p></li>
<li><p>How you found the Service (e.g. referring website)</p></li>
<li><p>Your activity in the Service. So we can do things like remember you and your preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Device's location.</p></li>
<li><p>General information about your Device (e.g. characteristics, time of day, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Tracking Technology</h4>
<p>We or our vendors may use a few methods to store or collect Usage Information ("Tracking Technologies"). Tracking Technologies may set and change settings on your Device.</p>
<p>One of the ways we do this is through "cookies". A cookie is a small files our Service gives your Device when it's accessed. We use cookies to enable functionality, improve Service usage analytics, and market the service. For example, a cookie allows us to keep you logged in during a session rather than asking for a password at every action. Another example is as a security measure to prevent fraudulent activity with your accounts. You can disable cookies on your Device, but parts of the Service may not be functional without them.</p>
<p>We and our vendors may also use tools like web beacons ("clear gifs"), scripts, and images to help manage site content and usage.</p>
<p>These technologies help us understand the performance and usefulness of content in the Service. We use these insights to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.</p>
<p>Tracking Technologies used by our service providers are not covered by this policy. We don't have control over them, but do screen to make sure they have acceptable policies before integrating.</p>
<h5>Tracking Consent</h5>
<p>We get your consent to our storage and collection Tracking Technologies in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Giving you transparent information in this Privacy Policy</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing you to choose to third parties access to your data</p></li>
<li><p>Giving you the opportunity to choose to disable cookies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FYI:</strong> We are not required to get consent for Tracking Technology that's strictly necessary to the Service. For example, using cookies as a way to improve security through fraud prevention.</p>
<h5>Third Party Tracking</h5>
<p>Robin may use other Tracking Technologies (some which may not exist yet) in connection with the Service in the future.</p>
<p>Third parties (including vendors) may also use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service. They may collect information about your online activities across third party websites or services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. You consent to encountering third party Tracking Technologies as you use our Service. You also accept that our Privacy Policy does not apply to Tracking Technologies or practices of third parties.</p>
<h5>"Do Not Track"</h5>
<p>Some third parties have ways (e.g. Browser do-not-track signals) for users to control how online services collect their information. We don't currently take any action based on these signals, however this may change in the future.</p>
<h4>Information third parties provide about you</h4>
<p>We may combine information collected directly from you on our Service with third party records. This information allows us to give you a better experience by customizing content and opportunities to you. Unless disclosed otherwise, combined information becomes Personal Information and this Privacy Policy will apply.</p>
<p>Aside from the above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information we receive about you from third parties. This includes if they have used our technology to collect and share information with us.</p>
<h4>Interactions with third party services</h4>
<p>Parts of the Service may include certain interactions with third-party websites or applications. This functionality may involve the third-party operator giving us certain information, including Personal Information. When you register with the Service for example, you may have an option to link your account to a third party account (e.g. Google) to help the registration, log in and transaction process. or otherwise. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality in our Service, the third-party may send your Personal Information to us. We will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy because we collect it as a result of you using our Service.</p>
<p>We may also provide third-party sites' interfaces or links in the Service to help you send communications. For example, a share button for emailing links via the Service. These third parties may keep information used or provided in communications or other activities. These third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Robin may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.</p>
<p>When you use third party services, they are responsible for their practices. We can only vouch for our services and policies, and cannot be responsible for their practices. Be sure to review third-party policies before using their tools on our Service.</p>
<h4>How we handle payments</h4>
<p>We use vetted third party vendors for credit card transactions and billing when you register to use the Service. All credit card transactions are handled separately through their servers. They don't share complete financial account information with Robin. You can find our current vendor's privacy policy here: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.
</p><hr>
<h3>How do we use information we collect?</h3>
<p>We may use Personal, Demographic or Usage Information that we collect about you:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To give you information, services, or process transactions you request or agree to receive. This includes sending email or promotional materials on behalf of us or approved third parties.</p></li>
<li><p>To enable you to use the Services' features.</p></li>
<li><p>To process your registration to use the Services, including verifying that your information is active and valid.</p></li>
<li><p>To improve the Services or create new service offerings. To customize your experience and content on the Services.</p></li>
<li><p>To contact you about your use of the Services. This includes (at our discretion) changes to the any of the Services and/or any of the Services' policies.</p></li>
<li><p>To send marketing emails about third party products and services when you have indicated your consent to receive such emails.</p></li>
<li><p>For internal business purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4>Inquiries</h4>
<p>When you contact us, we will use that information only for reasons connected with your request. Not all information submitted the Service via a "contact us" form or other similar inquiry method may receive a response.</p>
<hr>
<h3>When do we share information with third parties?</h3>
<p>There are certain situations where we may share information we have collected about you with third parties. For example, when you approve a third party to access your profile. This includes Personal Information as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. We do not share Personal Information collected through the Service with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We also may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Requested Third Parties:</strong> Our service may present options to receive certain information or marketing from third parties. You may also have us send (or give access to) certain information to third parties. If you choose to do so, your Personal Information and other information may be disclosed to those third parties. All information you disclose will be subject to the third-party privacy policies and practices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service. A few examples include hosting the Service, analytics, and other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Device Identifiers and Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us. Third-party analytics services providers such as Google Analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them, nor are we responsible for the effectiveness of or compliance with any third parties' opt-out options. We are not responsible for those third party technologies or activities arising out of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may also disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: (i) protect or defend the rights, safety or property of Robin or third parties (including through the enforcement of this Policy, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, and other applicable agreements and policies); or (ii) comply with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., pursuant to law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or court orders). To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we have complete discretion in electing to make or not make such disclosures, and to contest or not contest requests for such disclosures, without notice to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share your Personal Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates ("Affiliates"). We also reserve the right to disclose and transfer all such information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Service or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including, during the course of any due diligence process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your use:</strong> The Service may permit you to submit ideas, photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, "User Content"), particularly as part of your profile. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that Company does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Service or what others do with information you share with them on the Service. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the Service.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Third party content and services</h3>
<p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you click on a link, the click may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party websites and exercise caution in connection with them.</p>
<h3>Changing information and communication preferences</h3>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes by contacting us here. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records). Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for Robin's administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails or in some cases by logging into your Service account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails the opt-out will be so limited. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.</p>
<hr>

If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States.
