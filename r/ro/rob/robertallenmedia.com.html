	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Last updated November, 2005</p>

<p>OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY. <br>
We realize the sensitive nature of the information you provide to us. This site describes how we collect and use your personal information.  The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Robert Allen Media ("Company") are discussed in this policy. This policy applies to Company's information collection (a) on the Company's websites, (b) on various third-party websites, and (c) to Company's other information collection practices, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. </p>

<p>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>

<p>1.1 Survey Information. The Company collects information from individuals when they voluntarily complete a Company survey, order form, or registration page either online, in person, by mail, by telephone or other similar means (collectively, a "Survey"). In Surveys, the Company or third-party may ask an individual to provide various information to the Company, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). An individual may receive incentives from the Company or a third-party in exchange for providing Survey Information to the Company.  If a login or password is generated, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your information and password.  </p>

<p>1.2 Third-Party List Information. The Company may collect information from individuals when they provide information to a third-party, and the Company subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third-party ("Third-Party Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, Survey information ("Third-Party Survey Information").  When acquiring Third-Party Survey Information, the Company seeks assurances from the Third-Party Seller that the Third-Party Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party Survey Information to the Company and that the Third-Party Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals included on the Third-Party Seller's list. </p>

<p>1.3 Other Information. The Company may obtain other information in situations including, but not limited to (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by the Company or by a third-party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Company's or affiliate customer service department, or (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Company service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").  The Company may also receive information about individuals from third-parties or from other sources outside of the Company including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").</p> 

<p>1.4 Cookies, Web bugs, and Other Technology. The Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.  This information includes but is not limited to your IP address, the date and time you access the site, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser your are using and which operating system you are using.  Additionally, the Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").  As a result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>

<p>(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Company to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Company's database. We may use cookie technology to improve your experience, remember your preferences, customize the content you see, or authenticate our access to your personal information.  You may read more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use our Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>

<p>(b) Web bugs. A web bug, web beacon, or action tag is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see www.w3.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.  The Company currently contracts with online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications.  It uses the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how visitors use its site.  To do this, it uses web beacons and cookies provided by its marketing company on this site.  The type of information it collects includes the frequency, duration, and pages viewed by visitors, and the time on a page, their operating system, browser size, type, version and connection speed.  By supplementing its records, this information helps it learn things like what pages are most attractive to its visitors, which of its products most interest its customers, and what kinds of offers its customers like to see.  Although the marketing company logs the information coming from its site on its behalf, the Company controls how that data may and may not be used.  If you do not want to help the Company learn how to improve its site, product, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of the website analysis tool by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@robertallenmedia.com">privacy@robertallenmedia.com</a>.  The Company may also use web bugs in email messages or newsletters. If you wish more information about web bugs, you may visit http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html</p>

<p>1.5 Individual Information. As used herein, "Individual Information" means Survey Information, Third-Party Survey Information, Other Information, Technology Information, Outside Information, and any other information the Company gathers or receives about individuals.</p>

<p>1.6 No Information Collected from Children. The Company's products and services do not solicit information or target information of any kind to children under the age of 13.  The Company will not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. It is possible by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under the age of 13.  If the Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, the Company has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Company has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").</p> 

<p>1.7 Credit Card Information. The Company may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Company. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Company, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. The Company will use the Credit Card Information for the purpose of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.  Credit Card Information is not included in the definition of "Individual Information" and is not shared with Third Parties.  Specific opt-in requirements for sharing of financial information under various state laws such as Vermont and New Mexico do not apply.</p>
