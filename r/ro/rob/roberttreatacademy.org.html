<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>At WildFireWeb, we take your privacy very seriously. We strive to
ensure that your private information remains private. This Privacy
Policy governs the manner in which the WildFireWeb web site collects,
uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users of this
Web Site. <br></p>
<p>WildFireWeb does NOT share the personal information of our customers
with third parties without the specific consent of the customer.</p>
<p>I. Privacy <br>WildFireWeb
provides many different services to it's visitors, members, and
customers. This policy states the company-wide Privacy Policy with
regard to data collection practices. <br><br>By visiting WildFireWeb,
becoming a registered member or customer of any service, or
participating in promotions, contests, etc. you hereby provide your
consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy, and are aware that our
policy may change over time as discussed below. Specifically, this
Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect new features, services and
options, and any changes on the use of personal information. Continued
use of WildFireWeb Services will indicate that you agree with any
changes. <br><br><br>II. Nature of Information Collected <br>There
are two types of information collected by WildFireWeb : (A) anonymous
and (B) personally identifiable information. The WildFireWeb Network's
collection practices regarding these two are discussed in greater
detail below. <br><br>A. Anonymous Information Collection <br>Anonymous
information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a
specific individual. As with visiting any web site, WildFireWeb
collects some basic information about your computer, including browser
type, operating system, IP address, Internet service provider and
geographic location. <br><br>B. Personally Identifiable Information <br>Personally
identifiable information can be used to directly identify an
individual. WildFireWeb requires personal information to be collected
in order to create your account. <br><br>III. Use of Cookies <br>WildFireWeb
uses cookies throughout our web sites. A cookie is simply a small data
file sent to your computer that identifies your computer to a specific
web site. It also collects anonymous information and tracks traffic
patterns. A cookie will not provide any personally identifiable
information about you, nor will it read data off of your hard drive, or
read cookie files created by other web sites. WildFireWeb uses the
information provided by a cookie for maintaining a persistent editing
session while you are logged in. <br><br>IV. Purposes for Which Information is Collected <br>WildFireWeb
tracks anonymous information to determine which pages are preferred
based on traffic to those areas and provide marketing information to
our advertisers and sponsors. This information is aggregated to provide
WildFireWeb with demographic and other statistical data that allows us
to assess how well our web site is performing.<br><br>The personal
information collected from our members and customers, or anyone that
submits their personal information, is used to create and maintain the
services requested. This includes corresponding with our members and
customers by e-mail, postal mail, or phone. This correspondence is for
the purpose of keeping our members and customers up to date with
important system announcements and updates, and also for offering
relevant third party opportunities via email. Unsubscribe procedures
from non-account maintenance notifications are posted at the bottom of
each email. <br><br><br>V. Sharing of Information Collected byWildFireWeb <br>WildFireWeb
does NOT share the personal information of our customers with third
parties without the specific consent of the customer. <br><br>WildFireWeb
will cooperate, as appropriate, with police, judicial and other law
enforcement agencies and disclose personal information and data upon
receipt of the appropriate court orders. WildFireWeb reserves the right
in the absence of a court order, to release information concerning a
member or customer who WildFireWeb believes is using WildFireWeb
services for illegal activities. <br><br>VI. Links to Third Parties <br>WildFireWeb's
web sites contain links to other web sites. When accessing the web
sites of third parties, including through ad banners and other links,
you will be accessing sites that are not operated or controlled by
WildFireWeb . These sites may collect anonymous and personal
information by various methods, including the use of cookies. The
privacy policies of these web sites may not be the same as those of
WildFireWeb and may not afford visitors and citizens the same level of
protection. Visitors and citizens should contact these advertisers to
verify the privacy policies of these web sites and their terms of use
when accessing them and prior to providing any anonymous or personal
information. <br><br>VII. Storage and Security <br>Data
collected by WildFireWeb is stored in secure servers located in the
United Sates. WildFireWeb has security procedures in place to protect
the loss, misuse or alteration of information under its control. These
security measures include the necessary protection to prevent, as far
as possible, access to WildFireWeb databases to parties other than
WildFireWeb . The utmost care is maintained to ensure your personal
information is not at risk. <br><br>VIII. Review, Correction of Information and Deactivation of Membership <br>Customers
and Members who have submitted personal information may, at any time,
review the information relating to them contained in WildFireWeb
databases and edit any incorrect information. To review the information
follow the instructions provided within your account. <br><br>A member
or customer may decide at any time to terminate his/her relationship
with WildFireWeb . Upon termination personal information is removed
from WildFireWeb's databases. Please be advised that because of
backups, and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete all
information about a customer without some residual information still
remaining. <br><br>IX. Protection of Minors <br>The
protection of children's online privacy is very important to The
WildFireWeb Network. For that reason, it is our policy not to collect
or maintain information at our web sites from those we actually know
are under 13 and no part of our web sites is structured to attract
anyone under 13. <br></p>
