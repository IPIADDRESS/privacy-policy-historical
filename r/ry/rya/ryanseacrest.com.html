Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the online community free from bad actors, RSP will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except if RSP believes in good faith that the disclosure of PII is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity. <br>
