<a name="wni"></a>


<h2>5. Web Site Navigational Information</h2>
<p><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>Rypple’s Web site uses cookies to track Web site usage, to enable you to sign in to the Rypple
Services, and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is
placed on your hard disk through your Web browser via a Web server. It contains information
about you that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Cookies allow Rypple to recognize you as a visitor or user when you return to our Web site or
use the Services using the same computer and Web browser. Rypple uses cookies to store your
preferences so that you do not have to repeatedly enter the same information, and to display your
personalized content. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
modify your browser setting to decline cookies or configure acceptance of cookies. If you
choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use all of the interactive features of
the Rypple Web site or the Rypple Services that depend on cookies.</p>
<p>We, and our third party partners, use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent
cookie is set once you’ve logged in to the Rypple Services and remains on your hard drive
for an extended period of time. The next time you attempt to login to the Rypple Services, the
persistent cookie allows us to recognize you as an existing user so that you do not need to log in
to the Rypple Services again. If you log out of the Rypple Services, however, you will need to
re-enter your password the next time you wish to access your account. A session cookie is used
to enhance or customize a particular visit to the Rypple site. Session cookies expire after a short
time or when you close your Web browser.</p>
<p>We employ, or our third party advertising partner employs, clear gifs (also known as Web
beacons). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that, like cookies, track the online
movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, clear gifs are embedded on Web pages and are
about the size of a pixel. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to certain Data About
Rypple Customers in order to assess the effectiveness of our content. In particular, we use
clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which email alerts have been opened by
recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing
campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Rypple may also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and
other Web Site Navigational Information on Rypple’s Web site, emails, and on third-party Web
sites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational
Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this
information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests.
You may see these advertisements on other Web sites. This process also helps us manage and
track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn more about these and other advertising
networks and their opt-out instructions, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses and URLs</strong></p>
<p>Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use Rypple’s Web site, we
automatically receive the URL of the Web site from which you came and the Web site to which
you go when you leave Rypple’s Web site. We also receive your computer’s Internet Protocol
(IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer
operating system, the type of Web browser you are using, and your Internet Service Provider
(ISP). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Rypple Service.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses and URLs</strong></p>
<p>Rypple may collect aggregated data regarding use of the Rypple Services, including, without
limitation, number of visitors to the Web site, frequency and patterns of use, tag usage, feedback
request trends, etc. ("Aggregated Data"). Rypple uses Aggregated Data as a statistical measure
and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregated Data enables us to determine
how often certain parts of Rypple’s Web site or the Rypple Services are used so that we can
improve them. Rypple may make use of, or make such Aggregated Data available to, third
parties, in any manner in our sole discretion.</p>

<h2>6. Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials</h2>
<p><strong>Public Forums</strong></p>
<p>Rypple may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on Rypple’s Web site. Any
information you choose to submit in such forums may be read, collected, or used by others who
visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Rypple is not responsible
for the information you choose to submit to these forums.</p>
<p>To request removal of your information from such forums, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@rypple.com">privacy@rypple.com</a>.

records.</p>
