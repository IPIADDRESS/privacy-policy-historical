            <li>the referring URL, if any, and</li>
            <li>the browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of your browser software).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>3.2. Rypple may track the domains from which people visit the website, but Rypple cannot see a user's zip code, postal code, city or country unless the user chooses to explicitly provide this information.</p>
