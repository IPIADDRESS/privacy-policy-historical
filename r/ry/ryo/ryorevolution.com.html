				<h1>RYO Revolution Privacy Policy</h1>
			</div>
			<b>Scope</b> <br>
			<br>
			<u>The Collection and Use of Information</u> <br>
			<br>
			RYO Revolution collects information from you under the following two circumstances: 
				<ul>
					<li>Information Collected Automatically - Some information is collected from you automatically when you 
						view RYO Revolution pages and download information. This may include your Internet Protocol address 
						assigned by your Internet Service Provider, domain name and the type of browser and operating system 
						you used, the date and time you accessed RYO Revolution's site, the pages you requested and visited, 
						and the site you linked from to reach RYO Revolution. RYO Revolution uses this type of information to 
						statistically measure site traffic and to improve the web site. The information is not reviewed on an 
						individual basis but is aggregated with other users for comparison purposes.</li>
					<li>Information Voluntarily Submitted - Additional information may be collected from you if you opt-in or 
						voluntarily provide it in order to: 
						<ol>
							<li>fulfill a request for on-line services or</li>
							<li>choose to personalize the site (register for a RYO Revolution forum account).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ul>
			RYO Revolution uses the information you voluntarily provide to tailor our site to your needs and preferences and 
			to provide the on-line services you are requesting. The type of information we collect will vary with the service 
			being sought. To register a forum account requires that you provide a user name, valid e-mail address and verification 
			that you are at least 18 years old. If you simply wish to view pages on RYO Revolution's site or forums you Do Not need 
			to personalize the site by registering for an account. <br>
			<br>
			<u>Cookies</u> <br>
			<br>
			In order to customize your browsing experience, RYO Revolution uses "cookies". Cookies allow information to change as 
			you navigate through the pages of a web site. Two types of cookies can be used, "session-only" and "persistent".

					<li>If you wish to access the site or forums but do not want to personalize the forums, RYO Revolution uses 
						session-only cookies to reserve some storage on your computer in order to take your query and pass it 
						along to the page that will serve up the information you request. The session-only cookies are erased 
						either during web browser operation or after your web browser is shut down.</li>
					<li>If you choose to register with RYO Revolution to personalize the forum to your preferences but do not wish 
						to be remembered, RYO Revolution uses session cookies that are destroyed when you close your browser.</li>
					<li>If you choose to register with RYO Revolution to personalize the forums and wish to be remembered, 
						RYO Revolution uses permanent cookies that remain on your computer's hard drive as small text files. 
						These permanent cookies allow RYO Revolution to recognize you when you return to our site. When you 
						register with RYO Revolution, we ask you to identify yourself by your user name and email address. 
						This allows RYO Revolution to customize the presentation of information for you based upon what you 
						have asked for and/or voluntarily provided during previous visits. RYO Revolution only uses permanent 
						cookies with the permission of the user.</li>
					<li>RYO Revolution also uses 3rd party advertisers to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies 
						may use information cookies to track your visits to this and other websites in order to provide 
						advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you wish to opt out of the DART cookie 
						used by the Google adsense program or read more about Google's advertising and privacy policies, 
						you can do so <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" title="Google advertising and privacy policy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			RYO Revolution has links to other web sites outside of our site. When you link to one of these sites, RYO Revolution 
			cannot control their use of cookies and this privacy policy will not apply. <br>
			<br>
			If you choose to do so, you can configure your browser to notify you when a new cookie is received. You can also 
			prevent your browser from accepting any new cookies, view and delete existing cookies or disable cookies altogether.<br>

					<li>we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have specifically requested; or</li>
					<li>we are compelled to do so by law (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, or to 
						requests pursuant to a statute requiring disclosure).</li>
