<p><small>Revised January, 2004<br>
Policy-Procedure<br>
Supercedes version dated January, 2002</small></p>



<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
To develop within the University community an appreciation for the value,
and often vulnerable nature of the information asset and to reduce the risk
of misuse, destruction or loss of information without restricting academic
freedom or complicating access to information for which the University
community has a legitimate and specific need.</p>

<p><strong>Application and Scope</strong><br>
This policy extends to the whole of the University community. It directs
that the information be used in a manner that maintains an appropriate level
of confidentiality and that provides sufficient assurance of its integrity
in compliance with existing laws and obligations. While the elimination of
all risk is impossible, the goal of the policy is to minimize the
possibility of information misuse, corruption, and loss through the adoption
of reasonable procedures for the University community to follow.</p>

<p>While this policy is especially pertinent to information stored
electronically, it is also intended to guide users of all information,
including that which is stored in other formats, such as paper, microfilm,
and video, as well as the content of confidential meetings and conversations.</p>


<br><h3>POLICY</h3>
<h3><a name="Access">Access Guidelines</a></h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection:</strong> 
Ryerson's Board of Governors has approved the Council of Ontario Universities 
(COU) guidelines with respect to information access and protection of privacy 
for application within the community. Refer to Freedom of Information and 
Privacy Protection Guidelines. Please ask your director, chair, manager, 
or supervisor to see a copy of the Guidelines.</li>

<li><strong>Public Information:</strong> 
The vast majority of information at the University
is of a public nature, for example: telephone directories, calendars,
schedules, library books in general circulation, most conversations and
meetings, and information bulletins. Access to public information is limited
by such restrictions as circulation policies, copyright restrictions,
license and contractual agreements, University policies, (such as the
Student Information: Collection, Dissemination and Confidentiality), and
procedures for use.</li>

<li><strong>Restricted Information:</strong> 
Information of a restricted or legally
constrained nature, such as that protected by federal and provincial laws on
rights and privacy, should only be accessed by those authorized members of
the University community with a specific and legitimate need. Legitimate
access does not include the freedom to search for information beyond that
specifically required to perform a job-related task or authorized research.</li>

<li>Appropriate use is defined as wise and prudent use of information so
that resources are not wasted, damaged, or corrupted. Inappropriate use
includes erasing or modifying information without proper authorization,
defacing or removing pages from books, using information to embarrass,

as purposefully attempting to crash or slow down computer systems, modifying
