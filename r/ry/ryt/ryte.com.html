<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="small" style="margin-bottom:3em">Please note: The <a href="https://de.ryte.com/about/privacy/" title="" target="_blank">German Privacy Policy</a> is binding.</p>

<p>Data Protection Declaration</p><p>We are pleased that you are visiting our website and show an interest in our company. We take the protection of your personal data seriously and want to ensure that you feel secure and enjoy visiting our internet pages.<br><br><strong>1. General</strong><br>You agree to the German Privacy Policy which has been translated to English for your convenience only. The German Privacy Policy is binding.<br>Ryte GmbH places the highest significance on the protection of the privacy of its users. This applies particularly to the processing of personal data. You don’t have to reveal personal data when using our website. In certain cases we do, however, need your name and address as well as further data in order to process your order. Where this is needed we will point this out to you as appropriate. In addition, we will only store and process data which you have voluntarily or automatically provided us with. <br><br><strong>2. Acquisition and Processing</strong><br>Every access to our website and all calling up of underlying data are recorded. These include: the data names of called-up data and the date and time of the call, the volume of data transmitted, notification of successful call-ups and the web browser and domain of the enquirer. This recording is for internal statistical reasons. The IP addresses of the computers from which the requests were issued are also recorded. Going forward, personal data will only be stored if you have given it freely in connection with a question, an order or registration.<br><br><strong>3. Usage and Transmission</strong><br>We will handle the personal data you revealed confidentially and only reveal it to third parties if required by order processing, for example by passing order data to deliverers. In no case would we sell or rent your personal data or data that could be linked to you to third parties for them to use. Personal data will only be used to process your orders, to answer your questions and for internal compilation of anonymized statistics. The only exceptions will consist of services ordered by you which will include your consent to the further use of data you provided and by the relaying of data to public institutions and authorities as required by law. We will, with your agreement, pass your compiled and stored data to our business partners under the aegis of contractual agreements, insofar as it is necessary in your interests. Of course, our business partners are called upon and obliged to comply with legal data protection regulations.<br>We will identify any advertising for other organizations on our Internet site insofar as we advertise them. According to the court decision of 12th May 1998, “Liability for Links” (312 O 85/98), the Hamburg district court clearly decided that an organization, by installing a link, becomes jointly responsible for, which means liable for, the contents of the linked site; this can only be prevented if the linking organization clearly distances itself from these contents which Ryte GmbH hereby does.<br>Ryte GmbH will not transmit data to non-EU states without your agreement except where it is necessary for transaction processing and is explicitly allowed by the BDSG.<br><br><strong>4. Your Rights and Choices</strong><br>You can access, rectify, erase, restrict or export your personal information at any time by emailing us at info@ryte.com or by post:<br>Ryte GmbH<br>Geschäftsleitung<br>Paul-Heyse-Straße 27<br>80336 München<br><br>You can object to our processing of your personal information at any time. Contact our Data Protection Officer with requests or concerns<br><br>Mr Stefan Eisert<br>SEDC<br>Magdalenenweg 12<br>85457 Wörth<br>Tel.: 08123 928639<br>Mobile: 0173 481 6006<br>sedc1@web.de<br><br>Of course, if you are affected, you can also turn to the regional office for data protection control:<br><br>BayLDA<br>Promenade 27<br>91522 Ansbach<br>Tel: 0981 531300<br>poststelle@lda.bayern.de<br><br>You have the right to have data we have collected either with your permission or automatically while fulfilling a contract, in an established, machine-readable format, sent to you or third party. If you have asked for the transmission of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent it is technically feasible.</p><p>Stored personal data will be deleted if the website user and/or customer cancels their permission for it to be stored or if their knowledge is no longer necessary for the fulfilment of whatever purpose caused them to be stored or if their storage becomes impermissible for other legal reasons. Data needed for calculation of invoices or for book-keeping reasons are unaffected by this.</p><p><strong>5. Usage of Cookies</strong><br>In order to make your visit to our website more appealing and to enable the use of certain features, we employ so-called cookies on several sites. In so doing, small text files are deposited on your terminal device. Some of the cookies employed by us will be deleted after finishing your browser session, hence closing your browser (so-called Session Cookies). Other cookies will remain on your device and enable us or our business partners to recognize your browser on your next visit (Persistent Cookies). You can adjust your browser in order to notify you about the setting of new cookies and decide whether to accept cookies for certain cases or to generally decline them. With declining cookies, our website’s functionality can be limited.<br><br><strong>6. Usage of third party tools</strong><br>In the following section you can find all third party tools Ryte uses.<br>a) Google<br>Unless otherwise stated in this privacy policy, the operator of all Google services mentioned here is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).<br><br><strong>i) Google Tag Manager</strong><br>This website uses the “Google Tag Manager” service. The Tag Manager is a tool for the management of so-called tags, which are used for tracking in online marketing. The Tag Manager itself does not process any personal data, since it is purely for the administration of other services - e.g. Google Analytics, etc. -.<br>For more information about the Tag Manager, please visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/use-policy/" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.<br><br><strong>ii) Google Analytics</strong><br>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics tool of the Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, text files which are being stored on your computer and enable the analysis of your usage of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your usage of the website is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. In case of activated IP anonymization on this website, Google will however shorten your IP address within EU member states or other contracting states of the European Economic Area Agreement.<br>Only on rare occasions, the entire IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information to analyze your usage of the website in order to compose reports about the website activities and to perform further services related to the website and web usage towards the website operator. The transfer of your IP address for the purposes of Google Analytics won’t be merged with other Google data.<br>You can prevent your browser software from storing cookies with a respective change of settings; we however point to the fact that in this case you may not be able to use all features of this website to its full extent. Moreover, you can prevent the assessment of the data generated by the cookie and related to your usage of the website (including your IP address) as well as Google processing this data with downloading and installing the following browser Plug-In retrievable from <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a><br><br><strong>iii) Google+ Plug-Ins (e.g. “+1” button)</strong><br>Our website uses so-called Social Plug-Ins (“Plug-Ins”) of the social network Google+. The Plug-Ins are e.g. recognizable from buttons with “+1” on blank or colored background. Please find an overview of the Google Plug-Ins and their appearance here: https://developers.google.com/+/plugins.<br>If you click on sites of our website containing such Plug-Ins, your browser automatically establishes a connection with the Google servers. Google will transfer the content of the Plug-In directly to your browser and integrate it into the site. With that integration, Google receives the information that your browser has called the respective site of our website, even if you don’t have a Google+ profile or are not logged into Google+. This information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser directly to a Google server in the USA and stored there.<br>If you are logged into Google+, Google can directly correlate your visit of our website with your Google+ profile. If you interact with the Plug-Ins, for instance clicking the “+1” button, the respective information will also be directly sent to a Google server and stored there. Moreover, the information will be published on Google+ and available for your contacts.<br>For sense and purpose of the data assessment and further processing and use of your data through Google as well as rights concerning this matter and the setup of the protection of your privacy, please refer to the Google privacy policy: https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy<br>If you don’t want Google to instantly correlate the information gathered on our website with your Google+ profile, you need to log out from Google+ before visiting our website. You can also completely prevent loading Google Plug-Ins with Add-Ons for your browser, e.g. with “NoScript” (<a href="https://noscript.net/" target="_blank">https://noscript.net/</a>).<br><br><br><strong>iv) Google AdWords</strong><br>Ryte uses the “Google AdWords” service. This service has the purpose of so-called 'conversion tracking', i.e. we can see what happened after you have clicked on one of our ads. Cookies are used for this purpose, which have a limited validity and do not contain any personal data. Personal identification of the user is therefore not possible.<br><br>Our legitimate interest in using this service is to analyze and optimize the operation of our website.<br><br><strong>v) Doubleclick by Google</strong><br>This website uses the “Doubleclick by Google” service. This service uses cookies to show you advertisements relevant to you. This is done by means of a pseudonymous identification number (pID) which your browser receives and is assigned to it. With this pID the service can recognize which displays have already been displayed and which have been called. The cookies used do not contain any personal data. Rather, the cookies serve a cross website placement of advertisements by enabling Google to identify the pages visited. The information generated by the cookies is transmitted by Google to a server in the USA for analysis and stored there. A transfer of data by Google to third parties only takes place due to legal regulations or within the scope of order data processing. Under no circumstances will Google match your data with other data collected by Google.<br><br>By using our website, you consent to your data being processed by Google in accordance with the description and purposes set out above. You can prevent the use of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. However, such an attitude can lead to the fact that the website cannot be used without restrictions.<br>Google is <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">Privacy Shield certified</a>.<br><br><strong>b) Twitter</strong><br>Our website uses so-called Social Plug-Ins (“Plug-Ins”) of the micro blogging platform Twitter, which is being operated from the Twitter Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (“twitter”). The Plug-Ins are marked with a Twitter logo, e.g. in form of the blue “Twitter bird”. Please find an overview of the Twitter Plug-Ins and their appearance <a href="https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>If you click on sites of our website containing such Plug-Ins, your browser automatically establishes a connection with the Twitter servers. Twitter will transfer the content of the Plug-In directly to your browser and integrate it into the site. With that integration, Twitter receives the information that your browser has called the respective site of our website, even if you don’t have a Twitter profile or are not logged into Twitter. This information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser directly to a Twitter server in the USA and stored there.<br>If you are logged into Twitter, Twitter can directly correlate your visit of our website with your Twitter profile. If you interact with the Plug-Ins, for instance clicking the “Tweet” button, the respective information will also be directly sent to a Twitter server and stored there. Moreover, the information will be published in your Twitter account and available for your contacts.<br>For sense and purpose of the data assessment and further processing and use of your data through Twitter as well as rights concerning this matter and the setup of the protection of your privacy, please refer to the Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.<br><br>If you don’t want Twitter to instantly correlate the information gathered on our website with your Twitter profile, you need to log out from Twitter before visiting our website.
