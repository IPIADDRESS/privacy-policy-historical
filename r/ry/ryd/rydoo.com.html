<p style="text-align: left;">Rydoo N.V. and iAlbatros Poland Sp.Zo.o and their local subsidiaries provide business process outsourcing services in the areas of travel and expense management using modern technology solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our expense management services allow the client to capture, track and store his business expenditure receipts, as well as to generate and submit for approval the expense reports derived from those receipts, which are uploaded via either web, e-mail and/or mobile applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our travel management services allow the client to use our web pages, mobile applications, call center, integrated partner applications, instant messaging and social media platforms. This policy applies to all the platforms you can use to get access to our services and all the data we collect using those platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This policy may change when the applicable legislation changes or if we decide to extend our services. Please visit this page regularly to be kept up-to-date.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, we kindly advise you to stop using our services.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What kind of information we collect</h3>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Information provided by you or your employer</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on the services you or your employer has selected, we collect some specific information about you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To provide you with the best available accommodation, flight or rail ticket we need to know certain things about you, like your first name, last name, ID document number, contact details, other travelers’ data; sometimes also your date of birth can be asked, in order to process the booking.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In order to perform our expense management services, we may also receive and store the following information about you: your bank account number, scanned expense receipts and credit card statements, which may include personal data such as name, address and bank account information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Use of our services does not always require users to fill in or upload&nbsp;sensitive personal data. In order to avoid unnecessary exposure, we ask you to make sure that sensitive personal data are not filled in or uploaded to your account (intentionally or accidentally) in any form as photos, notes or other if it is not necessary.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: left;">Information we collect automatically when you use our services</h5>

<h5 style="text-align: left;">Information from other sources</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you use a third party payment provider, if you link your profile with social media or instant messaging profile or if you use our platform via third party integrated software we can collect information from those sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All our accommodation and transport services providers may also share with us information about you and your trip.</p>

By providing us with your friend’s name and email address, you warrant that your friend consents to such contact.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What is the purpose of data collection</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">We need our users and travelers’ data to provide our services to them: searching for hotels and rates available, booking rooms or tickets, managing expenses, creating and transmitting expense reports or any other service we provide and to improve our services for our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also use your contact information to inform you about any changes to trip itineraries, any actions waiting for you in the system or any new features and services available.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Why do we put the deadline on 6 months after the end of the year of termination of the purpose?

These logs and backups are deleted within a period of 6 months.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (also called the GDPR), the EU’s legal instrument to strengthen and unify data protection laws for all individuals within the European Union, has come into full effect on May 25th, 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How is Rydoo dealing with GDPR?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since GDPR was adopted back in April 2016, we haven’t stood still really. Only a couple of weeks later, a gap analysis was performed and a roadmap towards full compliance was drafted. This journey has now come to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is a brief overview what we have been occupied within the past months and years:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Thorough researching the areas of our business impacted by GDPR</li>
<li>Updating our internal policies and procedures to reflect the GPDR requirements and implementing them step by step</li>
<li>Reassessing our partnerships with third parties</li>
<li>Creating awareness among our employees through training sessions</li>
<li>Drafting and rewriting our Data Processing Agreement</li>
<li>Updating our Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Appointing a Data Protection Officer</li>
<li>Thoroughly testing all of our changes to verify and validate compliance with GDPR</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rydoo does not require the end user to fill in or upload any high security personal data, such as credit card number or pin code, social security, health insurance or driver license numbers on the platform. Even so, we want to do the utmost for your data to be sure it’s safe with us. Therefore, Rydoo is also working closely with different external attorneys and IT security experts on its approach, because we want to make sure every aspect is covered.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What is GDPR actually? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The General Data Protection Regulation, which replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive, regulates the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU. Under GDPR, “personal data” is interpreted broadly and covers any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual (the so-called “data subject”).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The GDPR gives data subjects more rights and control over their data by regulating how companies should handle and store the personal data they collect from them. The GDPR also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines should the provisions of the GDPR be breached.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To give you an idea of some important changes that will come into effect when GDPR enters into force:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">–&nbsp;<strong>More rights for individuals</strong>: The GDPR extends the rights for individuals in the European Union by granting them, amongst other things, the right to access their personal information and the right to be forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">–&nbsp;<strong>Compliance obligations:</strong>&nbsp;The GDPR also requires organizations to implement appropriate policies and security protocols, conduct privacy impact assessments, keep detailed records on their processing activities and enter into written agreements with vendors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">–&nbsp;<strong>Data breach notification and security:</strong>&nbsp;The GDPR creates new obligations to report certain data breaches to data protection authorities, and under certain circumstances, to the affected data subjects. The GDPR also places additional security requirements on organizations.</p>

<div class="col-12">
<div class="section-intro">
<div class="p-intro"><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rydoo’s Subprocessors</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rydoo uses carefully selected subprocessors (including third parties, as listed below), subcontractors and content delivery networks to assist it in providing the Rydoo Services as described in our Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Subprocessor?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subprocessor is a third party data processor engaged by Rydoo, including Rydoo’s sister companies, who has or potentially will have access to or process Client’s Data (which may contain Personal Data). In the following sections we will explain which subprocessors we use and what types of activities they perform. We also mention some of our sub-contractors who in principle do not get access to Personal Data but rarely and incidentally might do so. As a precaution, we have taken the necessary measures and safeguards to make sure that everyone’s personal data is properly taken care of such as signing Data Processing Agreements and EU Standard Contractual Clauses with them.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we choose a Subprocessor?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a careful selection process where we take into consideration the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of proposed subprocessors that will or may have access to or otherwise process Personal Data. We will not select any subprocessor that cannot guarantee to provide the very same level of Data Protection as Rydoo.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contractual Safeguards</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our sub-processors need to comply with equivalent obligations as those required from Rydoo (as a Data Processor) as set forth in Rydoo’s Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”), including but not limited to the requirements to:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only collect, process and use the types of personal data relating to the categories of data subjects for the purposes of providing the Rydoo Services under the Contract and for the specific purposes required in each case.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In connection with their subprocessing activities, use only personnel who are reliable and subject to a contractually binding obligation to observe data privacy, confidentiality and security, to the extent applicable, as established in Data Protection Laws.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide regular training in security and data protection to personnel to whom they grant access to Personal Data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures (including measures consistent with those to which Rydoo is contractually committed to adhere to) and provide evidence of compliance with this obligation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promptly inform Rydoo about any actual or potential security breach.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooperate with Rydoo in order to deal with requests from data controllers, data subjects or data protection authorities, as applicable.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will happen if we engage a new SubProcessor:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Clients will be notified of any changes on this page. If the Client has a reasonable objection to any new or replacement Subprocessor, it shall notify Rydoo of such objections in writing within ten (10) days of the notification and the parties will seek to resolve the matter in good faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Rydoo is reasonably able to provide the Rydoo Services to the Client in accordance with the Main Agreement without using the sub-processor and decides in its discretion to do so, then the Client will have no further rights under this provision in respect of the proposed use of the sub-processor. If Rydoo requires use of the Subprocessor in its discretion, it shall seek to satisfy the Client as to the suitability of the Subprocessor or the documentation and protections in place between Rydoo and the Subprocessor in a period not exceeding ninety (90) days from the Cient’s notification of objections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Client does not provide a timely objection to any new or replacement Subprocessor in accordance with this procedure, the Client will be deemed to have consented to the sub-processor and waived its right to object. Rydoo may use a new or replacement Subprocessor whilst the objection procedure in this section is in process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termination rights, as applicable and agreed, are set forth exclusively the Contract.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is an up-to-date list (as of the date of this policy) of the names and locations of Rydoo’s Subprocessors, subcontractors and content delivery networks:</span></p>
