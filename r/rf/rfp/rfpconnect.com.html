We will  work with members to obtain a fair and rapid resolution of any complaints or  disputes about privacy.</p>
		<p>  <strong>FinancialIt.Net's Privacy Policy Details</strong></p>
		<p>  <strong>Openness</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  fully discloses our privacy policy and information practices. We describe in  detail what member information we collect, how we use it, and how we disclose  it. As FinancialIt.Net evolves and offers new services, this policy will be  updated to reflect the changes. However, our strong commitment to privacy,  security, and fair information practices will never change. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Information  collection from members</strong> </p>
		<ul type="disc">
		<li><strong>Registration:</strong> </li>
		</ul>
		<p>The basic  way that FinancialIt.Net obtains information about a member is through the  registration process. When you register, you are asked to provide certain  personal information. You also select a FinancialIt.Net user ID and password.  You can opt-out of receiving email from FinancialIt.Net that you do not want. </p>
		<ul type="disc">
		<li><strong>Surveys:</strong> </li>
		</ul>
		<p>FinancialIt.Net  may occasionally ask members and visitors to complete surveys and opinion polls  about their interests, needs, and attitudes. Surveys help us provide better  services that meet member needs. Participation is completely voluntary. We do  not use any survey information in individually identifiable form. Once you  complete a survey, any links between your identity and your answers are broken  as quickly as possible. All information provided through surveys is only used  in an aggregate way. Individual survey responses are never used or disclosed in  any other way.</p>
		<p>    <strong>Information  collection from visitors</strong> </p>
		<p>  If you are  just visiting the FinancialIt.Net website, we do not normally collect any  information about you except through web logs (see below). However, if you fill  out a web form, send us an email, or choose to share information with us in any  other way, we will have the information that you provided and will use it to  respond to your inquiry or to fulfill your request if we can. We do not  routinely share any of this information with anyone else unless appropriate to  respond to your request. If you receive email from FinancialIt.Net that you no  longer want to receive, you can ask us to stop by sending a request to <a href="mailto:info@financialit.net">info@financialit.net</a></p>
		<p>  <strong>Weblogs</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  maintains standard web logs that automatically record basic information about  everyone who visits our website. These logs contain: </p>
		<ul type="disc">
		<li>The Internet domain from which       you access FinancialIt.Net (e.g., aol.com, xyz.edu).</li>
		<li>Your IP address. Your computer       is automatically assigned an IP address when you surf the Internet. Static       IP addresses are potentially identifiable, but dynamic addresses are       usually not identifiable.</li>
		<li>The type of browser (e.g.,       Internet Explorer or Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows XP, Mac       OS X) you use. </li>
		<li>The date and time you visited FinancialIt.Net.</li>
		<li>The pages that you visited       here. </li>
		<li>The address of the website you       linked here from. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>FinancialIt.Net  uses web log information to help us design our website, to identify popular  features, and for other managerial purposes. We do not normally make any  attempt to identify individuals from web logs. However, web logs may be used if  necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our  website. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we  believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related  laws.</p>
		<p>    <strong>Partner  Privacy Standards</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  contracts with other companies to assist in supporting our core features and  functions. When necessary for these services to function, we exchange member  information with these companies or those members who have selected those  services. We require that our key partners treat our members' data under the  same high privacy and security standards that FinancialIt.Net uses. This means  that personal information provided to our partners is not sold, rented, or  shared by them except as necessary to accomplish the purpose of the disclosure.  It also means that our partners will not use personal data for marketing to our  members. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Advertisers  and others</strong> </p>
		<p>  Through  advertisers, outside content providers, and marketing affiliates, FinancialIt.Net  offers members the opportunity to contact other companies to obtain information  or to buy products or services. FinancialIt.Net never shares any of your  individual information with these companies. It is up to you to decide when and  whether to give your personal information to these companies. If you provide  information, its use is governed by the policies and practices of these  companies and not by FinancialIt.Net's policies and practices. FinancialIt.Net  makes no representations or warranties about, and has no liability or  responsibility toward its members in connection with, any of these other  companies or their privacy policies. Once you click through to an unaffiliated  website, FinancialIt.Net privacy policies no longer apply. We strongly urge our  members to read the privacy policies of these other companies and their  websites. We collect personal and plan information to facilitate a leading edge  service development process, to provide you with a customized workplace  experience, and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the  appropriate audience. We do not, however, provide your personal information  directly to advertisers. All FinancialIt.Net employees, affiliates and alliance  partners must sign an agreement guaranteeing their strict adherence to this  privacy policy. We select partners who not only meet our standards for privacy  and security, but also embrace them. We will work with members to obtain a fair  and rapid resolution of any complaints or disputes about privacy. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Cookies</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  only uses so-called session cookies. These stay in your computer's memory as  long as you are logged on to our site. They are used to facilitate your  personal navigation through the site. These cookies are deleted entirely from  your computer when you log off of our Web site or when you close your Web  browser. Your browser probably allows you to control the use of cookies on your  computer. Browsers usually accept cookies unless you choose otherwise. You can  tell your browser to alert you when cookies are used or to disable or refuse  cookies. If you decide not to permit cookies on your computer, our Web site  will not function. If you click through to other websites, you will find that  many of these sites set their own cookies. FinancialIt.Net does not see or use  these cookies, and we do not control how other sites use cookies. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Privacy  policy changes and updates</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  will update this policy from time to time as we add new services and new  features. However, our strong commitment to privacy, security, and fair  information practices will never change. Changes on our website will require  additional descriptions about the flow of data. We will tell our users about  changes in this policy by making changes on this page, which will always  contain a version number and date, making it easy to see when changes have  taken place. You can also let us know here whether you want to be notified of  any changes to this policy through <a href="mailto:info@financialit.net">info@financialit.net</a> </p>
		<p>  <strong>Accuracy,  Access</strong> </p>
		<p>  We will tell  our users about changes in this policy by making changes on this page, which  will always contain a version number and date, making it easy to see when changes  have taken place. A member can terminate his or her service with FinancialIt.Net  at any time. When service is terminated, FinancialIt.Net will make every effort  to remove all information from our system and to stop sending email and  newsletters. Like other Internet and computer service organizations, FinancialIt.Net  maintains several types of backups to its records. The backups permit us to  restore service in the event of a natural disaster, equipment failure, or other  problem. Backups provide important protections for everyone because they lessen  the risk of loss of valuable data. Removing a member from our main files does  not remove that member's record from any of the backup systems. It may take  months before backup records are completely recycled and all traces of a  member's registration and related data are completely removed. Of course,  backup records remain subject to the same protections as other FinancialIt.Net  records.</p>
		<p>  <strong>Security </strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  maintains all personal data with appropriate and high-level physical,  electronic, and managerial safeguards to insure the security and  confidentiality of the data against foreseeable risks. Security is designed to  prevent unauthorized use, access, disclosure, destruction, and change of data. </p>
		<p>  <strong>FinancialIt.Net  security mission statement</strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  recognizes the value of and our dependency on the data, information, and  computer systems used in serving the needs of our members. As a part of  everyday business it is essential that this information and technical infrastructures  are secure from destruction, corruption, unauthorized access and breach of  confidentiality whether accidental or deliberate. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Physical  safeguards&nbsp; </strong> </p>
		<p>  Access to FinancialIt.Net  computing facilities, including servers, telecommunications equipment, the  network control center, and other related areas is restricted to individuals  identified by management who need access to perform their jobs. Access by  anyone else, including vendors, contractors, and other FinancialIt.Net employees  must be approved in advance by management. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Management  safeguards</strong> </p>
		<p>  Ultimately,  the responsibility for the success of an organization lies with management. FinancialIt.Net's  senior management team maintains a strong computer security program with  defined program goals, objectives, and priorities. Senior management is  committed to providing adequate resources for security, to making sure that  those resources are applied to security, and to doing whatever is necessary to  make sure that security is a successful part of the FinancialIt.Net operation. FinancialIt.Net  recognizes that security is an essential part of its computer system. We also  recognize that no one can guarantee complete and perfect security against every  possible hazard. We make every reasonable effort to provide high-level  security. This includes a continual review of security measures and plans, the  use of new technology when available and appropriate, and regular training for  our personnel. If you click through to another website offering products,  services, or content, any information that you disclose to that website will be  subject to the security policies of that website and not those of FinancialIt.Net.  Before you provide personal information to other companies, we encourage you to  read their security policies.</p>
		<p>  <strong>Disclosure </strong> </p>
		<p>  FinancialIt.Net  fully describes all sources, uses, and disclosures of FinancialIt.Net member  data. We do not collect, use, or disclose any information about our members  without their knowledge and approval. We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise  disclose our member lists or member information to third parties. We do not  share snail mail or email lists with anyone. FinancialIt.Net recognizes that the  information you provide is personal and valuable. FinancialIt.Net believes the  service we provide to our members should make their lives easier, without the  fear that their personal information will end up in the wrong hands. This  privacy policy describes the basic data disclosures that we make with our  partners in order to support our core functions and features. FinancialIt.Net  uses the information collected about you to assist you. We use personally  identifiable information about our members only in defined and responsible  ways. We use your information internally to respond to your requests, provide  support, maintain your account, and for similar purposes. We do not share user  information with third parties except when we have informed users about the  disclosures, when we have prior consent, or when required by law. We do not  share your personal information in individually identifiable form with  advertisers. Where FinancialIt.Net indicates that a part of our site is  presented in cooperation with a third party or sponsored by a third party, the  privacy policy of FinancialIt.Net remains valid. That third party does not have  access to your individual personal or plan information unless you expressly give  permission to share this information. The providers featuring their information  on sponsored pages do not know who visited these pages unless the visitor  volunteered that information. Some personal information maintained by FinancialIt.Net  may be used on occasion by outside auditors, consultants, and others hired by FinancialIt.Net  to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. We permit these  uses or disclosures only when necessary. All recipients must agree in writing  to safeguard personal information, to use it only for an authorized purpose,  and to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity. In addition, it  is possible that FinancialIt.Net could be required to disclose personal  information in response to valid legal process, such as a search warrant,  subpoena, or court order. All record keepers face the possibility that  disclosure of their records may be compelled in some civil, criminal, or  administrative matters. Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect FinancialIt.Net's  legal rights or during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at  risk. We think that these events are unlikely, but they are possible. We will  take reasonable steps to limit the scope and consequences of any of these  disclosures. If we receive a subpoena demanding disclosure of your records, we  will make all reasonable efforts to notify you of the subpoena when possible. </p>
		<p>  <strong>Accountability </strong> </p>
		<p>  All FinancialIt.Net  employees have to sign an agreement guaranteeing their adherence to this  policy. We will work with members to obtain a fair and rapid resolution of any  complaints or disputes about privacy. FinancialIt.Net is committed to protecting  your privacy and to making your online experience enjoyable, secure,  comfortable, and valuable. If you have a question or comment about FinancialIt.Net's  privacy policy, you may send a message to <a href="mailto:info@financialit.net">info@financialit.net</a>. If you have a  complaint or dispute about this privacy policy, please let us know immediately.  You can write to us at <a href="mailto:info@financialit.net">info@financialit.net</a>. We will do everything that we can  to resolve any problems that a member has identified. We will respond promptly  to all complaints and disputes, and we will inform members about their right to  appeal if we have been unable to resolve the problem.</p>
