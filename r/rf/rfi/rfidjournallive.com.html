<b>Revised Nov. 27, 2003<br>
</b><br>
RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University recognize the importance of 
protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our Web sites. 
We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our users' right to 
privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This privacy statement 
discloses the privacy practices for all our products and services, including 
but not limited to event-related Web sites.
<br>
<br>
<b>Information Collection And Use<br>
</b>RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University collect information from our Web 
site users and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will 
describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide 
better services to our customers.<br>
<br>
<b>Web Site Usage<br>
</b>You may visit the RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University Web sites 
without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 
As you use the site, the site collects a log file, the IP address of 
your computer, and other standard tracking data that we use to evaluate 
site traffic and usage patterns. This information is aggregated with 
tracking data from all site visitors and is used both to enable us to 
tailor content to the interests of visitors and to inform advertisers 
of the usage patterns and interests of our visitors.<br>
<br>
<b>Registering <br>
</b>Before attending our events, users must first register. 
During registration, users are required to give their contact 
information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). 
We also collect demographic information (such as job title and purchasing 
responsibilities, and company information). For internal purposes, we use 
this information to communicate with users and provide requested services.  
We may in certain instances share certain non-financial personal information 
in accordance with the policy described below under “With Whom 
Your Information is Shared.”  We use aggregate demographic 
information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing 
purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. The aggregated information 
does not include any personally identifiable data.  We also collect 
information in order to process payment for event registration. This 
financial information is stored for a limited period of time and is 
not shared with anyone other than the credit card processor.
<br>
<br>
<b>Surveys</b><br>
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys. 
Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user 
therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact information 
(such as name and mailing address) and demographic information (such as 
zip code or job title). We do not treat the information we collect through 
such surveys differently from any other comparable information that we 
receive through other means.  Please refer to the other sections of this 
policy for discussions of specific types of information.<br>
<br>
<b>Communications with Us<br>
</b>Our Web site contains certain features through which users can submit 
information to us. Requests for service, support or information may be 
forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain 
e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative 
purposes, and to help us to serve customers better. We may in certain 
instances share certain non-financial personal information in accordance 
with the policy described below under 
“With Whom Your Information is Shared.”  We do not share 
the actual correspondence.<br>
<br>
<b>Communications from Us<br>
</b>In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that 
contain important information about our sites, events and services. 
For example, we may communicate with a user to provide requested services, 
to communicate about an upcoming event and for account-related issues via 
e-mail, phone or regular mail. Should you wish to opt-out of future 
communication, see the section below on Choice/Opt-out.<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies<br>
</b>We use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's 
hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the 
user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our site. 
If users reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas 
of our site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of 
our users to enhance the experience on our sites.<br>
<br>
Some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. 
However, we have no access to or control over these business affiliates' 
cookies; we urge users to read the privacy policies on these sites for 
information regarding the treatment of their information and data.<br>
<br>
For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation 
history and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does 
not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this 
information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system 
administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user 
base for aggregate use.<br>
<br>
We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration
 with site usage data to provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally 
identifiable form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the 
site and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers 
and business affiliates to help them better understand our services.<br>
<br>
<b>Special Policy on Information Regarding Children </b>(persons under 13 years of age) <br>
The Site is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect 
any personal information from children. If you are concerned about your 
child's use of the site, you may use Web filtering technology to supervise 
or limit access to the site.<br>
<br>
<b>With Whom Your Information Is Shared<br>
</b>We do not share credit card or other financial information with third 
parties other than for use in processing your payments for goods or services. 
We do not share your personal information with our affiliates, partners or 
third parties other than in the aggregate with one exception. We may share 
email and postal addresses gathered from this web site with those partners or 
affiliates that we feel may offer products or services that may be of interest
 to our readers and event attendees.<br>
<br>
Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, RFID Journal Live! and 
RFID Journal University will keep your personal information and 
your financial information private and will not share it with third parties,
 unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other 
legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of 
service. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. 
Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances 
to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties 
without permission.<br>
<br>
We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, 
with others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it 
will not include personal information.<br>
<br>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information<br>
</b>If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
(such as zip code) or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), 
we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. 
The user should contact Customer Support for the applicable product or 
service. Send an email to: info@rfidjournal.com<br>
<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-Out <br>
</b>Our Web site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving 
future communications and unsolicited email from us. To opt-out, 
send an email to info@rfidjournal.com. <br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information 
and to store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us 
online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us 
securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just 
the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees 
who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing 
clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
Our Web site contains links to other sites. Neither RFID Journal Live!, 
RFID Journal University nor RFID Journal is responsible for the privacy practices 
or content of such external sites. We encourage our users to be aware when
they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to 
which we may link that may collect personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Notification And Changes<br>
</b>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page 
so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under 
which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy 
frequently to keep abreast of any changes.<br>
<br>
For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site 
or any dealings with RFID Journal Live!, RFID Journal University or RFID Journal, 
send e-mail to info@rfidjournal.com.<br>
