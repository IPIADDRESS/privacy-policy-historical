By using the Site or providing Personal Information to us following such changes, you will have accepted the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>	
<h3>Personal Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>"Personal Information"</strong> is information that identifies you as an individual.

</ul>

<h3>How Personal Information Is Disclosed</h3>
<p>Your Personal Information may be disclosed:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>To our third-party service providers, who provide services such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, order fulfillment, IT services and infrastructure, customer service, email delivery and administration, credit card processing, auditing and other similar services to enable them to provide services;</li>
	<li>To our subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, our "Affiliates") for marketing and other purposes;</li>
	<li>To selected third parties ("Promotional Partners"), to permit them to send to you marketing communications.  Restoration Hardware seeks to select as Promotional Partners only reputable companies that offer what we believe to be high-quality products and services;</li>
	<li>To third-party sponsors of contests, sweepstakes and similar promotions;</li>
	<li>To identify you to anyone to whom you send messages through the Site;</li>
	<li>By you, on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (please note that any information and materials that you post or disclose through such services will become public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public; we urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, on the Site);</li>
	<li>To a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding); and</li>
	<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our Affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, or that of you, our Affiliates or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h2>	
<h3>Non-Personal Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>"Non-Personal Information"</strong> is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Browser information</li>
	<li>Server log files</li>
	<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li>
	<li>Demographic information and other non-personally identifiable information provided by you and</li>
	<li>Aggregated information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How We Collect Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li><strong>Through your browser:</strong>  Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control ("MAC") address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, and the type and version of your operating system and browser.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Through server log files:</strong>  An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer by an Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Using cookies:</strong>  Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes.  We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.  If you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Site − such as the shopping cart, ability to view certain pages of the Site, and even placing orders or reviewing your order history − may not be available to you.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Flash Local Stored Objects:</strong>  We and our service providers may use a third-party technology, called Flash, in connection with the Site or our online content.  Flash provides a facility, referred to as Local Stored Objects ("LSO"), that allows a website operator or online content provider (or their service providers) to store certain information locally on an individual's computer; for example, Flash LSOs can be used to store information regarding an individual's computer.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the Website Storage Settings Panel.  You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Site or our online content.  We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:</strong>  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) are small images that may be used by us and our service providers in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, render the Site pages to you on various hardware devices and operating system versions, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.  Pixel tags may collect information such as the pages, features and links accessed by a Site visitor, and the IP address, browser type and operating system of such visitor's computer.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>From you:</strong>  We and our service providers may collect demographic information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, your gender and your date of birth, when you voluntarily provide this information to us or our service providers.  You may also have the opportunity to provide us with information regarding major events such as weddings, child births and the purchase of a new home.  We also maintain a record of your orders, purchases, exchanges, returns, wish lists and gift registries in connection with the Site or our businesses.  Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other customer or potential customer of our businesses.</li>
	<br>
	<li><strong>By aggregating information:</strong>  We and our service providers may aggregate Personal Information collected from our customers and potential customers, for example by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of such individuals who have a particular telephone area code.  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other customer or potential customer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information</h3>	
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your zip code).  If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information while it is so combined.</p>

<h2><strong>THIRD PARTIES AND THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></h2>
<p>To the extent that you submit any Personal Information to any third party (for example, via a third-party software application or service that is included in, available through or linked to from the Site), such third party's collection, use and disclosure of such information may be governed by its privacy policy, and not by our Privacy Policy.  We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USAGE, DISCLOSURE OR OTHER PRIVACY PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATING ANY SITE TO WHICH THIS SITE CONTAINS A LINK.  THE INCLUSION OF A LINK ON THE SITE DOES NOT IMPLY ENDORSEMENT OF THE LINKED SITE BY US OR BY OUR AFFILIATES.</p>

<h2><strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS</strong></h2>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site.  Please note that these companies may use information about your visit to the Site to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements to the Site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.</a></p>

<h2><strong>SECURITY</strong></h2>
<p>We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control.  For example, we seek to use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology for the placement of orders.  Unfortunately, no data storage system or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

In each case, please remember that, if you wish to opt-out of receiving all promotional emails from Restoration Hardware, you may need to opt-out separately for each Restoration Hardware brand.
