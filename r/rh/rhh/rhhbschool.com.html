You will know we have changed the Policy when you see a new effective date in the first sentence of this paragraph. The Company will not notify its Website visitors or customers of any such changes by e-mail or other personal contact. We encourage you to check the date of this Policy whenever you visit this Website so that you will know when you need to review the Policy for modifications. Please note that this Policy applies to all information collected online by the Company.</p>
<p>III. COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION<br>
	Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, postal delivery address, e-mail address, payment method (e.g., credit card or debit card) and telephone number, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information.<br>
	When you register or re-register at our Web site, we ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts. For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you. We use this personal information to process your registration, your subscriptions and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about Marie Forleo International, Inc. special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.</p>
<p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your site activity, payment history and correspondence. We use this information for such purposes as providing recommendations on RHH B-School that you may find useful, personalizing the site to better reflect particular interests, tracking your level of activity, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests and otherwise enhancing our service offerings for our customers. We also provide analyses of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. On an anonymous basis, we may also disclose and otherwise use, site habits, commentary, reviews and other non-personal information about our customers.</p>

<p>V. COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY<br>
	As you browse the Rich, Happy, and Hot B-School site, cookies may placed on your computer’s hard drive. (Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your hard drive for record keeping purposes.) In general, cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer. If your browser is set to not accept cookies, you may not be able to use particular services on the site.<br>
	In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including pixel tags, to gather information on how our users interact with our site and to otherwise help us efficiently operate and monitor our site and service. These technologies show us popular pages, conversion rates, click-throughs and other information that can be used to improve, operate and monitor our site and our service.</p>
<p>VI. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>
	Except as otherwise disclosed to you, we will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the personal information in advance and giving you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being shared.<br>
	We use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, process credit card transactions, collect debts, analyze and enhance data, including customers’ interaction with our site, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your personal information. These companies are not permitted to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them.</p>
<p>In addition, we may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for participation, will require personal information be shared with third parties. In such instances, you will be provided with notice of the sharing prior to your decision to participate.</p>
<p>Marie Forleo International, Inc. also reserves the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety. In the event that Marie Forleo International, Inc. is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right to sell or otherwise transfer the personal information we have collected as part of that transaction provided that such third party continues to honor our privacy policy.</p>
