We and our service providers may also collect a unique device identifier assigned by us&nbsp;or our service providers&nbsp;to the device from which you are accessing a Property and other transactional information for the device that we and our service providers may use to serve content and advertisements to the device.</li>
	<li><strong>Through your use of Mobile Apps:</strong> When you download and use a Mobile App, we and our service providers may track and collect Mobile App usage data, such as the date and time the Mobile App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Mobile App based on your device number.</li>
	<li><strong>Through server log files:</strong> An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing a Property by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Property, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Property.&nbsp; We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Property usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Properties and determining your approximate geographic location.</li>
	<li id="adchoices"><strong>Using cookies:</strong> We and our service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects (“<strong>Flash LSOs</strong>”)) and other similar technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information for our products and services, and for those of third parties, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Properties, and collect and store information about your use of the Properties.&nbsp; For example, pixel tags and web beacons may be used in connection with a Property to, among other things, track the actions of such Property's users, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about such Property's usage and response rates.
	<ul class="sub-ul-class"><li>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure on most devices through which the Properties are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies.&nbsp; To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.&nbsp; If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Properties may not be available to you.</li>
		<li>If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Properties, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>.&nbsp; You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).&nbsp; Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Properties or our content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.</li>

This collected information may let us know which services and features you are using the most within a Property, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>By aggregating information:</strong> We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Properties, for example, by using Personal&nbsp;Information to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How We May Use and Disclose Other&nbsp;Information</strong></p>

<p>Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in “How We May Collect Other Information” section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.&nbsp; In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location).&nbsp; If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br><br>
We will use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately in accordance with the “Contacting Us” section below.</p>

<p><strong>CHOICES AND ACCESS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal&nbsp;Information</strong></p>

<p>We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of Personal Information about you for marketing purposes.<br>
You may opt-out from the following as set forth below:</p>

<ul class="ul-class"><li><strong>Receiving marketing-related emails from us and our affiliates:</strong> If you do not want to receive marketing-related emails from us and our affiliates on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out from receiving such emails either by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided in the email or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Receiving marketing-related SMS text messages from us and our affiliates:</strong> If you&nbsp;do not want&nbsp;to receive marketing-related SMS text messages from us and our affiliates on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out from receiving such messages by texting back “STOP” or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Our sharing of your Personal Information with artists or unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes:</strong>If you prefer that we not&nbsp; share your Personal&nbsp;Information on a going-forward basis with artists or unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out from such sharing by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>In each case, please make clear in your email what you are opting-out from. We will comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that, if you do opt-out from receiving marketing-related messages from us, we may still send administrative messages to you.</p>

<p><strong>How you can access, change or delete your Personal&nbsp;Information</strong></p>

<p>If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete Personal Information that you previously provided to us, if you would like to object to our use of your Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>.&nbsp; We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.</p>

<p>In your request, please make clear what Personal&nbsp;Information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your Personal Information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

<p>Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).</p>

<p>Where our collection and use of Personal Information is based on your consent, you may withdraw such consent at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>, and such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before your withdrawal.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Border Transfer</strong></p>

<p>The Properties are controlled and operated from the United States; accordingly, this Privacy Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, is governed by the laws of the United States, and the Properties are not intended to subject Company or any of its affiliates to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Properties you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.</p>

<p><strong>If you are located in the EEA:</strong> Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission regarding Personal Information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a> or consult standard terms by following this <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">link</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Properties are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Properties.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we make the revised Privacy Policy available on or through a Property.</p>
