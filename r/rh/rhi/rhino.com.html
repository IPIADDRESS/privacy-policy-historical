<p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>
RHINO ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY (“<b>Company</b>”), a Warner Music Group company, is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our third-party service providers collect through certain of our owned or controlled websites, web properties (e.g., widgets and applications) and mobile applications (“<b>Mobile Apps</b>”) (collectively the “<b>Properties</b>”).  By providing Personal Information (as defined below) to us through the Properties, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third party, including Facebook, Inc., Apple Inc., Google Inc., Microsoft Corp., Research In Motion, any wireless carriers, our artists, our affiliates and any third party operating any site or property to which any Property contains a link.  In addition, the inclusion of a link on any Property does not imply endorsement of, or affiliation with, the linked site or Property by us or by our artists or affiliates.  Please note that the Properties may include the ability to access and submit (including, for example, via a third-party software application or service that is available through or in connection with a Property) certain information directly to third parties such as Facebook or to any application platform such as Apple's App Store or Google Play.  Such information is submitted by you directly to such third parties; this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information submitted by you to third parties.  
</p>

<p>
The Properties are controlled and operated from the United States; accordingly, this Privacy Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, is governed by U.S. law, and the Properties are not intended to subject Company or any of its affiliates to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.  If you are located in the European Union (EU), please note that we abide by the Safe Harbor framework agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the EU with respect to Personal Information collected by entities located in the European Economic Area and transferred to us in the United States.  Please review our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy located at <a href="http://www.wmg.com/privacy/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.wmg.com/privacy/safeharbor</a>.  More information about the Safe Harbor framework can be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.  
</p>

<p>
The Properties are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Properties.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your California Privacy Rights:</b>  If you are a California resident, you may request certain information once per year about our disclosure of certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding calendar year to third parties for such third parties' own direct marketing purposes.  Please send your request by email to <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@wmg.com">privacypolicy@wmg.com</a>, or by postal mail to Warner Music Group, Attn: Privacy Coordinator, 75 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10019.  We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the email or mailing addresses specified in this section.
</p>


<p>
<b>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b>
</p>

<p>
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time.  Please take a look at the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.

Your use of any Property or your submission of any information in connection with a Property following such changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

<li>To send to you SMS text messages, if you have indicated you would like to receive them.  Please keep in mind that message and data rates may apply.  You should check with your mobile service provider for applicable data rates.  At any time, you may text back “HELP” for further information regarding text messages.  If additional rules are provided in connection with any specific SMS text message sign-ups, such rules shall also apply and shall control in the event that they conflict with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>To personalize your experience on the Property by presenting content, products, and offers tailored to you.</li>

We may combine Personal Information that you submit on or through the Property with information that we collect from and about you from other online and offline sources, including from our own websites and web properties (including apps, widgets and players) and third party sources, which may include social media services you interact with through our Properties.

<ul>

<li>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure on most devices through which the Properties are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies.  To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/." target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/.</a>  If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Property that may not be available to you. </li> 


<li>If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Property, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained using the <a title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel.</a> You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the <a title="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Pane</a>l and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your device without you being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Property or our content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.</li>

<li>The use of these technologies allows our third-party vendors to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and the products and services of third parties, when you use the Property or other applications or visit websites or web properties across the Internet.
