                (660) 626-2014</strong></p>
              <p>C. We employ business associates who help us to administer our 
                services. Our business associates are also required to keep your 
                medical information confidential. Our business associates may 
                use and disclose your protected health information for treatment, 
                payment and health care operations without your consent or authorization. 
                In our efforts to keep you informed, several ways have been provided 
                to you as examples in which medical information may be used and 
                disclosed about you or a member of your family.</p>
              <p>D. We may use and disclose your Protected Health Information 
                (PHI) in the following ways: </p>
              <ol>
                <li> <strong>Treatment.</strong> The University may use your PHI 
                  to treat you. For Example, we may ask you to have laboratory 
                  tests (such as blood or urine tests), and we may use the results 
                  to help us reach a diagnosis. We might use your PHI in order 
                  to write a prescription for you, or we might disclose your PHI 
                  to a pharmacy when we order a prescription for you. Many of 
                  the people who work for our practice – including, but 
                  not limited to, our doctors and nurses – may use or disclose 
                  your PHI in order to treat you or to assist others in your treatment. 
                  Additionally, we may disclose your PHI to others who may assist 
                  in your care, such as your spouse, children or parents. Your 
                  medical information may be used to authorize referrals and for 
                  pre certification to obtain medical treatment services.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Payment.</strong> The University may use and disclose 
                  your PHI in order to bill and collect payment for the services 
                  and items you may receive from it. For example, the University 
                  may contact your health insurer to certify that you are eligible 
                  for benefits (and for what range of benefits), and we may provide 
                  your insurer with details regarding your treatment to determine 
                  if your insurer will cover, or pay for, your treatment. The 
                  University also may use and disclose your PHI to obtain payment 
                  from third parties that may be responsible for such costs, such 
                  as family members. Also, the University may use your PHI to 
                  bill you directly for services and items. This may include activities 
                  such as making a determination of eligibility or coverage for 
                  benefits, reviewing services provided to you for medical necessity, 
                  claims management, coordination of benefits, and undertaking 
                  utilization review activities.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Health Care Operations.</strong> The University may 
                  use and disclose your PHI to operate our business, for health 
                  plan administration, and/or for curriculum use. As examples 
                  of the ways in which we may use and disclose your information 
                  for our operations, the University may use your PHI to evaluate 
                  the quality of care you received from us, or to conduct cost-management 
                  and business planning activities for our clinical practice. 
                  Our business associates may combine medical information about 
                  many health plan members to decide what additional services 
                  the health plan should offer, whether certain new treatments 
                  are effective, and what services are not needed. Our business 
                  associates may provide the A.T. Still University of Health Sciences 
                  with de-identified information about care, treatment and services 
                  for plan members for use in student education.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Appointment Reminders.</strong> The University may 
                  use and disclose your PHI to contact you and remind you of an 
                  appointment.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Treatment Options.</strong> The University may use 
                  and disclose your PHI to inform you of potential treatment options 
                  or alternatives.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong> Health-Related Benefits and Services.</strong> The 
                  University may use and disclose your PHI to inform you of health-related 
                  benefits or services that may be of interest to you.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong> Release of Information to Family/Friends.</strong> 
                  The University may release your PHI to a friend, family member, 
                  a close friend or any other person you authorize, that directly 
                  relates to that person’s involvement in your healthcare. 
                  For example, a parent or guardian may ask that a baby-sitter 
                  take their child to the pediatrician’s office for treatment 
                  of a cold. In this example, the baby-sitter may have access 
                  to this child’s medical information.<br>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Disclosures Required by Law.</strong> The University 
                  will use and disclose your PHI when we are required to do so 
                  by federal, state or local law.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>D. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PHI IN CERTAIN SPECIAL 
                CIRCUMSTANCES</strong></p>
              <p>You have the opportunity to agree or object to the use or disclosure 
                of all or part of your protected health information. If you are 
                not present or able to agree or object to the use or disclosure 
                of the medical information, then the University may, using professional 
                judgment, determine whether the disclosure is in your best interest. 
                In this case, only the medical information that is directly relevant 
                to your health care will be disclosed. The following categories 
                describe unique scenarios in which we may use or disclose your 
                PHI without your consent, authorization, or opportunity to object:</p>
              <p>1.<strong> Public Health Risks</strong>. The University may disclose 
                your PHI to public health authorities, including but not limited 
                to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Department 
                of Health and Human Services (HHS), that are authorized by law 
                to collect information for the purpose of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Maintaining vital records, such as births and deaths</li>
                <li> Preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability</li>
                <li> Notifying a person regarding potential exposure to a communicable 
                  disease</li>
                <li> Notifying a person regarding a potential risk for spreading 
                  or contracting a disease or condition</li>
                <li> Reporting reactions to drugs or problems with products or 
                  devices</li>
                <li> Notifying individuals if a product or device they may be 
                  using has been recalled</li>
                <li> Notifying appropriate government agency (ies) and authority(ies) 
                  regarding the potential abuse or neglect of a patient (including 
                  domestic violence); however, we will only disclose this information 
                  if the patient agrees or we are required or authorized by law 
                  to disclose this information</li>
                <li> Notifying your employer under limited circumstances related 
                  primarily to workplace injury or illness or medical surveillance.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>2. <strong>Health Oversight Activities.</strong> The University 
                may disclose your PHI to a health oversight agency for activities 
                authorized by law. Oversight activities can include, for example, 
                investigations, inspections, audits, surveys, licensure and disciplinary 
                actions; civil, administrative, and criminal procedures or actions; 
                or other activities necessary for the government to monitor government 
                programs, compliance with civil rights laws and the health care 
                system in general.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Lawsuits and Similar Proceedings.</strong> The University 
                may use and disclose your PHI in response to a court or administrative 
                order, if you are involved in a lawsuit or similar proceeding. 
                We also may disclose your PHI in response to a discovery request, 
                subpoena, or other lawful process by another party involved in 
                the dispute, but only if we have made an effort to inform you 
                of the request or to obtain an order protecting the information 
                the party has requested.</p>
              <p>4. <strong>Law Enforcement.</strong> We may release PHI if asked 
                to do so by law enforcement officials:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Regarding a crime victim in certain situations, if we are 
                  unable to obtain the person’s agreement</li>
                <li> Concerning a death we believe has resulted from criminal 
                  conduct</li>
                <li> Regarding criminal conduct at our offices</li>
                <li> In response to a warrant, summons, court order, subpoena 
                  or similar legal process</li>
                <li> To identify/locate a suspect, material witness, fugitive 
                  or missing person</li>
                <li> In an emergency, to report a crime (including the location 
                  or victim(s) of the crime, or the description, identity or location 
                  of the perpetrator).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>5. <strong>Deceased Patients.</strong> The University may release 
                PHI to a medical examiner or coroner to identify a deceased individual 
                or to identify the cause of death. If necessary, the University 
                also may release information in order for funeral directors to 
                perform their jobs.</p>
              <p>6. <strong>Organ and Tissue Donation.</strong> The University 
                may release your PHI to organizations that handle organ, eye or 
                tissue procurement or transplantation, including organ donation 
                banks, as necessary to facilitate organ or tissue donation and 
                transplantation if you are an organ donor.</p>
              <p>7. <strong>Research</strong>. The University may use and disclose 
                your PHI for research purposes in certain limited circumstances. 
                The University will obtain your written authorization to use your 
                PHI for research purposes except when an Internal Review Board 
                or Privacy Board has determined that the waiver of your authorization 
                satisfies the following: (i) the use or disclosure involves no 
                more than a minimal risk to your privacy based on the following: 
                (A) an adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper 
                use and disclosure; (B) an adequate plan to destroy the identifiers 
                at the earliest opportunity consistent with the research (unless 
                there is a health or research justification for retaining the 
                identifiers or such retention is otherwise required by law); and 
                (C) adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be re-used 
                or disclosed to any other person or entity (except as required 
                by law) for authorized oversight of the research study, or for 
                other research for which the use or disclosure would otherwise 
                be permitted; (ii) the research could not practicably be conducted 
                without the waiver; and (iii) the research could not practicably 
                be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.</p>
              <p>8. <strong>Serious Threats to Health or Safety.</strong> The 
                University may use and disclose your PHI when necessary to reduce 
                or prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health 
                and safety of another individual or the public. Under these circumstances, 
                we will only make disclosures to a person or organization able 
                to help prevent the threat. </p>
              <p>9. <strong>Military.</strong> The University may disclose your 
                PHI if you are a member of U.S. or foreign military forces (including 
                veterans) and if required by the appropriate authorities.</p>
              <p>10. <strong>National Security.</strong> The University may disclose 
                your PHI to federal officials for intelligence and national security 
                activities authorized by law. We also may disclose your PHI to 
                federal officials in order to protect the President, other officials 
                or foreign heads of state, or to conduct investigations.</p>
              <p>11. <strong>Inmates.</strong> The University may disclose your 
                PHI to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials 
                if you are an inmate or under the custody of law enforcement officials. 
                Disclosure for these purposes would be necessary: (a) for the 
                institution to provide health care services to you, (b) for the 
                safety and security of the institution, and/or (c) to protect 
                your health and safety or health and safety of other individuals.</p>
              <p>12. <strong>Disaster Relief.</strong> Unless you object, your 
                medical information may be used or disclosed to an authorized 
                public or private entity to assist in disaster relief efforts 
                and coordinate use and disclosures to family or other individuals 
                involved in your health care. </p>
              <p>13. <strong>Worker’s Compensation.</strong> The University 
                may release your PHI for worker’s compensation and similar 
                programs.</p>
              <p><strong>E. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PHI</strong></p>
              <p>You have the following rights regarding the PHI that we maintain 
                about you and your dependents:</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Right to Confidential Communications.</strong> You 
                have the right to request that the University communicate with 
                you about your health and related issues in a particular manner 
                or at a certain location. For instance, you may ask that we contact 
                you at home, rather than work. Efforts will be made to accommodate 
                reasonable requests. In order to request a type of confidential 
                communication, you must make a written request to: Chief Privacy 
                Officer, A.T. Still University of Health Sciences, 800 West Jefferson 
                Street, Kirksville MO 63501, (660) 626-2014. Please specify the 
                requested method of contact, or the location where you wish to 
                be contacted. You do not need to give a reason for your request. 
              </p>
              <p>2. <strong>Right to Restrictions</strong>. You have the right 
                to request a restriction on the use or disclosure of your PHI 
                for treatment, payment, or health care operations. Additionally, 
                you have the right to request that the University restrict its 
                disclosure of your PHI to only certain individuals involved in 
                your care or the payment for your care, such as family members 
                and friends. <strong>The University is not required to agree to 
                your request</strong>; however, if the University does agree, 
                it is bound by the agreement except when otherwise required by 
                law, in emergencies, or when the information is necessary to treat 
                you. In order to request a restriction in the University’s 
                use or disclosure of your PHI, you must make your request in writing 
                to Chief Privacy Officer, 800 West Jefferson Street, Kirksville 
                MO 63501. The telephone number is (660) 626-2014. Your request 
                must describe in a clear and concise fashion:</p>
              <p>(a) the information you wish restricted.<br>
                (b) whether you are requesting to limit the University’s 
                use, disclosure or both; and <br>
                (c) to whom you want the limits to apply.</p>
              <p>If the University denies the request a written denial will be 
                given indicating the reason.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Right to Access.</strong> You have the right to inspect 
                and obtain a copy of the PHI that may be used to make decisions 
                about you, including patient medical records and billing records, 
                but not including psychotherapy notes. In order to inspect and/or 
                obtain a copy of your PHI, you must submit your request in writing 
                to: Chief Privacy Officer, A.T. Still University of Health Sciences, 
                800 West Jefferson Street, Kirksville, MO 63501. The telephone 
                number is (660) 626-2014. The University may charge a fee for 
                the costs of copying, mailing, labor, and supplies associated 
                with your request. The University may deny your request to inspect 
                and/or copy in certain limited circumstances; however, you may 
                request a review of our denial. Another licensed health care professional 
                chosen by us will conduct reviews. </p>
              <p>A.T. Still University of Health Sciences Health Plan does not 
                maintain a central file of your protected health information. 
                Health Network America, the Plan’s Administrator, maintains 
                a designated record set for the A.T. Still University of Health 
                Sciences Health Plan, as do our other business associates who 
                provide services for the health plan. </p>
              <p>4. <strong>Right to Amend. </strong>You may ask the University 
                to amend your PHI if you believe it is incorrect or incomplete, 
                and you may request an amendment for as long as the information 
                is kept by or for the University. To request an amendment, your 
                request must be made in writing and submitted to: Chief Privacy 
                Officer, A.T. Still University of Health Sciences, 800 West Jefferson 
                Street, Kirksville, MO 63501. The telephone number is (660) 626-2014. 
                You must provide us with a reason that supports your request for 
                amendment. The University will deny your request if you fail to 
                submit your request (and the reason supporting your request) in 
                writing. Also, we may deny your request if you ask us to amend 
                information that is in our opinion: (a) accurate and complete; 
                (b) not part of the PHI kept by or for the University; (c) not 
                part of the PHI which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; 
                or (d) not created by the University, unless the individual or 
                entity that created the information is not available to amend 
                the information.</p>
              <p>5. <strong>Accounting of Disclosures.</strong> All of our patients/plan 
                members have the right to request an “accounting of disclosures.” 
                An “accounting of disclosures” is a list of certain 
                non-routine disclosures the University has made of your PHI for 
                non-treatment or operations purposes. Disclosures related to treatment, 
                payment or health care operations will not be included in the 
                accounting. Examples of this are: the doctor sharing information 
                with the nurse; or the billing department using your information 
                to file your insurance claim. In order to obtain an accounting 
                of disclosures, you must submit your request in writing to: Chief 
                Privacy Officer, A.T. Still University of Health Sciences, 800 
                West Jefferson Street; Kirksville, MO 63501. The telephone number 
                is (660) 626-2014. All requests for an “accounting of disclosures” 
                must state a time period, which may not be longer than six (6) 
                years from the date of disclosure and may not include dates before 
                April 14, 2003. The first list you request within a 1-month period 
                is free of charge, but the University may charge you for additional 
                lists within the same 12-month period. The University will notify 
                you of the costs involved with additional requests, and you may 
                withdraw your request before you incur any costs.</p>

                Disclosures.</strong> The University will obtain your written 
                authorization for uses and disclosures that are not identified 
                by this notice or permitted by applicable law. Any authorization 
                you provide to us regarding the use and disclosure of your PHI 
                may be revoked at any time <strong><u>in writing</u></strong>. 
                After you revoke your authorization, we will no longer use or 
                disclose your PHI for the reasons described in the authorization. 
                Please note: we are required to retain records of your care.</p>
