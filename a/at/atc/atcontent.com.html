We collect such information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website.  We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>

        <p>As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information as described above in the Browsing section of this Privacy Policy (above).  In connection with subscribing to the services available on the Website or other activities, such as utilizing online software applications or purchasing or downloading any of the products and services available on the Website, AtContent may ask you to voluntarily supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.  It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities and/or make any purchases.  If you elect to engage in these activities or make purchases or use Widgets, however, AtContent may ask that you provide us personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), email address, employer, and other personal information.  This information is requested in conjunction with the purchase and registration of our Products or Services.  In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to product or services updates</p>

        <p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time.  However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.  AtContent will inform you of the mandatory and/or optional character of the requested and/or required information. </p>

        <p>AtContent is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website, including without limitation, any analytical data gathered in connections with your use of AtContent’s Wisgets. AtContent will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on the Website and the subsequent legislation adopted in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>When you use the Website, AtContent or third parties authorized by AtContent may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its services.  When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to AtContent every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website.  Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the “Refer”), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site.  All of this information may be collected by AtContent and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>

        <p>We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services.  AtContent also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website.  Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.</p>

        <p>You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter and product or services updates.  This newsletter is a marketing tool that allows AtContent to inform you of new Products and Services, as well as other news relevant to the company.  The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address.  Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent.  You are given the opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.</p>

        <p>When you submit personal information to AtContent through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which AtContent and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices.  You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of AtContent.  Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p>

        <p>AtContent may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website, such as PayPal ™ .  Typically, these providers would offer services that AtContent customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with AtContent services and products (i.e. Widgets).  In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers.  Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider’'s Website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. For instance, the credit card information entered as part of the filling out the purchase form or registration process is collected by the third parties registration and/or merchant services and subject to their respective privacy policies.  You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with AtContent personal information collected from you.  In such instances, AtContent may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy</p>

        <h3>Personal Account</h3>

        <p>At your choice, you may create a personal account containing your personal information. A personal account is required for description of services which require a personal account on the Website.  When you create a personal account, some information about your account activity will be provided to other users of AtContent.  For instance, other users may be able to view which content you have accessed via the Website.  You can access, review and update your personal account information online via the Website.</p>


        <p>If you wish to deactivate your personal account, contact AtContent at privacy@atcontent.com..  When you deactivate your personal account, all information stored and maintained as part of your account will be deleted from our servers, provided that the information may be retained by AtContent for archival, backup and record purposes.  You have the right to access and change your personal information and privacy preferences at any time by logging into your personal account, where you can view and make changes to your personal information.  You may also access and change your personal information and privacy preferences by contacting us at privacy@atcontent.com.</p>
        <h3>Updating Your Personal Preferences</h3>

        <p>As a registered user you have the right to access and change your personal information and privacy preferences at any time by logging into your personal account, where you can view and make changes to your personal information.  You may also access and change your personal information and privacy preferences by contacting AtContent at: privacy@atcontent.com.</p>

        <h3>Information Relating to Children</h3>

        <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/. The Website and any products or services available on the Website are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply.  However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter or purchase products and services.  The collection of this information is covered above.  Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child.  You may do so by contacting us by letter (using the address information provided at the bottom of this page) or email to privacy@atcontent.com.</p>

        <h3>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</h3>

        <p>AtContent operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.  Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.  AtContent takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.</p>

        <p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches AtContent it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of AtContent. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.  Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where AtContent and its service providers conduct business.  All AtContent employees are aware of our privacy and security policies.  Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p>

        <h2>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

        <h3>How Your Personal Information Is Used</h3>

        <p>AtContent collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.  We will use your email address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected.  If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.  Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of AtContent and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.</p>

        <p>AtContent may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.  This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. AtContent may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>

        <p>AtContent recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website.  Without your consent, AtContent will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from AtContent or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website.  Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, AtContent will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>

        <p>AtContent does use the services of third parties, such as email service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtContent.  You may also use your third party login accounts and passwords (e.g. Facebook; Twitter) in order to register and login to the Website and use AtContent’s services. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose AtContent specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the AtContent’s affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>

        <p>AtContent may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.  AtContent may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the CompanyAtContent or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.</p>

        <p>In the event that all or substantially all of AtContent’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AtContent may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity.  If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes. </p>

        <h3>Choices Available to You </h3>

        <p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such services.  </p>

        <p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtContent or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to “opt out” we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.  However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements. </p>

        <p>AtContent is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. </p>

        <p>When you create a personal account with AtContent and/or provide your email address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via email and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  These communications will relate to AtContent offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom AtContent has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you.  Also note that unless otherwise communicated by you to CPlas, your User Content may be shared by another user with third parties.</p>

        <p>We may use a third party email service provider to send emails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send AtContent related email.  If you do not wish to receive emails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: unsubscribe@atcontent.com.  In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.  You may also opt-out online by updating your personal account as described in the Updating Your Personal References section of this Privacy Policy (above).</p>

        <p>If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you may contact AtContent by email at privacy@atcontent.com.</p>

        <p>To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide AtContent with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records.  The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to AtContent when you requested services or products.   AtContent reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>

        <p>Our Website uses “cookie” technology.  “Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer.

        <p>In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our emails, use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement.
