    <h2>Atom Tickets Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Atom Tickets! Atom Tickets, LLC (“<b>Atom Tickets</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>”) has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe its practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at <a href="http://www.atomtickets.com">www.atomtickets.com</a> (the “<b>Website</b>”) and online services (“<b>Services</b>”), including our mobile application (“<b>App</b>”).</p>

    <p>If you have any questions or concerns or complaints about our Privacy Policy or our information collection or processing practices, or if you want to report any security violations to us, please contact us at <a href="privacy@atomtickets.com">privacy@atomtickets.com</a>. So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “<b>Personal Information</b>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. When we use the phrase “<b>Anonymous Information</b>” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Children.</b>
      <br>
      Our Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Services are designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Information We Collect.</b><br>
      <u>Personal Information</u><br>
      In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Services.  We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration and in the course of your use of the Website and/or Services (though some of this information may go directly to our payment provider). To use certain features of the Services, we require you to create an <b>“Account”</b> by providing your name, phone number, and a password. When you purchase Tickets or Concessions on the Services, we will collect all information necessary to process the transaction (though some of this information may go directly to our payment provider).
    </p>

    <p>
    To the extent you post Personal Information in comments in a publicly available area of our Services (e.g., ratings and reviews), it will be available to other users of the Services who may use it at their discretion.  Please be thoughtful about the information that you post in any forums or comments.
    </p>

    <p>
    When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we will collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. Any information you choose to provide for our use should reflect how much you want other Users to know about you. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services you are able to use.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, our App may collect information about your contacts from your contact book and images from your image gallery, and we use that information to provide you certain functionality as part of the App and Services. As this is associated with you, we consider it to be Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>
    As you use the App, we may collect location-based information from you through your mobile or other location-aware device. Certain of our Services are location-specific and can provide helpful information based on where you are. If you tell us where you are (i.e., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may use that information to provide you with location-based information. If you want to deactivate this feature, you can disable location services on your mobile device, but we will not be able to provide those Services. Please contact your carrier for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
    <u>Information Collected from You About Others.</u><br>
    If you purchase Tickets for others or share your plans with them,, you provide and we collect the name, phone numbers, and email addresses of those people. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses as required above.  You or the third party may contact us at <a href="privacy@atomtickets.com">privacy@atomtickets.com</a> to request the removal of this information from our database
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Disclosure – Our Relationship with Social Networking Services</i><br>
    We may create interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking services such as Facebook (each, an <b>“SNS”</b>) through our Services. We work with the SNS’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that SNS on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorization, you do not provide us with your user name or password to the SNS, but you will need to log-in to that SNS directly through our Services.  Once authorized by you, the SNS provides us a token that allows the SNS to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. For example, when you click “Connect” to grant us access to your Facebook account, we will import your name and other information from Facebook and as you use or Services, we may periodically check for updates to such information. You can revoke our access to any SNS at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.
    </p>

    <p>
    <u>Anonymous Information</u><br>
    We collect the following types of Anonymous Information:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Information Collected by Our Servers</i>.  To make our Website and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (<b>“IP”</b>) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Log Files</i>.  As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (<b>“ISP”</b>), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Cookies</i>.  Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “<b>Cookies</b>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.  This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service. If you have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided below.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Mobile Device</i>. We may collect information about the computer or device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information. In addition, the Services may access your device's image storage applications, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the Services. For more information about how you can control our access to these applications, please see "Your Choices" below.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Pixel Tags</i>. In addition, we may use “<b>Pixel Tags</b>” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).  Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of online users.  In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.  Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.  We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Information.
      </li>

      <li>
        <i>Collection of Information by Advertisers</i>.  We may use third parties to serve ads on the Services.  Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Services (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).  They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <u>Disclosure – Analytics.</u><br>
    We may also use third party tracking services to help us analyze how users use the App and Services.  These services collect only the unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device, rather than your name or other personally identifying information, and use it to collect information such as how often users open the App and what features they use in the App. We only use this information to improve our App and Services. We do not combine the information generated thereby with your Personal Information and we do not associate you in any way with your device identifier. Only these services know and associate you (on a non-identifiable basis) with your identifier.
    </p>

    <p>
    We use a number of third party service providers to help analyze how users use our Services (“Analytics Companies”).  These Analytics Companies use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Services and what they do within our Services. We do not combine the information gathered through the use of Analytics Companies with your Personal Information.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>How We Use Information.</b><br>

We may share some or all of your Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets.

If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><u>Social Networking Sites</u>.  Some of our Services may enable you to post content to social networks (SNSs) (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNSs.  We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs.</li>

      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
    <b>Anonymous Information</b><br>
    We use the Anonymous Information we collect to analyze trends, administer and improve the Services, track users’ movements in the App, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the Log Files may be collected so that when you use the App again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to make available information appropriate to your interests. We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION.</b>
      </p><ul>
          <li><u>Email Communications</u>. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our App or Services.  When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy, which you may not opt out of.</li>
          <li><u>Cookies</u>.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service. If you have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided below.</li>
          <li><u>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information</u>. You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in your Account by contacting us. If you completely delete all of your Personal Information, then your account may become deactivated, although we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us. We may also retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures. In addition, publicly available information will not be deleted from our Services. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Services. Upon your request, we will close your Account. We may retain your Personal Information to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
