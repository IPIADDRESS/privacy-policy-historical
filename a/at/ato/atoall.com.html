        <h3 id="information">Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
        We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for 
        an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Atoall 
        Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect 
        the following types of information: </div>
        <div class="share1"><h4>Information you provide</h4> – When you 
          sign up for a Atoall Account or other Atoall service or promotion that 
          requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as 
          your name, email address and an account password). For certain 
          services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit 
          card or other payment account information which we maintain in 
          encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you 
          submit under your account with information from other Atoall services 
          or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and 
          to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may 
          give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.
          </div><div class="share1"><h4>Cookies</h4> – When you visit Atoall, 
          we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of 
          characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies 
          your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, 
          including for storing user preferences, improving search results and 
          ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. 
          Atoall also uses cookies in its advertising services to help 
          advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may 
          set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, 
          including Atoall sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or 
          click on an ad supported by Atoall’s advertising services. </div><div class="share1"><h4>Log information</h4> – When you access 
          Atoall services, our servers automatically record information that 
          your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may 
          include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
          address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your 
          request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your 
          browser. </div><div class="share1"><h4>User communications</h4> – When you 
          send email or other communications to Atoall, we may retain those 
          communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your 
          requests and improve our services. </div><div class="share1"><h4>Affiliated Atoall Services on other sites</h4> 
          – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. 
          Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to 
          Atoall in order to deliver the service. We process such information 
          under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our 
          services are offered may have different privacy practices and we 
          encourage you to read their privacy policies. </div><div class="share1"><h4>Gadgets</h4> – Atoall may make 
          available third party applications through its services. The 
          information collected by Atoall when you enable a gadget or other 
          application is processed under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;Information 
          collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their 
          privacy policies. </div><div class="share1"><h4>Location data</h4> – Atoall offers 
          location-enabled services, such as Atoall Maps for mobile. If you use 
          those services, Atoall may receive information about your actual 
          location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information 
          that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). </div><div class="share1"><h4>Links</h4> – Atoall may present links 
          in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have 
          been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our 
          search technology, customized content and advertising.&nbsp; </div><div class="share1"><h4>Other sites</h4> – This Privacy Policy 
          applies to Atoall services only. We do not exercise control over the 
          sites displayed as search results, sites that include Atoall 
          applications, products or services, or links from within our various 
          services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files 
          on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from 
          you. </div><div class="share1">Atoall only processes personal information for the 
        purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary 
        privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such

        <h3 id="infochoices">Choices for personal information</h3>
        </div><div class="share1">When you sign up for a particular service that 
        requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we 
        use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it 
        was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. 
        </div><div class="share1">If we propose to use personal information for any 
        purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the 
        specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to 
        opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We 
        will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than 
        those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary 
        service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. 
        </div><div class="share1">Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can 
        reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is 
        being sent. However, some Atoall features and services may not function

        </div><div class="share1">If Atoall becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, 
        or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the 
        confidentiality of any personal information involved in such 
        transactions and provide notice before personal information is 
        transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
        </div><div class="share1">We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, 
        non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a

        advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.

        against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or 
        destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data 
        collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as 
        well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access 
        to systems where we store personal data.

        bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, 
        including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet 
        these obligations.

        purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy 
        Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our 
        data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only 
        collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or 
        improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We 
        take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process 
        is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update 
        or correct their personal information whenever necessary. 
        <h3 id="access">Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
        </div><div class="share1">When you use Atoall services, we make good faith 
        efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and 
        either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data 
        at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or 
        for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify 
        themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or 
        removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process 
        requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require 
        disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or 
        would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning

        correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so
