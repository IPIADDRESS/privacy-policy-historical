<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail 
  service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies 
  that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtomPark Software Inc. These 
  parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information 
  for any purpose other than for the purpose AtomPark Software Inc. specifies. 
  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers 
  for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual 
  obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information 
  to entities outside of the AtomPark Software Inc.'s affiliates for their use 
  without your approval.</p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. may disclose your personally identifiable information 
  if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply 
  with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AtomPark Software Inc. 
  may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to 
  believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or

  End User License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public 
  or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist 
  us in developing, operating and maintaining AtomPark Software Inc.'s products.</p>
<p>In the event that all or substantially all of AtomPark Software Inc.'s stock

  we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the 
  collection of this information.<br>
  You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtomPark Software

  issuance of these types of communications are rare. </p>
