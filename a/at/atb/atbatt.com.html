<br><br>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
<br><br>

Log Files are not tied to personally identifiable information. 
<br><br>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information.</b> When you make a purchase from our site you can choose to open an account, which will allow you to store your billing and shipping information on our servers or you can check out without opening an account.

<br><br>
<b>Security.</b> Our secure servers protect sensitive data including your credit card information using SSL encryption and firewall technology to protect your personal information from being read as it travels to our ordering system. Information sent to us by email is not encrypted and is therefore not secure. While we take reasonable measures to prevent the loss or misuse of the information that you provide to us, including but not limited to, your Personally Identifiable Information, due to factors beyond our control, we do not guarantee that your Personally Identifiable Information or any other information collected by us will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or other third parties or from other criminal activities.
