                including Ours. We encourage parents to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software 
                manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information

            <h3>Cookies, Web Beacons and Targeted Advertising </h3>
            <p>
                Like many websites, We use "cookies," which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. These cookies help Us identify Our account holders and allow us to 
                better optimize their shopping experience. Cookies do not include any data that will identify you personally. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but allow you to disable 
                them if you wish.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Most browsers provide you with the option to set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you opt not 
                to receive any cookies, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features on Our Website.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We may use third-party advertising companies to provide Us with data collection and reporting services regarding Our guests' activities on Our Website, tracking and measuring 
                performance of Our marketing efforts and your response to Our marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These companies may employ cookies and action 
                tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Website. 
                Web beacons enable Us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits Our Website and to learn which banner ads bring users to Our Website. In addition, We and Our third 
                party service providers may use cookies to manage and track the performance of Our advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or 
                the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which of Our advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than this Website. 
                The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number), and it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, 
                such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from Us or through third party website publishers.  
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information transmitted to Us using this Website. 
                To help guard your information, our Website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only We are able to decode your 
                information. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.
