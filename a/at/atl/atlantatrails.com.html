Atlanta Trails takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it. See this privacy policy primer to learn more about privacy policies in general.<br><br>

All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes.
<br><br>
Where necessary, Atlanta Trails uses cookies to store information about a visitor's preferences and history in order to better serve the visitor and/or present the visitor with customized content.
<br><br>
Advertising partners and other third parties may also use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitors to our site in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies.

<br><br><p>We use “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> (as <a title="amendments for government websites of the Google Analytics Terms of Use" href="http://www.howto.gov/sites/default/files/google-analytics-tos-amendment.pdf">amended for government websites</a>) and the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml">disabling cookies</a> on your browser.</p>
<p>Google Analytics employs cookies to define user sessions, which allows for the collection of data about how visitors are using the websites. Google Analytics uses only first-party cookies for data analysis.  This means that the cookies are linked to a specific website domain, and Google Analytics will only use that cookie data for statistical analysis related to your browsing behavior on that specific website.  According to Google, the data collected cannot be altered or retrieved by services from other domains.</p>
<p>If you choose, you can opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your web browser. For more information on Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a></p>
