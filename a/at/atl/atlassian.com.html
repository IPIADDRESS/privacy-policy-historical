    Atlassian adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable
    information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, and/or other identifiable information).
</p>

<h2>Gathering and Use of Information</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        We will never share your information with third parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission
        for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
    </li>
    <li>
        In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable
        information. This could be in connection with the following:
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>software evaluation registration</li>
        <li>subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)</li>
        <li>purchase transactions</li>
        <li>content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or
            voting
        </li>
        <li>contest or sweepstakes registration</li>
        <li>bug submission</li>
        <li>feature request</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
        software, which encrypts information you input.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you chose to have a relationship with Atlassian, such as a contractual or other business relationship
        or partnership, we will naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business relationship.
    </li>
    <li>
        Employees of Atlassian or approved contractors or resellers have access to personally identifiable
        customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy
        and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your information with third
        parties outside Atlassian unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required
        to do so under applicable law.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you call us to find out whether another person or party within your organisation has evaluated or purchased
        our software, we may disclose that information, but you will be required to demonstrate proof that you belong
        to the organisation that you are inquiring about. Atlassian will not willfully disclose your personal
        information
        to any third party without first receiving your permission.
    </li>
    <li>
        As an international company, Atlassian maintains databases in Australia and the United States. Any information
        that you submit to us via our Websites may be sent electronically to a database maintained in either country.
        We protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all Atlassian networks adhere to
        data-protection principles described in this page.
    </li>
    <li>
        We store all email transactions and strive to keep records of phone calls with customers, partners, and
        software evaluators so we have a history of our interactions that can be used for Pre-Sales Support and
        Technical Support.
    </li>
    <li>
        We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location,
        position, tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address
        (although generally they do not), we will use that data to send you further information only if the
        form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such
        permission at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Atlassian family of websites contain links to other sites. Atlassian is not responsible for
        the privacy practices or the content of these linked websites.

    <li>
        You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from Atlassian at any time. You only need to <a href="/about/contact.jsp">e-mail
        us</a> to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Although opt-out
        requests are usually processed immediately, please allow five (5) business days for
        the removal to be processed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transactions are recorded, including, but not limited to, when a user downloads software, purchases, logs

<h2 id="trademark">Trademarks</h2>

<p>After 7 years in business, Atlassian is evolving its official brand guidelines and sharing these guidelines publicly
    with partners or other Atlassian ambassadors. Why now? </p>

<ul>
    <li>We want our brand and brand names to be associated with awesome dev and IT tools. The more focused the use of
        the brand, the more powerful it will be in the community.
    </li>
    <li>More people and companies are building plugins and becoming partners or ambassadors of Atlassian and our
        products. They are asking for additional guidelines around how to market, design and brand their plugins and
        products so they (1) complement the Atlassian product "family", and (2) are distinct from from Atlassian
        products and brands while remaining part the Atlassian community.
    </li>
    <li>We want to avoid potential conflicts that may arise. If your brand is not clearly differentiated, customers may
        struggle to identify who to work with or what to buy. As a way of protecting our brands, as well as the best
        interests of our 3rd party developers and customers, we are sharing publishing these expanded guidelines.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Our Trademarks</h3>

<p>
    Atlassian has registered some of the trademarks below or has otherwise sought protection as indicated below in
    Australia, the U.S and other countries. We have done this to protect and preserve the marks for our community of
    customers, developers, partners, and supporters for the benefit of everyone involved with Atlassian. By this we mean
    that people should be able to recognize when a product is from Atlassian.

<p>
    If you have any questions about the use of Atlassian trademarks, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:trademarks@atlassian.com">trademarks@atlassian.com</a>.
</p>

<h3>Our logos</h3>

<p>Atlassian logos are distinctive graphic renditions. You may use the <a href="/about/press/logos.jsp">Atlassian logo or
    product logos</a> in a blog or news article, publication, book or other online or offline medium, or on your website
    in reference to the respective Atlassian product, without our written consent, provided that the logos are
    duplicated
    exactly as shown in the preceding link, and the Â® symbol (or the <sup class="trademark">TM</sup> symbol, as
    applicable) attached to the shoulder of the logo as in the attached link is retained. All other usages of the
    Atlassian logos require the written approval of Atlassian.</p>

<h3>Name dropping</h3>

<p>Trademarks protect Atlassian as well as our community of customers, developers, partners, and vendors. They identify
    the source of one provider's products from another. By "products" we mean all types of offerings, ranging from
    commercial products and services to open source and free software and informational websites. Trademark law protects
    the public's ability to rely on trademarks for information about product source and quality, requiring trademark
    owners to take steps to police proper use of their marks.</p>

<p>In the Atlassian ecosystem of customers, vendors and partners, the Atlassian product names are used in naming for 3rd
    party products, product reviews, product usage, and more. Below are some guidelines for using Atlassian product
    naming conventions in your work:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It's okay to use Atlassian's product names and trademarks in your own software product or company naming,
        however it must be clear that your product is a third-party tool, not an Atlassian-generated tool. <p style="margin:.5em 0 1em"><em>For example:</em>
        "Acme plugin for JIRAÂ®" <em>is okay, whereas</em> "JIRAÂ® plugin for Acme" <em>is not. The former connotes a 3rd
        party plugin for JIRAÂ®, the latter connotes an Atlassian-developed tool</em>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>It's okay to use Atlassian logos and brand names on your website or blog. You don't need permission from us to
        use the brands or names.
    </li>
    <li>Your website should look like your website, not ours. It should not borrow heavily from or closely resemble
        Atlassian's website or web properties. For the sake of customers and consumers, clearly distinguishable websites
        help everyone.
    </li>
    <li>You may use the Atlassian logo or product logo in any blog, news article, or on your website without our written
        consent, as long as you follow these guidelines and do not modify our brand designs.
    </li>
    <li>It is acceptable to use Atlassian or our product names or brands in publications, blogs, books or other online
        or offline mediums, provided this outline is adhered to and the Â® symbol or <sup class="trademark">TM</sup>
        symbol as applicable is retained on the right shoulder of the mark. In a longer publication where Atlassian is
        cited more than once, the trademark symbol need only be used the first time the brand is mentioned.
    </li>
    <li>Do not concatenate product names, e.g., "MyConnectorJIRA."</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to modify the Atlassian logo or product logos in anyway except to resize a logo for the

<h3>Atlassian Style</h3>

<p>In addition to trademarks and service marks, Atlassian has developed artwork, screenshots, and imagery for our
    website and other web properties.</p>

<p>Atlassian's "look" or "feel" should not be reproduced or mimicked for the same reasons cited above: consumers and
    customers can be confused about whether they're dealing with Atlassian or another company. The Atlassian website and
    all intellectual property rights, including all Copyright rights therein, are owned by Atlassian. Reproduction or
    "creative borrowing" of the website or artwork without permission is a violation of Atlassian's Copyright. Atlassian

<h3>Grandfathering</h3>

<p>We realize these guidelines are being introduced at a point in time when some companies and individuals already have
    product names that include the Atlassian trademarks. Companies and individuals using the Atlassian product
    trademarks by or before October 1, 2009 will not be required to change their already existing product names to
    comply with these guidelines now or in the future. However, we do request that these companies and individuals give
    proper notice and attribution of the Atlassian trademarks, and that any new product name will follow these
    guidelines.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the use of Atlassian marks or logos, please contact us at <a href="mailto:trademarks@atlassian.com">trademarks@atlassian.com</a>.</p>
