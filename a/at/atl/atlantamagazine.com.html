				<p>
					Privacy Policy 
				</p>
				<p>
					This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes
					Atlanta Magazine privacy practices for our Web site
					located at www.atlantamagazine.com (our "Site"),
					including what types of information we gather and
					track, how we use the information, and with whom we
					share the information.  By using the Site, you agree
					to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and
					by the Terms of Use. We may change this Privacy
					Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Site,
					and your continued use of the Site indicates your
					agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, we urge
					you to frequently review this Privacy Policy, and,
					if you do not agree to the terms of this or any
					revised policy, please exit the Site immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
					Privacy of Children 
				</p>
				<p>
					Children (persons under the age of 13 are not
					eligible to use the Site without the supervision of
					their parents.  If you are under the age of 13
					please do not submit any personal information to us
					or use any function of the Site, including the
					Forums, that require the disclosure of personal
					information.  If you are under the age of 13 please
					only use this Site under the supervision of your
					parents or guardian.  If you are under 13, please do
					not provide us with any information about yourself. 
					If we discover that we have collected any Personally
					Identifiable Information regarding a child 12 or
					under we will delete the information as soon as
					possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					What Information is Collected
				</p>
				<p>
					Atlanta Magazine may collect two types of
					information about you: Personally Identifiable
					Information and Aggregate Information that is
					anonymous (such as your IP address - a number used
					to identify your computer when you are on the
					Internet - or the type of browser you are using).
				</p>
				<p>
					Personally Identifiable Information: "Personally
					Identifiable Information" refers to information that
					lets us know the specifics of who you are and can be
					used to identify, contact or locate you (such as your
					name, address, telephone number and e-mail address). 
					You can visit our Site without telling us who you are
					and without revealing any information about yourself. 
					You may be required to register or otherwise voluntarily
					provide Personally Identifiable Information to have
					access to some features of the Site. You always may
					choose not to provide the Personally Identifiable
					Information, but this may lead to decreased
					functionality of the Site for you and our inability to
					provide you with certain products or services. We also
					may request you to voluntarily provide Personally
					Identifiable Information that is not required to access
					features of our site. This information enables Atlanta
					Magazine to make general improvements to the Site and
					better serve your specific interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aggregate Information: Atlanta Magazine may
					transparently collect Aggregate Information through the
					use of cookies or by other means. We use this
					information to assess general usage patterns, administer
					and make improvements to the Site and collect
					demographic information useful in some way to Atlanta
					Magazine and our business partners. We hope that by
					using Aggregate Information, we can update the Site to
					make it more useful to you and other users. We, and our
					business partners, reserve the right to use, maintain,
					update, disclose and/or sell Aggregate Information.
				</p>
				<p>				
					What We Will and Will Not Do With the Information You Provide
				</p>
				<p>
					Atlanta Magazine uses information generally to compile
					statistical data, keep in contact with users and provide
					them with a better interactive experience.
				</p>
				<p>									
					We may use your information specifically for the
					following purposes: to provide easy access every time
					you return to the Site without requiring re-entry of
					registration information; to keep you informed about
					products and services in which you may have interest; to
					complete business transactions; to contact you as part
					of a promotion; to allow you to make a posting on the
					Site; to administer individual accounts; to provide
					customer support; to meet legal requirements; to provide
					Internet security; and/or to analyze the collected
					information.  In the event of a merger, consolidation,
					or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our
					assets or business, one of the assets transferred may
					include the information we collect about our users.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also reserve the right to collect Personally
					Identifiable Information about you when you sign up for
					our Forums.  We will collect this information to ensure
					compliance with our Forum rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					Atlanta Magazine works closely with our business
					partners and certain other third parties who may perform
					functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders,
					providing promotional materials to our users, sending
					e-mail, managing data, processing credit card payments
					or providing customer service. They have access to your
					Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent
					necessary to perform their functions and may not use it
					for any other purpose. Further, these business partners
					and other third parties may from time to time wish to
					extend special offers to you on their own behalf. We may
					use your Personally Identifiable Information to assist
					our business partners in offering you these products,
					services and information and may act as an intermediary
					(for instance, sending you e-mail on their behalf).
				</p>
				<p>
					We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as
					other efforts to enforce laws.  We may also disclose
					Personally Identifiable Information in response to legal
					process, such as a court order or subpoena, or to
					protect the Site, hosted sites or users of these sites. 
					We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information
					in response to a request by law enforcement if there is
					an investigation of criminal conduct or other illegal
					activity.  In most cases you may not receive notice of
					this disclosure to law enforcement.  Therefore, we
					cannot promise, nor should you expect that,
					communications you make will always remain private.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this
					Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personally
					Identifiable Information to any third parties unless we
					obtain your prior consent or are legally compelled to do
					so. In addition, we will not contact you without your
					permission except as specified above or in connection
					with the registration process. On the Site, you will be
					given the opportunity to opt out of receiving e-mails or
					other information from [insert name of station]. If you
					have questions about how your personally identifiable
					information is used, please contact us.
				</p>
				<p>									
					Third Party Advertising 
				</p>
				<p>
					We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads
					when you visit the Site. These companies may use
					information (not including your name, address, email
					address or telephone number) about your visits to this
					and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements
					on this Site and other sites about goods and services
					that may be of interest to you. If you would like more
					information about this practice and to know your choices
					about not having this information used by these
					companies, click here.
				</p>
				<p>									
					Cookies
				</p>
				<p>
					When you visit the Site, we or a third-party advertiser
					may store or recognize some information on your computer
					in the form of a "cookie" or similar file that can help
					us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor
					the Site to better match your interests and preferences.
					With most Internet browsers or other software, you can
					erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all
					cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
					Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen
					to learn more about these functions. If you reject
					cookies, functionality of the Site may be severely
					limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of
					many of the Site's best features.
				</p>
				<p>									
					About Our Forums 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Site features forums (such as message boards and
					chat rooms), which enable our users to communicate with
					each other. We do not moderate and are not responsible
					for the content which you or any user posts on any forum
					on the Site. All Personally Identifiable Information you
					post in a forum may be viewed, collected and used by any
					visitor to the Site and is beyond our control.
					Therefore, Atlanta Magazine strongly recommends that you
					do not post on any forum private information about
					yourself or other individuals.
				</p>
				<p>									
					Linking to Our Business Affiliates' and Third Party Web Sites 
				</p>
				<p>
					The Site contains links to sites operated by our
					business partners and other third parties. Once you
					leave the Site, you may or may not see a new URL in the
					location bar. Please review the linked site's privacy
					policies, and if you do not agree to be bound by the
					terms of the policies governing that site, terminate
					your visit to that site. We are not responsible for the
					privacy policies and practices of the sites operated by
					our business partners or other third parties.
				</p>
				<p>									
					How Secure is Your Information 
				</p>
				<p>
					Any unauthorized use of the Site may result in criminal
					and/or civil prosecution. We have reasonable policies
					and procedures in place to protect the privacy and
					confidentiality of your information that we collect and
					maintain. All Personally Identifiable Information is
					stored on our secured servers, behind a firewall at a
					data center with access to data strictly controlled. To
					help ensure the privacy of your information, we urge you
					not to share your user name and password with anyone and
					recommend that you change your password frequently and
					store it in a safe place. If you are asked to create a
					user name or password, please select words that do not
					personally identify you.
				</p>
				<p>									
					The Site offers "auto login" which allows users to enter
					member areas of the Site without re-entering password
					information. You may want to disable auto login on your
					"Set Up" page if you are not the only person using your
					computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					You should note that while we take steps to protect your
					privacy and security there is no "perfect security" on
					the Internet and by disclosing information there is a
					chance that the information may be intercepted or become
					public.
				</p>
				<p>									
					How Information Can Be Accessed or Modified 
				</p>

					Web site or wish to access or modify your Personally
					Identifiable Information collected at the Site:
