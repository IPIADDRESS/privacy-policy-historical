<div class="definition"> <h2>Scope of Privacy Policy</h2> <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of "Atlassian Services" via a "Device" or when you otherwise interact with Atlassian.</p> <p>"<strong>Atlassian Services</strong>" include our:</p> <ol class="def"> <li>Websites</li> <li>SaaS Products</li> <li>Downloadable Products</li> </ol> <p>but does not include:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>Atlassian products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.</li> <li>Third party products. These are third party products or services that you may choose to integrate with Atlassian product or services, such as third party Add-Ons available in the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Marketplace</a>. You should always review the policies of third party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.</li> </ul> <p>A "<strong>Device</strong>" is any computer used to access the Atlassian Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, our SaaS Products and our Downloadable Products are treated the same for the purposes of this document.</p> <p>By registering for or using Atlassian Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Definitions</h2> <p><strong>Add-On</strong>: a bundle of code, resources and configuration files that can be used with an Atlassian product to add new functionality or to change the behavior of that product’s existing features.</p> <p><strong>Atlassian Services</strong>: Atlassian’s Websites, SaaS Products, and Downloadable Products.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: any information or data that you upload, submit, post,&nbsp;create, transmit, store or display in an Atlassian Service.</p> <p><strong>Downloadable Products</strong>: Atlassian’s downloadable software products and mobile applications, including Add-ons created by Atlassian, that are&nbsp;installed by customers on an infrastructure of their choice. Downloadable Products do not include Add-Ons created by third parties, even when they are accessed through Atlassian.com or available through the Atlassian Marketplace.</p> <p><strong>Information</strong>: all of the different forms of data, content, and information collected by us as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Personal Information</strong>: information that may be used to readily identify or contact you as an individual person, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. Personal Information does not include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow for the ready identification of specific individuals.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>SaaS Products</strong>: Atlassian’s "Cloud" hosted solutions, as well as other Atlassian hosted solutions that display a link to this Privacy Policy (such as HipChat and Bitbucket). For the avoidance of doubt, if an Atlassian hosted solution displays a link to a different privacy policy, then that other privacy policy shall apply.</p> <p><strong>Websites</strong>: Atlassian's websites, including but not limited to&nbsp;atlassian.com, marketplace.atlassian.com, answers.atlassian.com, confluence.atlassian.com, support.atlassian.com and any&nbsp;related websites, sub-domains and pages."</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Starting" date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, where appropriate we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the login screen or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use Atlassian Services&nbsp;to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p> <p>If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to stop using Atlassian Services and&nbsp;deactivate your account(s).</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information you provide to us</h2> <p>We collect the following information:</p> <p><strong>Account and Profile Information</strong>: We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account,&nbsp;create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with Atlassian Services&nbsp;(including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). Information we collect includes but is not limited to your name, username, address, email address, phone number, profile photo, job title, or credit card details. You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Atlassian Services,&nbsp;or in some cases another user (such as a system administrator) creating an account on your behalf may provide it (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products).&nbsp;If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you confirm that you have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>:&nbsp;We collect and store Content that you&nbsp;create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using&nbsp;our SaaS Products or Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include (“passively-collected Personal Information”).</p> <p><strong>Other submissions</strong>:&nbsp;We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the Atlassian Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. For example, information regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Atlassian product could be submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums. Any information, including Personal Information, that you submit to our Websites could be visible to the public unless submitted to a secure area in the Website.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information we collect from your use of Atlassian Services</h2> <p><strong>Web Logs</strong>: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and SaaS Products. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. In the case of our SaaS Product, the URLs you accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as elements of Content (such as JIRA project names, project keys, status names, and JQL filters, and Confluence page titles and space names) as necessary for the SaaS Product to perform the requested operations.&nbsp;Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve Atlassian Services for individual customers.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Products</strong>: We collect analytics information when you use our Websites and SaaS Products to help us improve our products and services. In the Saas Products, this analytics information consists of the feature and function of the Atlassian Service being used, the associated license identifier (SEN) and domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the Atlassian Services are being affected. &nbsp;For example:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>In JIRA,&nbsp;analytics information that we collect when a user creates a project includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the project, the project key input by the user, the name of the template used (if any), and the name of the project. &nbsp;Similarly, analytics information that we collect when an issue is edited includes the system-assigned numeric issue id, the issue key (which consists of the project key and a system-generated sequence number), whether the edit is made by a user or automatically generated by the system, and whether email notifications are to be sent.</li> <li>In Confluence, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a page includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the page, the blueprint used to create the page, the key of the space in which the page is being created, and the page title. &nbsp;An example of analytics information that we collect when a user creates a new blueprint includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the blueprint, the key of the space in which the blueprint is being created, and the blueprint name and description.</li> </ul> <p>As shown in the examples above, the analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlassian Service.</p> <p>As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an analytics provider. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/">Google's Policies and Principles</a>. Use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> to prevent to analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information Derived from Content.</strong> Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of workflows that users use (e.g. what percentage of all instances use ITIL style workflows?) by searching for the most common workflow names, or we may query Content to determine the most popular job titles for Confluence users in order to better understand the composition of our user base.</p> <p>Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information from Downloadable Products:</strong>&nbsp;We collect analytics information when you use our Downloadable Products to help us improve our products and services. Our Downloadable Products contain a feature that sends information about the technical operation of the Downloadable Products on your systems ("<strong>System Information</strong>")&nbsp;to us. System Information includes information about (a) the server environment in which the Downloadable Product is operating:&nbsp; OS type and version, JVM version, Java environment properties, CPU type, RAM allocation, language and locale settings, database type and version, and disk utilization, as well as (b) user client information, for example: browser type and version, native client type and version, and client device specifications (e.g. screen resolution, OS version, device type, etc.).&nbsp;In addition, we collect analytics information from Downloadable Products that is a subset of the analytics information described above for Websites and SaaS Products. As with Websites and SaaS Products, the analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing, but with an important caveat. With the Downloadable Products, before sending the information to Atlassian’s servers, we&nbsp;filter the analytics information to remove elements that we believe may contain sensitive or Personal Information. For example: (1) we conduct a one-way hash of usernames and hostnames before collecting them and (2) we filter any Content elements we collect to discard all words except those on a list of common business and IT terminology. You can disable our collection of analytics information from Downloadable Products&nbsp;via the Administrator settings or by blocking collection at the local network level.</p> <p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies that we save to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use cookies to improve and customize Atlassian Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Products without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS Products are most popular.&nbsp;You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our&nbsp;Websites&nbsp;or&nbsp;SaaS Products. We also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Websites or SaaS Products or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.</p> <p><strong>Installer Analytics, Software Updates &amp; License Information from Downloadable Products</strong>: During the installation of our Downloadable Products, the installer sends analytics information to Atlassian to allow us to understand where in the installation process users are experiencing trouble or dropping out. Our Downloadable Products also communicate with Atlassian servers for licensing purposes, as well as to check for updates, patches, and compatibility with Add-Ons. Examples of information we collect for these purposes include the name and version of the Downloadable Product and the server ID, SEN, and IP address of the customer instance.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information we collect from other sources</h2> <p><strong>Information from third party services</strong>: We also obtain information from third parties and combine that with information we collect through Atlassian Services. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into Atlassian Services through the service or otherwise provide us with access to information from the service. Any access that we may have to such information from a third party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service.&nbsp;By authorizing us to connect with a third party service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should check your privacy settings on these third party services to understand and change the information sent to us through these services.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>How we use Information we collect</h2> <p><strong>General Uses.</strong>&nbsp;We use the information we collect about you (including Personal Information to the extent applicable) for a variety of purposes, including to:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>Provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote Atlassian Services;</li> <li>Enable you to access and use Atlassian Services, including uploading, downloading, collaborating on and sharing Content;</li> <li>Process and complete transactions, and send you related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices;</li> <li>Communicate with you, including responding to your comments, questions, and requests; providing customer service and support; providing you with information about services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, promotions, contests and events; providing other news or information about us and our select partners; and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages. Generally, you have the ability to opt out of receiving any promotional communications as described below under “Your Choices”;</li> <li>Process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and rewards;</li> <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with Atlassian Services and for marketing or advertising purposes;</li> <li>Investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to Atlassian Services, and other illegal activities;</li> <li>Personalize Atlassian Services, including by providing content, features, or advertisements that match your interests and preferences;</li> <li>Enable you to communicate, collaborate, and share Content with users you designate; and</li> <li>For other purposes about which we notify you.</li> </ul> <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not use Personal Information appearing in our Analytics Logs or Web Logs for any purpose.</p> <p><strong>Compiling aggregate analytics information</strong>: Because our SaaS Products and Downloadable Products are some of the most configurable in the market, we make extensive use of analytics information (including log and configuration data) to understand how our products are being configured and used, how they can be improved for the benefit of all of our users, and to develop new products and services. As such we generate Usage Data (as defined above) from the web logs and analytics logs described above, including the Content elements captured in such logs,&nbsp;as well as from the Content stored in the Websites and SaaS Products.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information sharing and disclosure</h2> <p>We will not share or disclose any of your Personal Information or Content with third parties except as described in this policy. We do not sell your Personal Information or Content.</p> <p><strong>Your use</strong>:&nbsp;When you use Atlassian Services, Content you provide will be displayed back to you.&nbsp; Certain features of Atlassian Services allow you to make some of your Content public, in which case it will become readily accessible to anyone. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any data you make public.</p> <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>:&nbsp;As a natural result of using Atlassian Services, you may create Content and grant permission to other Atlassian users to access it for the purposes of collaboration. Some of the collaboration features of Atlassian Services display your profile information, including Personal Information included in your profile, to users with whom you have shared your Content. Where this information is sensitive, we urge you to use the various security and privacy features of the Atlassian Services to limit those who can access such information.</p> <p><strong>Access by your system administrator</strong>: You should be aware that the administrator of your instance of Atlassian Services may be able to:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>access information in and about your Atlassian Services account;</li> <li>disclose, restrict, or access information that you have provided or that is made available to you when using your Atlassian Services account, including your Content; and</li> <li>control how your Atlassian Services account may be accessed or deleted.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Atlassian Community</strong>:&nbsp;Our Websites offer publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, bug trackers, and wikis. You should be aware that any Content you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.</p> <p><strong>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others</strong>:&nbsp;We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, back-up, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your Information as part of providing those services for us.</p> <p><strong>Third party applications</strong>:&nbsp;You may choose to make use of third party Add-Ons in conjunction with Atlassian Services. Third party Add-Ons are software written by third parties to which you grant access privileges to your Content (which may include your Personal Information). When access is granted, your Content is shared with the third party. Third party Add-On policies and procedures are not controlled by Atlassian even though the third Party Add-On may be available through Atlassian Services. Third parties who have been granted access to your Content through Add-Ons could use this data to contact you and market services to you, and could share your data with other third parties.

The servers on which Personal Information is stored are kept in a controlled environment. While we take reasonable efforts to guard your Personal Information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.
