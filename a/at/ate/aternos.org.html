        <strong>Welcome to the privacy policy of Aternos,</strong><br>

        We take the protection of your data very seriously and store only what we have to. In this policy, we will try
        to explain as good and comprehensible as possible which data we store and why.
        <br><br>
        If you have any questions regarding your data, you can always write to us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8bfbf9e2fdeae8f2cbeaffeef9e5e4f8a5e4f9eca5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
        <br><br>
        Legally responsible for the protection of your data is the Aternos UG:
        <br><br>
        <strong>Aternos UG (haftungsbeschränkt)</strong><br>
        Heussallee 40<br>
        53113 Bonn<br>
        +49 228 18038354<br>
        <br>
        Represented by: Matthias Neid (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="563b3722223e3f3725163722332438392578392431">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>)
    </div>
</div>
<div>
    <div>
        <h2>Which data do we store and why?</h2>

        After we have clarified this we can now talk about your data that we store: When you sign up you have to enter
        your username, your email address and your password or you link a Google/Facebook account. If you link a
        Google/Facebook account, we save your account identifier and the email address of that account.
        <br><br>
        Usually, your <strong>username</strong> cannot be traced back to you except if it contains your name or if you
        also use it on other platforms. Because of that, we protect your username the same way we protect personal data.
        <br><br>
        We only use your <strong>email address</strong> to reset your password or to reactivate your account after it
        was closed. You receive an email with a link to perform that action in those cases, that have to be executed
        manually on our website. We will never use your email address for a newsletter or anything like that. If you
        sign up through your Google/Facebook account, we only save your email address in case you forgot which email
        address you have used to sign up. We will never send you an email in this case.
        <br><br>
        Your <strong>password</strong> is already concealed on your computer (hash) and will then be stored with more
        security (hash + salt) on our servers. So your password will never reach our servers in plaintext and is extra
        secured.
        <br><br>
        We also save the <strong>point in time</strong> of your registration to create statistics. Besides that, we have
        to save that time to be able to prove that you have accepted this policy.
        <br><br>
        All <strong>settings</strong> of your Minecraft server and all <strong>files</strong> that are created by your
        Minecraft server are saved on our servers. Furthermore, we send this data as a backup to your Google Drive
        account if you want that and have it enabled.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, we store how many and which <strong>players</strong> are currently on your Minecraft server to
        display them on the website in your account and to determine statistics on the total number of players.
        <br><br>
        We basically never save your <strong>IP address</strong> when you use our website. But it is possible, that your
        Minecraft server writes your IP address and the IP addresses of other players into a log file. This log file is
        overwritten on every start and can always be deleted by reinstalling the server. You can always see your log
        file at <a href="https://aternos.org/log/" target="_blank">https://aternos.org/log/</a>.
        <br><br>
        To be able to understand what happened when errors or problems occur we save <strong>miscellaneous
            activities</strong> on our website in a log file, e. g. when you start your server, who enters or leaves
        your server, when you up- or download a world or when you change your email address or password. This data will
        not be processed automatically, it will only be used manually to solve errors or to help you.

        <h2>Your rights</h2>

        We save all mentioned data starting from the registration until you decide to close your account here:
        <a href="https://aternos.org/close/" target="_blank">https://aternos.org/close/</a>
        In doing so, we will delete your data 7 days after the closing to avoid possible issues or to cancel an
        unintended closing. Apart from this, you have the right to complete deletion of your data, but we ask you to use
        the functions mentioned above.
        <br><br>
        You have the right to information about your personal data as well as for correction. Additionally, you can
        limit the processing or contradict it completely. Please contact us with sufficient verification at
        <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b4c4c6ddc2d5d7cdf4d5c0d1c6dadbc79adbc6d39a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, according to §77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you
        believe that the processing of your personal data is illicit.
        <br><br>
        The provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually binding and is optional. If you do not
        agree to this policy, we cannot offer you our services, unfortunately.
        <br><br>
        You are only allowed to agree to this policy if you are at least 16 years old (or less if your country has
        different regulations) or if consent is given by the holder of your parental responsibility.
