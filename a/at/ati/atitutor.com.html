Security of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorized disclosure. We take reasonable security measures to secure your personal information against unauthorized access, loss, use, disclosure, or alteration by third parties and unauthorized employees. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information during its transmission or its storage in our systems. No method of transmitting or storing electronic information is ever completely secure. We make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that your information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any security incidents, and we disclaim all representations and warranties regarding such matters to the fullest extent permitted by law. Where required under law, we will notify you of any loss, misuse or alteration of personal information that may affect you so that you can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of your rights. We review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.</p> <p>If information is transmitted to us using a means that is outside our systems, or if you transmit information to a third party, we cannot guarantee the security of information during transmission. Any such unsecured transmission is at your own risk. We recommend that you use appropriate security measures to protect your information.</p> <p><strong>Correction of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
Accuracy is a top priority for us. You can ensure that any contact data is up-to-date and can correct, update or delete inaccuracies to the information by either logging into your account to review and maintain your information or by contacting customer service. In certain situations, you may need assistance from customer service in making a change. For example, if you realized that your name was misspelled, we may need to take certain steps to verify your identity before making the change, ensure that your name change is linked to all of your records and, in some states or countries, that the oversight agency receives the correction. We will respond to your request to make changes to your records as soon as reasonably possible.</p> <p>We will attempt to answer all requests that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete it as long as we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. </p> <p>In addition, to protect your privacy, we may require you to prove your identity before granting access to, or agreeing to update, correct or delete your personal information.</p> <p>Not all information about you can be changed. For example, we may have records about how much time you spent working in a training module. Although this information is linked to you, it may not be changed and, in certain instances, it may be subject to government or regulatory oversight. Similarly, learning data and assessment scores kept in ATI systems may not be changed by you, although you should contact us if you believe such data is not accurate.</p> <p><strong>Cookies and other Tracking Devices</strong><br>
