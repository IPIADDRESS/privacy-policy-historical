<div>

<p><b>What information will you collect from me?</b></p>

</div>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Because you have consented – in certain situations, we collect and process your personal information with your consent;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>To perform our contract with you;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>To comply with our legal obligations; and</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>For our legitimate business interests, namely to analyse the use of our websites and services to continually improve your customer experience and our business, informing you of our great offers with the ATG Theatre card membership, for direct marketing communications and related profiling to help us offer you relevant products and services, including deciding whether or not to offer you certain products and/or services.</p>
<p><b>Please note that if you choose not to share your personal information with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we may not be able to provide you with some services that you have asked for.</b></p>

<p></p>

<p><b>How and when we collect your personal information</b></p>

<p><b>Collation of personal Information</b></p>

<p>We may collate different categories of information that we collect about you. Where this is the case, and where such collated data amounts to personal information, we will process this data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div>

<p><b>3.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

</div>

<p>We will never sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties without your consent except to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, or as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you:</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Companies within the Group (where necessary to provide our services to you), as sometimes different Group companies can be responsible for different activities;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>The venue in respect of any ticket booking you have made;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Our business partners, suppliers, agents and sub-contractors where necessary to fulfil data processing activities for the purposes listed in this policy on our behalf, for example third parties who provide services to us (e.g. payment processors, delivery companies) or on our behalf (e.g. our ticketing partners); or</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement of our websites and the services we provide.</p>
<p><b>Exceptional circumstances</b></p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if:</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>We undergo a change of control or any of our business or assets are sold or transferred (in which case we may disclose your personal information to the buyer to enable them to continue providing services to you);</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>We are under a duty to disclose or share your information to comply with any legal obligation (for example, a court order); or</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>We need to protect our rights, property, the safety of our website users/customers or to help prevent fraud or crime. This may include exchanging personal information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection or with governmental and law enforcement authorities.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Anonymised and pseudonymised data</b></p>

<p>We may anonymise personal information so that you can no longer be identified from such information. We may also pseudonymise your personal information. This allows us to recognise where multiple behaviours are linked to a certain individual, without seeing any personally identifiable data. You will be able to contact us directly to tell us what you think, have the decision explained, and the opportunity to challenge the resulting decision.</p>

<div>

<p></p>

</div>

<div>

<p><b>4.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>YOUR INFORMATION AND DIRECT MARKETING </b></p>

<p><b>How to stop marketing messages from ATG</b></p>

<p>You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. You can do this:</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any marketing email or sms; or</p>

<p>Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive any further marketing messages. However, please note that it might take a few days for our systems to be updated, so you might continue to receive messages from us whilst we process your request.</p>

<p>Stopping marketing messages from us will not end communications such as updates in relation to your order of tickets or useful information about your visit to one of our events.</p>
<div>

<p><b>5.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>THIRD PARTY LINKS</b></p>

</div>

<div>

<p><b>6.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>HOW WE KEEP AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

</div>

Once the relevant purpose has been satisfied we will securely delete or anonymise your personal information unless we are required to retain a copy of such information under applicable law.</p>

<p><b>Where we store your personal information. </b>All personal information that you provide is stored on our secure servers or those of our suppliers which may be situated outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Your information may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer personal information outside of the EEA we will ensure that adequate contractual safeguards are in place (e.g. the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses or “<b>model clauses</b>”), to ensure the security of your personal information is maintained when it is processed by the third party.</p>

<p></p>

<div>

<p><b>7.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

</div>

<p>We are committed to keeping your personal information secure. We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of all personal information we hold (and endeavour to only work with third parties who provide equivalent protections) in accordance with industry best practices (for example, if you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted to ensure its security). However, please note that there are inherent security implications of disclosing personal information online for which we cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p><b>Account details</b>. You are responsible for keeping the log in details and password in respect of any account you hold with us confidential at all times.</p>
<div>

<p><b>8.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><b>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;A copy of your personal information which we hold about you;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Request that we correct any personal information that is inaccurate or out of date;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Withdraw your consent to processing at any time if we have relied on your consent to process your personal information;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Request in certain circumstances that your personal information is removed from our systems where it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal information;</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Request in certain circumstances that we transmit your personal information that we hold elsewhere (known as “<b>data portability</b>”);</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Object to us processing your personal information. In this instance, we will stop processing your personal information if we are relying on it for our own or someone else’s legitimate interests (except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing), processing it for direct marketing or processing it for research (unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest);</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Restrict the processing of your personal information, if you contest the accuracy of the personal information that we hold about you. This means we must stop any processing activities until we have verified the accuracy of the personal information, or we no longer need your personal information; and</p>

<p>·<span>&nbsp; </span>Contact us directly and be given an explanation about any automated decision-making and profiling that produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you.</p>
