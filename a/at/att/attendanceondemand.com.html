<h1>Attendance on Demand Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Your privacy is important to Attendance on Demand, Inc. ("Attendance on Demand") Please read the following carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we treat it. </p>
<p>By accessing or using this website ("Site") or the products or services offered on or through the Site ("Services"), you agree to this policy. This policy may be changed from time to time and your continued use of the Website or Services is deemed to be acceptance of such changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. </p>
<p>In order to improve Services, our Site may gather information about you and the pages you visit. This policy explains how this may happen, how we may use information collected about you and how you can contact us to request correction of such information.</p>
<h3>Personal Data Information Collected</h3>
<p>In order to access the Services, you may be asked to provide information that allows you to be identified as a particular person, such as your name, your address or phone number ("Personal Data").We collect certain types of Personal Data when you register for a white paper or contact us. This Personal Data may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>your address</li>
  <li>your phone number</li>
  <li>your email address</li>
  <li>your company</li>
</ul>
<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including without limitation, your acknowledgement and agreement that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to offices and servers of Attendance on Demand and/or those third party providers with whom we have a relationship, including analytics and advertising partners ("Service Providers"), and to our affiliates, employees and contractors located in the United States and other countries. </p>
<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>Attendance on Demand, or its Service Providers may send a&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;to your computer or use web beacons&nbsp;to gather statistical information.  Neither cookies nor web beacons personally identify you. A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which is then stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer. When a visitor accesses certain pages on the Site an anonymous notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our Service Providers. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of the Site are of interest to you and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Site. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.</p>
<p>If you never provide us with Personal Data, then your visits – despite us using cookies or web beacons – are anonymous. We don't know the actual person linked with the cookie or web beacon.</p>
<p>If you do provide Personal Data, then we could potentially link that with your cookie, then gather the visits with web beacons and understand how you personally have acted when visiting the Site.</p>
<p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. If you turn off cookies, web beacon technology will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or Personal Data and are disregarded. </p>
<h3>How We May Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We will only disclose your Personal Data and other information collected on our Site or through the use of the Services in one of the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With your consent.</li>
  <li>To our employees, contractors, affiliates, business partners and Service Providers relating to the Services offered on or through the Site, each of which are under contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality of such information.</li>
  <li>Pursuant to applicable law or regulation or in response to a subpoena or an order of a court or government agency.</li>
  <li>To establish, exercise, or defend against legal claims of an individual or Attendance on Demand, including in order to protect the safety of an individual or to protect Attendance on Demand's rights and/or property.</li>
  <li>To a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of Attendance on Demand: (i) in the event of a reorganization or restructuring, or (ii) for use and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
  <li>In connection with a change of ownership or control, including, without limitation, a merger or an acquisition of any or all of Attendance on Demand's business assets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Third Party Monitoring</h3>
<p>Third-party vendors, including Google (www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), show Attendance on Demand ads on sites across the Internet. Third-party vendors, including Google, may use cookies and/or web beacons to serve ads based on past visits to our website. You may opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policies of Third Parties</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by Attendance on Demand. Other websites that may be accessible through this Site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Our affiliates and business partners have their own privacy policies too. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statement/policies provided by all third parties prior to providing them with information.</p>
