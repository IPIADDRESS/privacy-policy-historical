<p align="center"><strong>Important Notice:</strong> <a href="http://worldnet.attecc.com/bulletins/policy.html">Updated Privacy Policy</a>
<br>
Effective July 1, 2001</p>

<p><strong>Customer Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>Protecting privacy is not a new endeavor for AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T has a long-standing
tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy of customers who use its
telecommunications networks. The company maintains strict customer information
privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard customer
information and communications from unauthorized intrusions.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T recognizes that the growth of online services, including Internet
services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly for consumers.</p>

<p>Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer identifiable"
information which an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept
private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information
which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example,
a customer's name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information
about online activities that are directly linked to them.</p>
<p>It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other
organizations to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct
business and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect
customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a
variety of other information in the course of billing and providing telephone service
to a customer.</p>

<p>Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers signing
up for an Internet access service, for example, are usually asked to provide name,
address, telephone number and credit card and other information that is typical
when the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, business web sites may
ask visitors to supply information about themselves, particularly when information,
services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better target
the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.</p>

<p><strong>AT&amp;T's Online Privacy Policy: Informed Choice</strong></p>

<p>AT&amp;T has put in place the following Online Privacy Policy to
protect customer identifiable information.  This policy covers AT&amp;T
and its subsidiaries, except as follows, and applies to all customer
identifiable information that AT&amp;T obtains when a customer registers
for or uses an AT&amp;T online service, including visiting an AT&amp;T
owned and controlled web site ("AT&amp;T Web Site"). This policy
does not apply to AT&amp;T's recent acquisition of Telecommunications Inc.
("TCI", <a href="http://www.tci.com/">www.tci.com</a>).
We are currently evaluating TCI's privacy policy. Universal Card Services Corp. ("UCS"), now a subsidiary of Citibank,
N.A., has its own privacy promise that applies to customer identifiable
information that is collected at its website
(<a href="http://www.att.com/ucs/">www.att.com/ucs/</a>). AT&amp;T will continue to
protect customer information derived from its
local, long distance, cable and wireless services consistent with federal
laws and with federal regulations issued by the Federal Communications
Commission.</p>

<p><strong>AT&amp;T protects online customer identifiable information as follows:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> AT&amp;T will not sell, trade, or disclose to
third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration
for or use of an AT&amp;T online service -- including customer names and addresses
-- without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search
warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the
customer or others). When AT&amp;T uses other agents, contractors or companies
to perform services on its behalf, AT&amp;T will ensure that the company protects
your customer identifiable information consistent with this Policy. If AT&amp;T
includes your name and any other customer identifiable information in a directory
that AT&amp;T creates from information we receive as an online service provider,
the company will give you the opportunity to have your information excluded from
that directory.  Business directories that AT&amp;T creates may, however, contain
information obtained from other sources.</p>

<p><strong>Collection and Use:</strong> AT&amp;T will collect and use customer
identifiable information for billing
purposes, to provide and change service, to anticipate and
resolve problems with your service, or to create
and inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This
means that AT&amp;T may use your customer identifiable information, in
conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new
services to you that we think will be of interest to you, but we will not
disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want
to market products to you.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Choice:</strong> A customer may choose not to receive 
direct marketing communications from AT&amp;T in connection with AT&amp;T 
online services.  Upon such choice, AT&amp;T (a) will not contact that 
customer directly with marketing messages about AT&amp;T online services, 
and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from 
that customer's registration for or use of an online service to 
contact that customer with marketing messages about any AT&amp;T 
products or services.  A customer may choose not to receive such 
messages by e-mail, by mail, or by telephone.</p>

<p><strong>For information and instructions about how to make this choice...
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Click <a href="/privacy/consumer">here</a> if 
you are a consumer.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Click <a href="/privacy/business">here</a> if you are a 
business customer.
</strong></p>

<p>Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at one 
of the AT&amp;T Web Sites to order AT&amp;T services other than online 
services will be protected just as if the information had been provided 
under more traditional ways of ordering that service.</p>

<p><strong>Collection of Usage Data:</strong> AT&amp;T servers 
automatically gather information about which sites customers visit 
on the Internet and which pages are visited within an AT&amp;T Web Site.  
The company does not use that information except in the aggregate.</p>

<p><strong>Security:</strong> AT&amp;T has implemented technology and 
security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy 
of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or 
improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures 
as new technology becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>E-mail Contents:</strong> The company will not read or 
disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are 
transmitted using AT&amp;T services except as required to operate the 
service or as otherwise authorized by law.</p>

<p><strong>Improper Conduct:</strong> AT&amp;T may also use customer 
identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially 
unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise 
violates the customer agreement for that service.</p>

<p><strong>Account Information:</strong> AT&amp;T honors requests from 
customers for account information, for example, name, address, or billing 
information, and will correct any such information which may be 
inaccurate.  Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have 
been made.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Concerns:</strong>If you are a consumer with concerns 
about the AT&amp;T online privacy policy or its implementation you may 
contact us at 1-888-9-ATT-WEB. If you are a business customer, please 
call 1-877-744-4531. Concerns about the UCS Privacy Promise should be 
directed to UCS at 1-800-423-4343.</p>

<p>
AT&amp;T also participates in the BBB<em>OnLine</em><sup>®</sup>
Privacy Program. Further information about this program is available at
<strong><a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/">www.bbbonline.org</a>.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Changes in Practices:</strong> AT&amp;T will keep this 
Policy current.   The company will inform you of any changes that we make.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the 
Internet</strong></p>

<p>AT&amp;T joins the industry in recognizing that children, including 
young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal 
information requested online.</p>

<p>Accordingly, AT&amp;T does not target children or teenagers (younger 
than eighteen years of age) for collection of information online.   
AT&amp;T does not solicit or collect customer identifiable information 
targeted at children and teenagers under eighteen and does not allow 
anyone else to do so on an AT&amp;T Web Site.  In addition, the 
editorial content of AT&amp;T Web Sites designed for children will 
not knowingly promote or link to any third party web site that collects 
customer identifiable information unless that web site  publishes a 
privacy policy that is easily accessible.</p>

<p>In addition, on all of its online services and AT&amp;T Web Sites, 
AT&amp;T will encourage children to seek the consent of their parents 
before providing any information about themselves or their households 
to anyone on the Internet.</p>

<p>Finally, AT&amp;T encourages parents to take an active role to 
protect the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the 
inappropriate use of information about their children.  AT&amp;T 
supports the development of technologies that help parents to control 
the collection and use of personal information from children who use 
online services in their households.</p>
