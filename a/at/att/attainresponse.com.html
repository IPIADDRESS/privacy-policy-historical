          <hr>
          <p>At AttainResponse, LLC. ("AttainResponse" or "Service Provider"), we respect our Users' and Clients' right to privacy with regards to the use of their email and our Web sites. We have adopted a privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") that we hope provides the greatest possible privacy to our Users and Clients, assuming they are not using our services to conduct unlawful activities. Our Privacy Policy makes the following commitments: </p>
          <p>WE WILL NOT USE CLIENT OR USER INFORMATION FOR ANY PURPOSES OTHER THAN TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE HOSTED EMAIL, EMAIL MARKETING, ON DEMAND STREAMING MEDIA AND RELATED SERVICES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL NOT SHARE USER OR CLIENT INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IN WAYS OTHER THAN DISCLOSED IN THIS POLICY. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL NOT EMPLOY TECHNOLOGY TO READ EMAIL MESSAGES IN ORDER TO TARGET, DISPLAY OR SEND MARKETING ADS BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THOSE EMAIL MESSAGES. </p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the types of personal information collected and stored by Service Provider and how that information is used to provide the email services and related sales and support services ("Email Services"). Client acknowledges and agrees to the collection and use of its personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. <br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style2">Website Information</span><br>
  Service Provider collects statistical information about how people ("Users") locate and navigate its Web sites. This information, sent by normal Web browsers, usually includes the browser type, Internet Protocol (IP) address and referring URL. This information is used to improve the usefulness of the Web sites and to enhance the positioning of Web sites within Internet search engines. Users remain anonymous unless they voluntarily contact Service Provider by filling out an online form, at which point this data may be linked with Users in order to provide the best possible service. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Demonstration email accounts.</span> Web site Users  may request a fully functional demo account by filling out an online form. This form requires a valid email address and phone number so that Service Provider can contact User by email or phone to confirm potential fit of the email solution and to provide User with the demo account password. Service Provider does not use submitted demo request form data for any purpose other than to contact Users regarding the demo. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Contact information.</span> When Users fill out an online form to contact Service Provider, Service Provider collects some personal information, including but not limited to name, company name, phone number, email address, and reason for contact. This information is used to respond to the customer's initial contact in a timely manner. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Affiliate information.</span> When Users fill out an online form to apply for the Service Provider's affiliate program, Service Provider collects some personal information, including but not limited to name, company name, title, phone number, address, email address and tax ID number. This information is used to help Service Provider determine whether or not Users qualify for entry into the program. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Cookies.</span> A cookie is a small piece of information that a Web server can store temporarily with a Web browser. Cookies are useful for having a browser remember specific information that the Web server can later retrieve. <br>
            When Users visit Service Provider owned Web sites, a cookie is set on their browser for the purpose of gathering statistical data about how the Service Provider Web sites are being used. The use of cookies improves the quality of the Web sites, however if Users prefer, they may configure their browser not to accept cookies. Web browsers that do not accept cookies will still be able to access some of the Service Provider sites. Cookies are tied to Users' personal information only when a purchase is made, a demo is requested, or a contact form is filled out. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Third Party Cookies.</span> Some of the businesses we advertise with use cookies on our Web site to help us determine the effectiveness of our Web site content and advertising. We have no control over third party cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by AttainResponse, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. The information that these companies collect and share through this technology is not personally identifiable. This sub-section on Third Party Cookies only applies to the Web Site Information section of this Privacy Policy and DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CLIENT  ACCOUNT INFORMATION section. More specifically, we do not use Third Party Cookies when providing Email Services to Clients. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs).</span> Some of the businesses we advertise with employ a software technology called clear gifs (i.e. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us determine the effectiveness of our Web site content and advertising. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on Users' computer hard drives, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. This sub-section on Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) only applies to the Web Site Information section of this Privacy Policy and DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CLIENT  ACCOUNT INFORMATION section. More specifically, we do not use Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) when providing Services to Clients. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Choice/Opt-out.</span> Prior to signing up for our services, we collect personally identifiable information when creating a demonstration  account, when contacting our staff, when requesting customer support and when applying for our affiliate program. We only collect personally identifiable information that is voluntarily submitted via our online Web site forms. WE WILL ONLY CONTACT USERS WHEN A REQUEST FOR CONTACT OR A FULLY FUNCTIONAL DEMO ACCOUNT HAS BEEN MADE. Users have the option of opting out of future communications by informing the company representative that contacts them, by emailing <a href="mailto:support@attainresponse.com">support@attainresponse.com</a>, by calling our support line at 303.469.5945 or by postal mail at the address listed below. <br>
          </p>
          <p><span class="style2">Client and User  Account Information</span><br>
            When people sign up and pay for  Services ("Clients"), Service Provider collects some personal information, including but not limited to name, phone number, billing address, payment information and password. A secret question and answer may also be asked in order to verify the identity of Clients if their account password is lost. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Information Safeguards.</span> WE WILL NOT USE CLIENT INFORMATION FOR ANY PURPOSES OTHER THAN TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE HOSTED EMAIL, EMAIL MARKETING, ON DEMAND STREAMING MEDIA AND RELATED SERVICES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL NOT SHARE CLIENT INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IN WAYS OTHER THAN DISCLOSED IN THIS POLICY. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL NOT EMPLOY TECHNOLOGY TO READ EMAIL MESSAGES IN ORDER TO TARGET, DISPLAY OR SEND MARKETING ADS BASED ON THE CONTENT OF THOSE EMAIL MESSAGES. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Support information.</span> When Clients fill out an online form to make a request for customer support, Service Provider collects some personal information, including but not limited to name, company name, phone number, email address, domain name and description of the inquiry. This information is used to open a trouble ticket so that Service Provider can remedy the issue as quickly as possible. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Cookies.</span> When Clients use Service Provider AttainResponse services, a cookie is set on their browser for security authentication purposes. Client sensitive information IS NOT stored within these cookies, unless Clients specifically select the "Remember my info" check box on the AttainResponse login page located at www.attainresponse.com. If Clients prefer, they may configure their browser not to accept cookies. When browsers are configured not to accept cookies, Email Services will still be available via POP3 and IMAP4 standard protocols, however, for security reasons the AttainResponse applications will not be available. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Email contents.</span> The contents of Clients' email accounts are stored on Service Provider servers in order to provide the Email Services. This information is stored on secure servers, which process the information in order to provide Clients with authenticated access to their mailbox receive and transmit email messages and prevent unsolicited bulk email ("Spam"). Email contents are backed up to separate storage systems daily for the purpose of recovery from errors or system failure. Copies of email messages may remain on the backup storage systems for approximately two (2) weeks, even after Clients delete the emails from their mailbox or after termination of Email Services. Service Provider employees do not access the content of any mailboxes unless Clients specifically request them to do so (e.g., when Clients report difficulties using their account), or if required to do so by law, or if Service Provider in good faith believes that such action is necessary to protect, maintain and defend the rights and property of Service Provider, its Clients or the public. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Special Email Addresses.</span> All domains on the Internet are required to have a "postmaster" and "abuse" mailbox pursuant to certain industry regulations, specifically RFC 2821 and RFC 2142. To help Clients comply with this regulation, Service Provider automatically accepts mail for the following addresses within all domains hosted on the Service Provider Network: </p>
          <p>abuse@example.com - delivers to abuse@attainresponse.us <br>
            postmaster@example.com - delivers to root@example.com <br>
            root@example.com - delivers to an unmonitored mailbox </p>
          <p>These special email addresses must always exist, however Clients may request to have these addresses forward to alternate mailboxes within their domain. Service Provider employees monitor the emails that arrive to abuse@attainresponse.com solely for the purpose of following up on abuse related complaints from Internet users and ISPs. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Log information.</span> Clients are provided with detailed usage statistics regarding their Email, Email Marketing and Streaming Services. To provide this information, and to facilitate troubleshooting of problems, Service Provider collects certain information relating to the usage of the  Services. This information is stored in server logs and includes, but is not limited to, usage of SMTP, POP3, IMAP, AttainResponse, Attainmail, Spam Filtering and Virus Scanning. This information is also aggregated in order to generate system wide usage totals, which are used to effectively scale the system infrastructure and improve the quality of the  Services. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Agents.</span> We use an outside credit card processing company to bill Clients for Services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Business Transitions.</span> In the event that Service Provider goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email as well as through a prominent notice on our Web site and control panel of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information for at least 30 days. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Access to Personally Identifiable Information.</span> If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your account in our control panel, by emailing <a href="mailto:support@attainresponse.com">support@attainresponse.com</a>, by calling our support line at 303.469.5945 or by postal mail at the address listed below. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Security.</span> Service Provider has put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information that is collected. Various security technologies have been implemented to ensure that external parties cannot access or modify Clients' personal information on the Service Provider Network. Specifically, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption is used on specific Web pages to safeguard online purchase transactions. SSL technology is the industry standard protocol for secure, Web-based communications. SSL is used by e-commerce Web sites on the Internet to enable secure transactions between customers and suppliers. A limited number of employees are authorized to access Clients' information when the need to do so arises, and those employees undergo thorough background checks and are trained on the importance of maintaining Clients' privacy. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Children's Privacy.</span> AttainResponse is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. AttainResponse does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and does not target its Web sites or  Services to children under the age of 13. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Release of Personal Information in Extraordinary Circumstances.</span> Except as provided for in this Privacy Policy, Service Provider will never share Clients' personal information with third parties without Clients' express permission unless extraordinary circumstances apply. With respect to the release of personal information, extraordinary circumstances may exist when the disclosure of such information is legally required or requested by a governmental entity, or when Service Provider, acting in good faith, believes that the disclosure of such information is necessary to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process, protect the rights of Service Provider, prevent a crime or protect national security, or protect the personal safety of its Clients or the public. </p>
          <p><span class="boldtext9pt">Privacy Policy Changes.</span> If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, our Web site, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. </p>
          <p>We value your opinions and feedback. If you have comments or questions about our Privacy Policy, please email <a href="mailto:privacy-matters@attainresponse.com">privacy-matters@attainresponse.com</a> or send them to: </p>
