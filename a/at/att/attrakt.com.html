<h2 class="box-subtitle">
3. Typology of the treated data and treatment aim
</h2>
<div class="box-question1">
<ol class="question-left tipologiadati">
<li><strong>Navigation data</strong> The computer systems and the software procedures used for the Site functioning acquire, in the standard activity and in the respect of the treatment methods and of the data requirements according to paragraph 11 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003, some personal data which are sent implicitly in the internet communication protocols use. These is data which by nature, through associations or elaborations with data in property of third parties, could identify the user/visitors (for instance, IP addresses, domain names used by the users/visitors connected to the Site, etc.) (so-called “identification data”). On the other hand, no so-called “sensitive data” is requested. This data is used only with the aim of obtaining statistical information (so anonymous) and for controlling the correct Site functioning. Immediately after the elaboration, said data is deleted. The data concerning the web contacts are stored, for no more than seven days - a time span strictly necessary that respects Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003 - in a database with exclusive disposition of the treatment owner, except in the case of investigations by the competent Authorities concerning computer crimes damaging said Site. Any data coming from the web service will be communicated or published, except in case of fulfillment of duties provided in laws, regulations or UE provisions.</li> 
<li><strong>Data voluntarily given by the users/visitors (so-called "interested people")</strong>. In case the users/visitors, connecting to the Site send their own personal data to access services, or, to send requests by email, this data will be acquired by Attrakt and/or third parties with whom Attrakt may provide the service requested by the user /visitor; this data will be treated exclusively in response to the request, or to provide the service according to this privacy policy and the specific privacy notices communicated at the moment of adherence to specific services. The personal data expressly sent by the users/visitors will be communicated to third parties only in case said communication is necessary to comply the requests of the users/visitors, except what is contained in the privacy notice relative to each specific service.</li> 
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> The Site uses cookies or markers, which technically are information packages sent by a web server (in this case, from the Site) to the visitor/user’s internet browser and by this one automatically saved in the personal computer and automatically sent back at the time the user accesses the Site.</li> 
</ol>
<span class="question-left">
<br>
Therefore, for a complete use of the Site, it is recommended to set up the browser so that it accepts the reception of cookies. We inform you that the defaults of nearly all web browsers are set up for accepting cookies automatically. The visitors/users can modify the default setup, which for Internet Explorer version 6.0 is the medium one, thus disabling cookies (definitely), by setting the highest security level of "Privacy" (which is reachable by selecting the heading "Tools" - "Internet Options"), or deleting cookies in the personal computer by clicking the heading "Tools" - "Internet options" - "General" and choosing "Delete cookies".<br>
As hereinbefore described, however, the disapplication or the deletion of cookies could preclude the successful use of some of the Site areas or compromise the use of the services under authentication. If the users/visitors want to decide whether or not to accept cookies each time, they can set up their own browser in order to create a saved cookie notice. The used cookies are both lasting (meaning they are saved until their deadline on the hard disk of the user/visitor’s personal computer) and relative to the specific session (meaning they are not saved lastingly in the user/visitor’s personal computer and vanish with the browser closing).<br>
Lasting cookies are used in order to simplify the navigation in the Site and its correct use, to simplify access to the services which require the authentication (avoiding the users sending elements of authentication at each access to services) and for statistical aims in order to know which Site areas have been visited, and, in certain cases, for an optimal management of the pages and of the advertisement spaces or to provide contents and advertisements according to net surfers’ choices. The cookies relative to each session are used in order to send the session identification elements which are necessary to permit a safe and efficient exploration of the Site.<br>
The cookies relative to each session used in the Site avoid using other computer methods potentially dangerous for the privacy of users/visitors’ navigation and are used even for improving the provision of the services. Furthermore, cookies can be peculiar to the Site (for instance, used in order to know the number of pages visited within the Site) or belonging to third parties (meaning they can be made by other sites to provide the content of the site visited). The Site uses third party cookies in order to manage in a dynamical and developed way the provision of advertisements and the traffic analysis, through services provided by the company Google Inc. (hereinafter "Google"): Google Adsense.<br>      
The most common browsers provide the possibility of stopping exclusively third party cookies, accepting only the ones peculiar to the Site. Furthermore, some companies which create cookies on the third party sites, offer the possibility of disabling or stopping in a simple and immediate way only their cookies, even when those are anonymous or they do not entail the registration of identification personal data (for instance, the IP address), in respect to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a>. In order to disable Google cookies please follow the instructions in the page <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/privacy/ads</a>.
