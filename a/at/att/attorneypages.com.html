		<h2>Privacy Statement for AttorneyPages</h2>
        
        <p>AttorneyPages.com, recognized as a leading online directory of attorneys and lawyers, respects the privacy of visitors to our site. AttorneyPages.com is a unit of Advice Company, which has been a leading provider of information on the Internet since 1995.</p>
 
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below by emailing <a href="mailtp:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a>.</p>

<p>We invite you to explore AttorneyPages.com and its affiliated legal websites, including the leading consumer law and insurance information website <a href="http://www.FreeAdvice.com/" target="_blank">FreeAdvice.com</a>, and our national expert witness and litigation consultant directory <a href="http://ExpertPages.com/" target="_blank">ExpertPages.com</a>.</p>

<h2 align="left">Information This Site Gathers / Tracks</h2>

<p align="left">The information gathered by this website falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our website when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our site. Third party providers featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.</p>

<p>To make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, to help visitors navigate between sections, to tailor content to each visitor?s apparent needs and interests, and to measure traffic to and within our site, our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. They also invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides on your computer. The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site.</p>

<p>
Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. Our cookies can't read unrelated data from your computer. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our sites, including companies such as Google? that provides our web analytics platform, may also assign their own cookies to your browser. Those cookies may gather additional information, and combine it with information already in their databases, but we don't control their cookies or their processes, nor do they share the information they may gather about any specific visitor with us.</p>

<p>
To make use of certain features on this website (such as to list on this website, to ask a question or make a comment, or request a report) visitors may need to register and/or to provide certain information as part of the registration, request or comment process. We may also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our websites. We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, phone number, street address, gender, age, city or town, zip code, educational and professional background, and for those who seek to purchase a product or service, credit card number. We sometimes request information on your interest in other topics.</p>

<p>
The information you supply may help us to meet your request, qualify you as a participant, offer you more personalized features, or tailor our site to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without registration. The vast majority of our site does NOT require visitors to complete a registration form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit.</p>

<p>
The more we know about our visitors the more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may be unable to provide you with some services we make available to other visitors to our sites. We can't send you targeted email alerting you to a relevant new service we're offering, or articles on topics of interest to you, if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email address. Similarly, we can't accommodate a request, send you a report that you may want, or if we run a promotional contest, notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize if we don't know how to contact you. Such personal information is gathered by us only with our users` knowing and active permission and participation.</p>

<p>
As a matter of general policy and practice, we do not sell or exchange visitors? individual personal data with other companies. At times, we may aggregate various demographic and profile data collected at our site, and share that data with advertisers and others on an aggregate basis, without any personally identifiable information. In addition, and notwithstanding our general policy and practice, when a visitor voluntarily provides information when completing a form on or connected from our website, or uses links on our website to seek to contact, connect or consult with an attorney, insurer, agent, broker, expert or other professional, or to a provider of goods (such as legal forms) or services, directly or via a third party, we pass along some or all of the personal information voluntarily provided by the visitor at that time. We may be  compensated, by way of an advertising, lead generation, transaction or similar fee, for our generating such contact, connection, consultation or transaction, and passing along such personal information. Under no circumstances do we share in any attorney's fee, insurance producer?s fee, or similar fee.</p>

<p>
We collect financial information (like credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit card or other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the user for products and services and to send orders.</p>

<p>
We also use customer contact information from the various registration forms, opt-in features, and service features to send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</p>

<p>
As this privacy policy reaffirms, we strive to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right to use customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules, or lawful orders of courts and governmental agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions for use of our sites, or to protect third parties from what we regard as threats of serious harm.
</p>

<h2 align="left">Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p align="left">This site contains links to many other sites. The establishment of a link does not mean that our site has approved or is endorsing a site, has reviewed its content, or is in any manner recommending a visit. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of linked web sites.</p>

<h2 align="left">Third Party Features</h2>

<p align="left">Certain features of and portions on our sites may also be the result of special relationships, such as "Powered By" or Co-Branding or affiliate programs, entered into with various publishers, form providers, and retailers. These firms share varying amounts of information with us. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of such providers before providing information to them.</p>

<h2 align="left">Advertising and Cookies</h2>

<p align="left">Our sites display advertising and we also work with several unaffiliated companies that serve ads when you visit portions of our sites. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with such banner or other ads are collected by our advertisers and/or ad companies and we do not have access to information they collect.</p>

<p align="left">These companies may use that information (which to the best of our knowledge, information and belief does not include your name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit card number ? unless you enter such information into their company forms) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and about other sites and goods and services that they think may be of interest to you.</p>

<h2 align="left">Public Forums</h2>

<p align="left">This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. We do reserve the right to delete any postings at any time.</p>
  
<h2 align="left">Security</h2>

<p align="left">We have numerous security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. The measures include passwords, linkages to secure servers, encryption, backups, conventional locks and alarm systems, and use of Internet Service Providers and facilities we believe are secure and trustworthy. However, we cannot guarantee that the measures in place have been, are now, or will remain adequate.</p>

<h2 align="left">Children's Guidelines</h2>

<p align="left">This website is directed at adults, not children, and we do not seek to collect from children online contact information, or distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information from children, or entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize, or other activity, to divulge information to us. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to provide any other personally identifying information without written approval of a parent or guardian.</p>

<h2 align="left">Choice/Opt-Out</h2>

<p align="left">Our site often provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from this site. For example, our Newsletters have links or return addresses for recipients to direct that they unsubscribe. For specifics concerning a matter impacting you, you can send email to the Officer in charge of Privacy Matters at <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a> or by mail to the following postal address: AttorneyPages.com, a unit of Advice Company, <em>PO Box 1739, Sausalito, CA 94966</em>.</p>

<h2 align="left">Do Not Track</h2>

<p align="left">?Do Not Track? is a web browser mechanism triggered by the user to opt-out of web tracking over time and across websites. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based ?Do Not Track? signals, we do not currently respond to undefined ?DNT? signals.</p>

<h2 align="left">Revisions / Corrections / Updates</h2>

<p align="left">We reserve the right to change our privacy policy from time-to-time on a prospective basis. If we do change our privacy policy in the future, we'll post the changes when they take effect.</p>

<p align="left">This site gives users options for changing and modifying information previously provided, often at the feature on which the user registered. For specifics concerning a matter impacting you, you can send email to <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a>, or by mail to the following postal address: AttorneyPages.com, a unit of Advice Company, <em>PO Box 1739, Sausalito, CA 94966</em>.</p>

<h2 align="left">Contacting the Web Site</h2>

<p align="left">If you have any questions about this privacy statement, which is effective May 30, 2014, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact</p>
