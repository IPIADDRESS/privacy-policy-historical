<h3 align="center" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><font face="Arial">Advice Company
Privacy Statement</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">AttorneyPages.com is a unit of the Advice
Company, and has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and
dissemination practices for the AttorneyPages.com website. Questions regarding
this statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></span></font></p>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">
<h4><font face="Arial">Advice Company Privacy Policy</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Advice Company is a leading provider of information and
advice on the Internet and e-commerce solutions for individuals and businesses.
We invite you to explore our Web site and find out what all the talk is about.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The Advice Company's Web site logs IP addresses and
browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally
identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user
will be anonymous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can browse our site without entering any personal
information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope
that all of our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about
our valuable customers and keep them updated with our monthly newsletter. Our
registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and various
types of demographic information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We encourage all visitors to register with Advice Company.
Your name and email address are used to send you our newsletter containing news
about the subjects you and fellow readers have asked us about. If you would
rather not receive the newsletter, but would still like to register, please
indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box presented on the
registration form. Occasionally, we like to present you with special offers from
our partners. This involves sharing your information with them so they can send
you the offer. If you prefer, you can choose that your information not be shared
with our partners by indicating your preference on the registration form.
Preferences and demographic information is used to help us improve our service
and products. The more we know about you, the better we can serve you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign In", or
request our Free online newsletter, use the Tell a Friend feature, complete a
Visitor Survey, enter our contests, request information from us, or choose to
use the FreeAdvice Live! feature. If so, we may on our own behalf send you
Email, copies of our Free newsletters or surveys. (We would delete your Email
address on request.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you choose to request a Consultation from an attorney
listed on AttorneyPages' Lawyer Directory, you may do so directly by telephone,
by fax, by mail or by using the online Request Form. As the Request Form states,
you should NOT send any attorney any confidential information until and unless
the attorney asks you to do so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you choose to use the online Request Form, your message
is typically transmitted directly to the attorney by Email or through an
independent provider's "Email to Fax service". We can take no
responsibility for the transmission or delivery of any such message. A copy of
most messages sent via the Request Form is sent to our archives, where it may be
used on a confidential basis solely for Advice Company's own purposes, such as
to determine traffic flow, attorney responsiveness or visitor satisfaction.
Advice Company will maintain the confidentiality of any request from its end of
the Internet to the fullest extent permitted by law.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If a visitor, within a short period of time, sends
multiple copies of a similar message using a Request Form, or tries to evade our
programs designed to prevent the sending of multiple messages, our systems or
staff may alert us and/or some or all of the attorneys to that fact to enable
the attorneys to take that into account in determining whether or not to reply
or grant a Consultation. We may also bar the visitor from future use of the
Websites or any of its features.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">FreeAdvice.com and AttorneyPages.com NEVER require reports
from attorneys on who contacts them through our Websites, or who becomes a
client, or the nature or specifics of any matter. FreeAdvice.com and
AttorneyPages.com are publishers, and not "legal referral bureaus" nor
law firms, and NEVER receive any portion of any attorney's fees should you
become a client of any attorney.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The only other place that we collect personal information
on our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing information such as
name, postal address, email address and credit card number should you decide to
place an order online.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The Advice Company Web site logs IP addresses for systems
administration purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve the
value of the materials available on the website.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Surveys, Bulletin Boards and FreeAdvice Live!</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">Our
online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address)
and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use
contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company.
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is
shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</span></font></p>
<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'">
<h4><font face="Arial">Posting information on the Site</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Our FreeAdvice Live! feature allows visitors to chat
directly with a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> an Advice Company participating
professional. Visitors can sign on using an assumed name, but if they do
identify themselves, by giving their email, name, address or other identifying
information, the Company may use that information to contact you.</span></font></p>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
<p><font face="Arial">The Company maintains special relationships, such as
"Powered by CommTouch" and "Powered by LivePerson" with
various partners, business partners, and operated several co-branded sites. The
operators of the co-branded sites may gather additional information; the Company
sometimes has access to some or all of the information, and the Company's
partner's use of the information is not within the Company's control.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Advice Company Order Form</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">The information that we require on our order form is only
used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will
only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing
information will only be used to bill you for that product. This information may
be used for marketing purposes by Advice Company. The customer's contact
information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may
opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">For those visitors who register with Advice Company, we
share your name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with
select partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as
mentioned above, you may tell us that you don't want your information shared, in
which case we will of course respect your wishes. Please see the Opt-out section
below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The information that you submit on the order form (contact
and billing information) is never shared with any third parties, including our
partners.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Security</font></h4>
</span></span></span><p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial">When you place an order online, your personal information
and credit card information are scrambled using encryption technology before
being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your
information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through
cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until we're ready
to process it. In addition, we erase your credit card information from our web
site database so it isn't connected to</font></span></span></span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font face="Arial">the
Internet, and is therefore safe from "hackers."</font></span></p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">
<h4><font face="Arial">Links</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Advice Company websites contain links to other Web sites.
Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites. We
encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any
Web site.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Cookies</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Our site uses cookies to keep track of items in your
shopping cart and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience. With
the help of cookies, we can present you with customized content and ads that
will be of more interest to you. We also use cookies in our bbs-forums to
remember your passwords for you so you don't have to re-enter them each time you
visit the site. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies.
However, if certain cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't
be able to keep items in your cart.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Advertiser Cookies</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">You may be served cookies from our advertisers or
advertising agencies while visiting our site. We do not control, nor do we have
access to any of the information they may collect.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Opt-out Policy</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">If at any time after registering, you change your mind
about receiving the newsletter or sharing your information with third parties,
you may send your requests to: Advice Company Privacy Manager,
admin@adviceco.com</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Correcting/Updating</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">If you would like to correct and/or update your
registration information, please contact: Advice Company Customer Services, <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">General Advice</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">Finally, although Advice Company has a very strong Privacy
Protection policy on our end, and does its utmost to protect privacy of all
visitors, we bear no responsibility for anyone else's conduct with respect to
material you transmit. As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY
Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone else has access to
your computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may
be possible for that "someone else" or the "network"
operator to retrieve copies of Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace
the places you have been visiting on the Internet.</font></p>
<h4><font face="Arial">Amendments</font></h4>
<p><font face="Arial">We may amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective basis
(i.e., for future visits) at any time by posting a revised policy on our Web
site. Further, nothing in this Privacy Policy is designed to protect the privacy
of visitors whose use of the Company's Websites is, in the reasonable opinion of
Advice Company or its attorneys, intended for illegal, improper or abusive
purposes, for purposes of marketing or solicitation, or would violate any other
terms and conditions relating to use of the Web site. This FreeAdvice.com
Privacy statement is effective November 7, 1999.</font></p>
