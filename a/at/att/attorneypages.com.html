<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Privacy Statement for AttorneyPages.com</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AttorneyPages.com, recognized as 
  a leading national directory of attorneys and law firms, respects the privacy 
  of visitors to our site. AttorneyPages.com is a unit of Advice Company (Advice 
  &amp; Counsel Incorporated), a leading provider of information and advice and 
  E-commerce solutions on the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please read this Privacy Policy so 
  that you can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy. 
  Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below 
  by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We invite you to explore AttorneyPages.com 
  and its affiliated legal Websites, including the leading consumer law website 
  <a href="http://www.freeadvice.com/">www.FreeAdvice.com</a>, our the leading Online 
  expert witness and consultant’s directory <a href="http://www.expertpages.com/">www.ExpertPages.com</a> and also our affiliated 
  home improvement site <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/">www.DoItYourself.com</a>.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information this Site Gathers / 
  Tracks </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information gathered by Advice 
  Company falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors 
  to our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking 
  information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers 
  featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of products and 
  services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help make our sites more responsive 
  to the needs of our visitors, help you navigate between sections, tailor content 
  to your needs and to measure traffic within our sites, our web servers automatically 
  collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, 
  including your IP address, when you visit our sites. They also invoke a standard 
  feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor 
  a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides on your computer. 
  The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting 
  and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor 
  uses to access our site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless you voluntarily identify yourself 
  (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign 
  a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain 
  is information you supply. Our cookies can't read unrelated data from your computer. 
  Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through 
  our sites may also assign their own cookies to your browser, but we don't control 
  their cookies or their processes, and they do not regularly share information 
  they gather with us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make use of certain features on 
  certain of our websites (such as free email, personal web pages, bulletin boards 
  and other interactive forums) visitors need to register and to provide certain 
  information as part of the registration process. We may also ask for information 
  from those who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our 
  websites. We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, street address, 
  sex, age, city or town, zip code (and for those who seek to purchase a product 
  or service, credit card number), and we sometimes request information on your 
  interest in other topics. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information you supply may help 
  us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests 
  and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of 
  course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to 
  take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration. 
  The vast majority of our site does NOT require visitors to complete a registration 
  form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more we know about our visitors 
  the more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is 
  entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may 
  be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to 
  our sites. For example, while we allow anyone to read postings in the FreeAdvice.com 
  Bulletin Board / Forums without registration, asking a question or furnishing 
  an answer requires registration, which enables visitors to modify their own 
  posts. FreeAdvice.com’s one-on-one live chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! also 
  requires a separate registration. And we can't send you targeted email alerting 
  you to a relevant new service we're offering, or articles on topics of interest 
  to you, if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email 
  address. Similarly, we can't notify you that you've been lucky enough to win 
  a prize in a promotional contest if we don't know how to contact you. Such personal 
  information is gathered by us only with our users` knowing and active permission 
  and participation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our online surveys and contests ask 
  visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic 
  information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile 
  data collected at our site may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We collect financial information 
  (like an account or credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit 
  card or other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the 
  user for products and services and necessary information from the order form 
  to send orders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also use customer contact information 
  from the various registration forms, opt in features and service features to 
  send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users 
  may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section 
  below</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As this privacy policy reaffirms, 
  we strive to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right 
  to use customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate 
  to comply with applicable laws, rules, or lawful orders of courts and governmental 
  agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions for use of our 
  sites, or to protect third parties from what regard as threats of serious harm.

  in cooperation with Edgar Online, a bookstore in affiliation with Amazon, and 
  Legal Forms in conjunction with US Legal Forms. These firms share varying amounts 
  of information with us. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of 
  such providers before providing information to them.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Advertising and Cookies</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our sites display advertising and 
  we also work with several unaffiliated companies that serve ads when you visit 
  portions of our sites.&nbsp;Among the outside ad companies are Latitude 90, 
  DoubleClick’s Sonar Network, and Engage Media’s Flycast to display ads on our 
  sites.&nbsp;These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with such banner 
  or other ads are collected by our advertisers and/or ad companies, and we do 
  not have access to such information. These companies may use that information 
  (NOT including your name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit 
  card number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide 
  advertisements on this site and about other sites and goods and services that 
  they think may be of interest to you.</font></p>
