<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Privacy Statement for AttorneyPages.com</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AttorneyPages.com is the exclusive
  attorney directory associated with FreeAdvice.com, which is recognized as the
  Number 1 Legal Website for consumers and small businesses.&nbsp; We respect the privacy
  of visitors to our site. AttorneyPages and FreeAdvice.com are units of Advice
  Company (Advice &amp; Counsel Incorporated), a leading provider of information
  and advice and E-commerce solutions on the Internet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please read this Privacy Policy so
  that you can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy.
  Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below
  by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We invite you to explore <a href="http://www.attorneypages.com/">www.AttorneyPages.com</a> and its affiliated
  Websites, including <a href="http://www.freeadvice.com/">www.FreeAdvice.com</a>,
  <a href="http://www.expertpages.com/">www.ExpertPages.com</a> and <a href="http://www.doityourself.com/">www.DoItYourself.com</a>.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information this Site Gathers /
  Tracks </font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information gathered by Advice
  Company falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors
  to our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking
  information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers
  featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of products and
  services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To help make our sites more responsive
  to the needs of our visitors, help you navigate between sections, tailor content
  to your needs and to measure traffic within our sites, our web servers automatically
  collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet,
  including your IP address, when you visit our sites. They also invoke a standard
  feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor
  a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides on your computer.
  The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting
  and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor
  uses to access our site. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
  (through registration or sending a message, for example), we won't know who
  you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information
  a cookie can contain is information you supply. Our cookies can't read unrelated
  data from your computer. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide
  products or services through our sites may also assign their own cookies to
  your browser, but we don't control their cookies or their processes, and they
  do not regularly share information they gather with us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To make use of certain features on
  our websites (such as free email, personal web pages, our ask a lawyer live
  chat, bulletin boards and other interactive forums) visitors need to register
  and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may
  also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct
  other transactions on our websites. We may ask, for example, for your name,
  email address, street address, sex, age, city or town, zip code (and for those
  who seek to purchase a product or service, credit card number), and we sometimes
  request information on your interest in other topics.&nbsp; Those who choose to use
  our sites to transmit email messages to attorneys or experts also must provide
  certain identifying information, including name, city and state, email and phone
  number, so that the professional to whom the message is directed may reply to
  them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The information you supply may help
  us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests
  and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of
  course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to
  take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration.
  The vast majority of our sites do NOT require visitors to complete a registration
  form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit.
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more we know about our visitors
  the more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is
  entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may
  be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to
  our sites. For example, while we allow anyone to read postings in our Bulletin
  Board / Forums without registration, asking a question or furnishing an answer
  requires registration, which enables visitors to modify their own posts. Our
  one-on-one live chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! also requires a separate registration.
  And we can't send you targeted email alerting you to a relevant new service
  we're offering, or articles on topics of interest to you, if you don't tell
  us what you're interested in and give us your email address. Similarly, we can't
  notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a promotional contest
  if we don't know how to contact you. Such personal information is gathered by
  us only with our users` knowing and active permission and participation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our online surveys and contests ask
  visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic
  information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile
  data collected at our site may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We collect financial information
  (like an account or credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit
  card or other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the
  user for products and services and necessary information from the order form
  to send orders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also use customer contact information
  from the various registration forms, opt in features and service features to
  send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users
  may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section
  below</font></p>

  we strive to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right
  to use customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate

  agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions for use of our
