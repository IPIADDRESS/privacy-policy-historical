We understand that you may have questions about how this Website collects and uses information and we have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern the Website (the "Privacy Policy"). We will not sell or rent your Personal information or a list of our customers to third parties.

			<p><b>Legal Issues</b></p>

Laws related to Personal information vary by country. For example, personal information processed in the European Union is subject to the EU Directives and Regulations concerning personal data, privacy and electronic communications, including but not limited to The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.</p>

			<h2>B. COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>

			<p><b>Browsing</b></p>

			<p>This Website does not collect Personal information from your Device (as this term is defined below) when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with Personal information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or any other Personal information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other passive, technical, aggregated information. We collect such indirect and passive information through Technologies as further specified in Section Online Tracking Technologies in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on this Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs.</p>

			<p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>

			<p>As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal information as described above in Section Browsing above. In connection with other activities, such as subscribing to the services offered on the Website, subscribing to periodic newsletters sent by Alawar, requesting customer support, downloading trial versions of software, utilizing online software applications or purchasing any of the products and services available on the Website, Alawar may ask you to voluntarily supply us with certain Personal information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities and/or make any purchases. If you elect to engage in these activities or make purchases, however, Alawar may ask that you provide us Personal information, including but not limited to your first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, telephone number and photo. This information is requested in conjunction with the purchase of our products, registration of an account on the Website, contacting us for customer support. In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to our newsletter service.</p>

			<p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.</p>

			<p>Credit Card information is not retained by us as part of the registration process. This information is processed by our payment and billing providers during the purchase process and never disclosed to us except that we may receive from our payment and billing partners and process a part of your credit card number (the last 4 numbers) and information about your credit card issuer. We keep this data to make your future purchases at our Website simpler.</p>

			<p>You are provided an opportunity on the Alawar Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter. This newsletter is a marketing tool that allows Alawar to inform you of new products or services, as well as other news relevant to the company. The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address. Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent. You are given the opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.</p>

			<p>While the subscription list is maintained by a trusted third party affiliate, the list remains the sole exclusive property of Alawar. Your name and email address is not shared with any third party and will not be used to send you unsolicited communications. A link is provided to allow you to change your subscription preferences, including cancellation of your subscription.</p>

			<p>When processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their legitimate instructions and applicable laws.</p>

			<p>In addition, we may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Website and our products, so that we could take them into account while improving our Website and products.</p>

			<p>Alawar may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Alawar may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>

			<p>Alawar is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website. Alawar will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our Website.</p>

			<h2>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

			<p><b>How your Personal information is used</b></p>

			<p>Alawar acquire, hold, use and process Personal information based on the legal grounds, in order to fulfill contract with you and for the legitimate business purposes outlined herein and according to Article 6(1) of the GDPR. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your Personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special offers, features on our Website and other products and services of Alawar and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.</p>

			<p>Alawar uses the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the products or Website and end user license agreement violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of such cheating. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or end user license agreement violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.</p>

			<p>Alawar recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, Alawar will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Alawar or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Alawar will also not provide your Personal information to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>

			<p><b>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</b></p>

			<p>Alawar operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission.</p>

			<p>Alawar takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.</p>

			<p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After Personal information reaches Alawar it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Alawar. Because laws applicable to Personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Website covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and also in other countries where Alawar and its service providers conduct business. By providing information to Alawar you consent to the storage of your Personal information in these locations. All Alawar employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p>

			<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b></p>

			<p>Alawar does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants, web hosting, data management and storage service providers, marketing, advertising companies for delivery targeted advertisements, business partners providing services, products that you have requested or may be of interest to you that act as independent contractors on behalf of Alawar. These parties are contractually prohibited from processing Personal information for any purpose other than for performing legitimate contractual obligations or to comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

			<p>We do provide non-personal information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated, anonymized basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of Personal information to entities outside of the Alawar's affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>

			<p>Alawar may disclose your Personal information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Alawar may also disclose Personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of use, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.</p>

			<p>In the event that all or substantially all of Alawar's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Alawar may transfer Personal information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your Personal information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.</p>

			<p><b>Choices and Rights available to you</b></p>

			<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose Personal information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Alawar Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.</p>

			<p>You control which name, date of birth, email, photo, phone number we associate with your account. If they change, please modify the data in your personal account directly. Please inform us if any of the personal data we retain about you is inaccurate.</p>

			<p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Alawar or from having your Personal information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your Personal information with third parties or send you emails.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Use or applicable licensing agreements.</p>

			<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by Alawar of Personal information concerning you by deleting your account on the Website. If you request us to erasure your Personal information we will delete all Personal information about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the products, Website and end user license agreement violations. We will retain anonymous information after your account has been closed.</p>

			<p>Alawar is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.</p>

			<p>You may access and correct your Personal information and privacy preferences, opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any Personal information, by writing at <a href="mailto:privacy@alawar.com">privacy@alawar.com</a> or regular mail at Alawar Entertainment, Inc 901 N.

			<p>To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Alawar with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, date of birth and the email address you provided to Alawar when you requested services or products. Alawar reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.</p>

			<p>Where processing of your Personal information is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal information unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

			<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.</p>

			<h2>D. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</h2>

			<p>In your message, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the Alawar Online Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly.</p>

			<p>Please note that if you provide Alawar with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), Alawar cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.</p>
