      <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>

If, upon subscription to the Services, You have confirmed your assent to receive promotional and other commercial information by AllSeated, then AllSeated shall be entitled to use certain aspects of the Personal Information for promotional purposes, such as to offer You additional products or services.

      <p> AllSeated will disclose Your Information, as provided via the Website and/or Services, to third parties, without prior notice, only if: (a) AllSeated is required to do so by law, or if (b) AllSeated believes in good faith that such action is necessary to conform or comply with the provisions of any law or with legal proceedings, to protect the rights or property of AllSeated and/or to protect the personal safety of users of AllSeated or the public. </p>
      <p><strong>Use of Cookies </strong><br>
      The Website uses "Cookies" (whether of AllSeated or of third parties) to help you personalize Your online experience. A Cookie is a text file that is placed on Your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to Your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to You, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie to You. </p>
      <p>One of the primary purposes of Cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save You time. The purpose of a Cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if You updated details related to an Event, or register with the Website for different Events and/or Services therein, a Cookie helps AllSeated to recall Your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording Your personal information, such as IP addresses, username and so on. When you return to the Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so You can easily use the Website features that You customized. </p>
      <p>You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but You can usually modify Your browser setting to decline Cookies if You prefer. If You choose to decline Cookies, You may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Services provided in the Website or other web sites You visit. </p>
      <p><strong>Security of Personal
Information</strong><br>
AllSeated reasonably secures the Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, and keeps such information on computer servers in a standard controlled and secured environment. AllSeated's data bases on which Your data (and Personal Information therein) is reserved, are reasonably secured and programmed for protection from exposure and unauthorized use of such data and/or Personal Information. </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
      AllSeated may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, by placement of an updated Privacy Policy in the Website. AllSeated encourages You to periodically review this Privacy Policy from time to time, so to be informed of the subject matters hereof.</p>
      <p> <strong>Miscellaneous </strong><br>
      This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between You and AllSeated that arises in whole or in part from the Website and/or in connection with the use thereof, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of Delaware, USA. </p>
