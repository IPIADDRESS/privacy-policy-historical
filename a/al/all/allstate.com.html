      <p align="center"><a name="cookies"></a>Logging and Cookies 
      </p><p>During the period you are logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a 
        number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and 
        platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site 
        or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or 
        URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or 
        reviewing our site. 
      </p><p>As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent 
        to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer’s hard 
        drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever the browser 
        requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. 
        While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular 
        user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided 
        the site with such information or set up preferences in your browser to 
        do so automatically. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing 
        the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you 
        from using certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information 
        to take advantage of services or promotions. In general, cookies allow 
        us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more 
        customized service. We may also use cookies to track customer or user 
        requests, inquiries and traffic patterns or to determine audience size 
        and repeated usage.

        is not intended for children. We offer insurance and financial products 
        and services and thus do not market any products or services to children 
        under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children 
        under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has 
        been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, 
        we will delete this information.

        we may collect information from outside sources, such as loss information 
        reports, motor vehicle reports, and credit reports. For property insurance, 
        we may send someone to inspect your property and verify information about 
        the value and condition of your property. 
      </p><p>
      </p><p><b><a name="4"></a>How is this information used?</b></p>
      <p>The information you submit to us via our on-line forms and e-mail is 
        used to provide you with the response or service you have requested. It 
        may also be used with the information we collect via logging and cookies 
        to identify you as a particular user; to track and measure Web site usage 
        and customer/user preferences, interests, demographics, and traffic patterns; 
        and to determine audience size and repeated usage. This information may 
        also be used to manage and customize our Web site’s content, layout, and 
        services in order to improve our site, enhance customer service, and provide 
        tailored messages. 
      </p><p>We may also use this information to contact you about our products and

      </p><p><b><a name="5"></a>Who has access to this information?</b></p>
      <p>In order to better serve your particular needs, Allstate, its agencies, 
        and certain companies working on Allstate’s behalf have access to this 
        information. This information may also be disclosed to third parties without 
        your consent if disclosure is necessary to comply with legal processes 
        or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Allstate, its 
        users or the public. We may also provide limited information about you 
        to third parties without your permission when necessary or appropriate 
        to service an insurance policy we have issued (e.g., inquiries from lien 
        holders or additional insureds listed on the policy) or to address claims 
        submitted under a policy we have issued. 
      </p><p>When we share personal information with companies working on Allstate’s 
        behalf, we generally protect that personal information with a confidentiality 
        agreement. 
      </p><p>In addition, we may, as permitted by law, provide information about you 
        without your permission to certain persons or organizations, such as: 
        your agent or broker; insurance support organizations; other insurance 
        companies in order to perform their function in regard to an insurance 
        transaction involving you; independent claim adjusters; businesses that 
        conduct actuarial or research studies; regulatory and law enforcement 
        authorities; or our affiliated companies. We may also disclose statistical 
        information about the use of our Web site. 
      </p><p>We may also give information about you, such as your name and address, 
        to persons or organizations that may wish to provide you with information

        may include affiliates of Allstate. If you do not want us to give information

      </p><p><b><a name="7"></a>What are your options regarding correction or storage 
        of your information?</b></p>
      <p>You may either personally see, or obtain from us by mail, the information

        in our records or files is incomplete or inaccurate, you may request via 
        <a href="http://echomail.allstate.com/em_dir/allstate/mail.nsf/Email+Form?OpenForm">

      </p><p><b><a name="8"></a>What security procedures do we use to guard against 
        the loss, misuse, alteration, or theft of your information?</b></p>
      <p>We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, a secure server and security 
        protocol to safeguard the information you submit. 
      </p><p>To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information 
        that you submit to us (other than via an e-mail message), we use security 
        software to encrypt the information before and during its transmission 
        through the Internet. We only allow information to be submitted for transmission 
        if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser 
        is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction 
        cannot be completed because of the security risk. 
      </p><p>E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt 
        e-mail messages. E-mail messages traveling through the Internet are subject 
        to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet. 
      </p><p>We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, 
        please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission 
        of any personal or financial information. Please keep in mind that transmitting 
        information via the Internet is never completely secure and thus any information 
        submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or disclosed by others. 
        We encourage customers to either send confidential correspondence through 
        the postal service or use the telephone to speak directly to our employees. 
        We are not responsible for the security of confidentiality of communications 
        you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages. 
      </p><p>
      </p><p><b><a name="9"></a>What can you do as a customer to help maintain security?</b></p>
      <p>Utilize the latest version of Netscape and/or Microsoft Explorer. Our 
        site is most secure when using one of these browsers. 
      </p><p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>Keep your User ID and PIN confidential. Utilize a PIN unique to you 
          and change it frequently.</li>
        <li>Make sure others are not watching you enter your User ID and/or PIN 
          on your keyboard when using the Customer Care Center or when using other 
          protected areas of allstate.com.</li>
        <li>Do not leave your computer unattended while logged onto our Customer 
          Care Center or other protected areas of allstate.com. After you’ve finished 
          accessing your information, exit the Customer Care Center or other protected 
          area within allstate.com. This ensures that no one can access your policy 
          information if you leave your computer and your session has not been 
          timed out.</li>
