We hope that this notice, which describes our use and protection of nonpublic personal information (“customer information”), will help you understand how we treat the customer information that we obtain from you or other sources in the course of providing you with products and services. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">Whether you’re doing business with us through your local agent or broker, our Customer Information Center, or allstate.com, we want you to know that Allstate respects your privacy and protects your information. </font></p><ul><li><font class="copytext">We do not sell your customer information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li><li><font class="copytext">We do not share customer information with persons, companies, or organizations outside of Allstate that would use that information to contact you about their own products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li><li><font class="copytext">We expect persons or organizations that provide services on our behalf to keep customer information confidential and to use it only to provide the services we’ve asked them to perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li><li><font class="copytext">Within Allstate, we communicate regarding the need to protect your information to those individuals who may have access to it, and we’ve established physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information.</font></li></ul><p><font class="copytext">Attention Internet users . . . This Privacy Statement also provides important information relating to your use of our Web site, including, for example, information regarding: 1) logging and our use of online data collecting devices known as “cookies;” 2) our collection of information such as IP address (the number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data, and your activity while using our site; 3) who should use our web site; 4) the security of information transmitted over the Internet; and 5) links and co-branded sites.</font></p><p><font class="copytext">Below we’ve provided answers to questions that might be on your mind regarding privacy. You may be wondering …&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>What do we do with your customer information?&nbsp; </strong><br>Allstate does not sell your customer information, or medical information, to anyone. Nor do we share it with companies or organizations outside of Allstate that would use that information to contact you about their own products and services. If that practice were ever to change, we would, of course, offer you the ability to opt out of this type of information sharing, and we would offer you the opt out with time for you to respond before the change in our practice takes place. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">To help you with your overall insurance program, your agent or broker may use customer information for marketing purposes. We may also use customer information to communicate with you about products, features, and options you have expressed an interest in or that we believe may be of interest to you. <br>We may, without authorization but only as permitted or required by law, provide customer information to persons or organizations both inside and outside of Allstate in order to fulfill a transaction you have requested, service your policy, or market our products to you, investigate and/or handle claims, detect and/or prevent fraud, participate in insurance support organizations, or comply with lawful requests from regulatory and law enforcement authorities. These include, for example: our affiliated companies, companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, other financial institutions with which we have a joint marketing agreement for the sale of our own products, and your agent or broker.&nbsp; </font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>What kind of customer information do we have, and where did we get it?<br></strong>Much of the customer information that we collect comes directly from you. When submitting your application or request for insurance or other products and services we offer, or in requesting an insurance quote, you may give us information such as your name, address, and Social Security number. We also keep information about your transactions with our affiliates, others, or us - for example, the types of products and services you purchase from us, premiums, account balances and payment history.&nbsp; We may also collect information from our Web site such as your activity while using our site and information from online collecting devices known as “cookies” (see below). </font></p><p><font class="copytext">We also may collect information from outside sources, including consumer reporting agencies and health care providers. This information includes loss information reports, motor vehicle reports, credit reports, and medical information.</font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>How do we protect your customer information?</strong><br>When we share customer information with companies working on Allstate’s behalf, we expect those companies to use that information only to provide the service we have asked them to perform. Within Allstate, customer information is available to those individuals who may need to see it to fulfill and service the needs of Allstate customers. We communicate regarding the need to protect customer information to all employees and agents, especially those individuals who have access to it. Plus, we’ve established physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information.</font></p><p><font class="copytext">Finally, should your relationship with Allstate end, your customer information will remain protected in accordance with our privacy practices as outlined in this Important Notice.</font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>How can you find out what information we have about you?</strong><br>You may request to either see, or obtain from us by mail, the customer information about you in our records. If you believe that information is incomplete or inaccurate, you may request that we make any necessary corrections, additions or deletions to the disputed customer information. To fulfill your request, we may make arrangements with an insurance support organization or a consumer reporting agency to copy and disclose customer information to you on our behalf.&nbsp; You may also request a more complete description of the entities to whom we disclose customer information, or the circumstances which might warrant such disclosures. Please send any of the requests listed above in writing to: Allstate Insurance Company, Customer Privacy Inquiries, P.O. Box 11904, Roanoke, VA 24022. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">_____________________________</font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>If you are an Internet user…</strong><br>Allstate.com provides information about Allstate, our products, and the agencies and brokers that represent us. You may also perform certain transactions on the Web site.&nbsp; This Privacy Statement applies to users of Allstate.com, regardless of whether the user is an Allstate customer.&nbsp; In addition, as an Internet user, you should be aware of the following . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>What are cookies and how are they used?&nbsp; <br>Do you log my activity on your site?<br>Will I receive promotional e-mails from Allstate?<br></strong>During the period you are logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or reviewing our site. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer’s hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided us with such information (over the Internet or otherwise) or set up preferences in your browser to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address or other personal information. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">In general, cookies allow us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more customized service. We may also use cookies to track and measure customer or user requests, inquiries, preferences, interests, demographics, traffic patterns and Web site usage, and to determine audience size and repeated usage.&nbsp; This information may also be used to manage and customize our Web site’s content, layout, and services in order to improve our site, enhance customer service, and provide tailored messages.</font></p><p><font class="copytext">As indicated above, we may also use customer information to send you promotional communications about products, features, and options that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If we have your e-mail address, we may do this by e-mail.&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, you can inform us of your desire to be removed from our mailing lists by writing us at Allstate Insurance Company, Customer Privacy Inquiries, P.O. Box 11904, Roanoke, VA 24022.&nbsp; </font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>Who Should Use Our Web Site?<br></strong>Our Web site is for insurance and financial products and services and is not intended for children. We offer insurance and financial products and services and thus do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information. </font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>What security procedures do we use to guard against the loss, misuse, alteration, or theft of information while that information is being submitted to Allstate over the Internet?<br></strong>We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, secure servers and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information that you submit to us (other than via an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information before and during its transmission through the Internet. We only allow information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can be completed but at a lower level of security.</font></p><p><font class="copytext">E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt e-mail messages. E-mail messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet. </font></p><p><font class="copytext">We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission of any personal or financial information via e-mail. Please keep in mind that transmitting information via e-mail over the Internet is never completely secure and thus any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or disclosed by others. If you are concerned about the security of your communication, we encourage you to send your correspondence through the postal service or use the telephone to speak directly to us.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages.</font></p><p><font class="copytext"><strong>What can you do as a customer to help maintain the security of information when accessing Allstate over the Internet?</strong><br>Some steps you can take to maintain the security of your information include:</font></p><ul><li><font class="copytext">Utilize the latest, generally proven version of the Netscape, Microsoft Explorer or the America Online browser. Our site is most secure when using one of these browsers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li><li><font class="copytext">Keep your User ID and PIN or password confidential.
