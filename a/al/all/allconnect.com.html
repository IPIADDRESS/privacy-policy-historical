	<p><a name="a" id="a"></a><b>What Are The Important Terms Used
	Throughout This Privacy Policy?</b></p>
	<p>Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. 
	"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us 
	specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, 
	email address, billing address, social security number, and credit 
	card number. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable 
	Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy 
	policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. 
	We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various 
	persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not 
	identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person 
	or entity with such information.</p>

	<p><a name="b" id="b"></a><b>What Types Of Information Do We
	Collect, How Do We Use it and To Whom Do We Disclose It?</b></p>

	<p>Visiting Our Site. When you visit our Web Site to browse, we may 
	collect and store the domain name and host from which you access the 
	Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser 
	software and operating system and your entity identification. We may 
	use this information to organize and analyze IP addresses so that we 
	can provide items such as efficient service, enhance security, monitor 
	appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of 
	non-Personally Identifiable information may be shared with third parties, 
	such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for 
	marketing and commercial purposes. When you visit our Web Site, you may 
	also choose certain options such as (i) Your Account, (ii) About 
	Allconnect ®, (iii) Bundles, Phone, TV, Internet, Utilities and Home 
	Service, (iv) Customer Service and (v) Contact Us to obtain more 
	information about us, our business associates and our Services. Through 
	these options, you may provide us with Personally Identifiable 
	Information. We will collect, use and disclose such Personally 
	Identifiable Information as further described below in Using Our Services.</p>

	<p>Using Our Services. When you use our Services, you must through our 
	initial registration process or subsequent order placements provide 
	Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, address, e-mail 
	address, and billing information for you to properly and fully receive 
	the offered Services. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable 
	Information and any modifications that either we or you make to that information, 
	except that we do not permanently retain your social security number, credit 
	card number or other payment information needed solely for the processing of your 
	order. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally 
	Identifiable Information to any third party without the consent of the provider of 
	such information, except that we may share User Information with our business 
	associates who assist us in administering the Services. In such cases, the business 
	associates are permitted to use this information only in order to carry out the 
	services Allconnect ® has contracted for. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or 
	transfer certain User Information (i) to provide you the Services or information 
	you request; (ii) to send you additional information about your ordered services 
	such as a confirmation, reminder, problem status or change order; (iii) to send you 
	a newsletter or other marketing materials; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or 
	security of your records; (v) to comply with government requests if appropriate for 
	your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible 
	unlawful activity; (vi) in connection with a sale or merger of Allconnect ®, or (vii) 
	for other legally permissible purposes. We may also share aggregate anonymized data 
	relating to the transactions on the site and use of the Services for marketing, 
	research and other purposes.</p>

	<p>From time to time, we may send you survey forms or include survey forms on our 
	site asking you for information regarding your use of our Services. For the most 
	part, we will only disclose your survey responses that contain anonymized data to 
	our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. However, we 
	may share email addresses with business associates who assist us in administering 
	the Services.</p>

	coupon or purchase products and services from a third party through our Web Site. 
	For example, when you sign up to initiate service to your home by a utility or other 
	service provider under Your Account, Allconnect ® passes the Personally Identifiable 
	Information needed for that service on to the third party utility or service provider. 
	Please pay close attention when you obtain a coupon or are purchasing products and 
	services from a third party because different rules may apply to those parties' use or 
	disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us.

	by us and not third parties from whom you may obtain a coupon or purchase products and 
	services.</p>

	in accordance with their own privacy policy, and you may begin receiving emails from such 
	third party. We have no responsibility or liability for the independent actions or policies 
	of these independent sites, and are not responsible for the content, terms or privacy 
	practices of such sites. In order to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you 
	may wish to first review the privacy policies of any third party from whom you obtain 
	coupons, products or services on our Web Site, or before providing any information on a 
	third party web site.</p>

	communications from such third parties.</p>
	
	<p><a name="f" id="f"></a><b>How Do We Protect Your Information?</b></p>
	<p>We employ and maintain technology and security measures designed to protect User 
	Information. When you submit sensitive information via our site, that information is subject 
	to a variety of protections both on-line and off-line, including password-protected systems, 
	firewalls and secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption technology. On a periodic basis, we also 
	perform security audits of our data center to help ensure a more secure site. However, no data 
	transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. As a result, while we strive 
	to protect your User Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
	you transmit to us or receive from us.</p>

	<p><a name="g" id="g"></a><b>How Do You Safeguard Your Passwords?</b></p>
	<p>When you initially register for our Services, you will choose a member ID and a password. 
	To subsequently sign-in as a member, you will need to enter your correct member ID and password. 
	We designed this password-protected system to help safeguard your User Information. To help us 
	further protect your User Information, we ask that you not, lend, give, or otherwise disclose 
	any member ID or passwords to any unauthorized person, or permit any unauthorized person to use 
	your accounts or related member ID or passwords except as specifically permitted by this privacy 
	policy or other instructions regarding the Services. Moreover, we will never ask for your member 
	ID or password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.</p>

	<p><a name="h" id="h"></a><b>What If You Lose Your Password or It Becomes Compromised?</b></p>
	<p>If your member ID or password has been compromised for any reason, then you should immediately 
	notify us so that we may issue you a new member ID or password. Any loss of control of your member 
	ID or password may result in the loss of control over Personally Identifiable Information. If you 
	fail to protect your member ID or password, then you will be responsible for any actions taken on 
	your behalf or by any person using your member ID or password.</p>
	
	<p><a name="i" id="i"></a><b>Can Children Use the Web Site?</b></p>
	<p>The Web Site is intended for use by adults, and we ask that children 
	under the age of 13 do not use the Web Site and do not submit any 
	Personally Identifiable Information to us. </p>
	
	<p><a name="j" id="j"></a><b>How Will You Know of Changes to this Privacy Policy?</b></p>
	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
	to this privacy policy, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so 
	that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
	circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

	<p><a name="a" id="a"></a><b>What Are The Important Terms Used
	Throughout This Privacy Policy?</b></p>
	<p>Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. 
	"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us 
	specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, 
	email address, billing address, social security number, and credit 
	card number. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable 
	Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy 
	policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. 
	We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various 
	persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not 
	identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person 
	or entity with such information.</p>

	<p><a name="b" id="b"></a><b>What Types Of Information Do We
	Collect, How Do We Use it and To Whom Do We Disclose It?</b></p>

	<p>Visiting Our Site. When you visit our Web Site to browse, we may 
	collect and store the domain name and host from which you access the 
	Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser 
	software and operating system and your entity identification. We may 
	use this information to organize and analyze IP addresses so that we 
	can provide items such as efficient service, enhance security, monitor 
	appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of 
	non-Personally Identifiable information may be shared with third parties, 
	such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for 
	marketing and commercial purposes. When you visit our Web Site, you may 
	also choose certain options such as (i) Your Account, (ii) About 
	Allconnect, (iii) Bundles, Phone, TV, Internet, Utilities and Home 
	Service, (iv) Customer Service and (v) Contact Us to obtain more 
	information about us, our business associates and our Services. Through 
	these options, you may provide us with Personally Identifiable 
	Information. We will collect, use and disclose such Personally 
	Identifiable Information as further described below in Using Our Services.</p>

	<p>Using Our Services. When you use our Services, you must through our 
	initial registration process or subsequent order placements provide 
	Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, address, e-mail 
	address, and billing information for you to properly and fully receive 
	the offered Services. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable 
	Information and any modifications that either we or you make to that information, 
	except that we do not permanently retain your social security number, credit 
	card number or other payment information needed solely for the processing of your 
	order. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally 
	Identifiable Information to any third party without the consent of the provider of 
	such information, except that we may share User Information with our business 
	associates who assist us in administering the Services. In such cases, the business 
	associates are permitted to use this information only in order to carry out the 
	services Allconnect has contracted for. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or 
	transfer certain User Information (i) to provide you the Services or information 
	you request; (ii) to send you additional information about your ordered services 
	such as a confirmation, reminder, problem status or change order; (iii) to send you 
	a newsletter or other marketing materials; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or 
	security of your records; (v) to comply with government requests if appropriate for 
	your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible 
	unlawful activity; (vi) in connection with a sale or merger of Allconnect, or (vii) 
	for other legally permissible purposes. We may also share aggregate anonymized data 
	relating to the transactions on the site and use of the Services for marketing, 
	research and other purposes.</p>

	<p>From time to time, we may send you survey forms or include survey forms on our 
	site asking you for information regarding your use of our Services. For the most 
	part, we will only disclose your survey responses that contain anonymized data to 
	our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. However, we 
	may share email addresses with business associates who assist us in administering 
	the Services.</p>

	coupon or purchase products and services from a third party through our Web Site. 
	For example, when you sign up to initiate service to your home by a utility or other 
	service provider under Your Account, Allconnect passes the Personally Identifiable 
	Information needed for that service on to the third party utility or service provider. 
	Please pay close attention when you obtain a coupon or are purchasing products and 
	services from a third party because different rules may apply to those parties' use or 
	disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us.

	services.</p>

	of these independent sites, and are not responsible for the content, terms or privacy

	<p><a name="f" id="f"></a><b>How Do We Protect Your Information?</b></p>
	<p>We employ and maintain technology and security measures designed to protect User 
	Information. When you submit sensitive information via our site, that information is subject 
	to a variety of protections both on-line and off-line, including password-protected systems, 
	firewalls and secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption technology. On a periodic basis, we also 
	perform security audits of our data center to help ensure a more secure site. However, no data 
	transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. As a result, while we strive 
	to protect your User Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
	you transmit to us or receive from us.</p>

	<p><a name="g" id="g"></a><b>How Do You Safeguard Your Passwords?</b></p>
	<p>When you initially register for our Services, you will choose a member ID and a password. 
	To subsequently sign-in as a member, you will need to enter your correct member ID and password. 
	We designed this password-protected system to help safeguard your User Information. To help us 
	further protect your User Information, we ask that you not, lend, give, or otherwise disclose 
	any member ID or passwords to any unauthorized person, or permit any unauthorized person to use 
	your accounts or related member ID or passwords except as specifically permitted by this privacy 
	policy or other instructions regarding the Services. Moreover, we will never ask for your member 
	ID or password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.</p>

	<p><a name="h" id="h"></a><b>What If You Lose Your Password or It Becomes Compromised?</b></p>
	<p>If your member ID or password has been compromised for any reason, then you should immediately 
	notify us so that we may issue you a new member ID or password. Any loss of control of your member 
	ID or password may result in the loss of control over Personally Identifiable Information. If you 
	fail to protect your member ID or password, then you will be responsible for any actions taken on 
	your behalf or by any person using your member ID or password.</p>

	that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
	circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
