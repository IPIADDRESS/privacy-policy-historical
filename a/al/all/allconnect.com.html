  <p><a name="a" id="a"></a><b>What Are The Important Terms UsedThroughout This Privacy Policy?</b></p>
  <p>Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms.

"User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.</p>
