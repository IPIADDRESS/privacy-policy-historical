		<p>All Day Giveaways/AllDayGiveaways.com (“we,” “us,” “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on this site ("Site") and how such information may be used and/or shared with others.</p>
		<p>YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE USE IT. This Site collects the following kinds of information: (1)
information that personally identifies you (such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address); (2) information that identifies your interests for “giveaway matching” including past
giveaway participation history (3) information that does not personally identify you (such as the
number of users who log on to the Site on a daily basis); As a general policy, no personally identifiable
information is automatically collected from your visit to this Site. AllDayGiveaways.com only collects
and retains personal information that you provide to us voluntarily in exchange for participation in
giveaways. In certain circumstances, you may be asked on a voluntary basis to provide us with some
personally identifiable information about yourself in order to use specific features on the Site, such as
giveaways, offers, contests, surveys and other promotions. Such information may include contact
information, and other information as we may require. The personally identifiable information you
submit will be used to carry out your requests and respond to your inquiries. To accomplish this, we
may share your personally identifiable information with third parties such as giveaway publishers or
those that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or
individuals that deliver merchandise, participate in our promotions, publish giveaways, administer our
promotions, provide marketing or promotional assistance, analyze data or provide customer service.
In that case, such information will be shared only to the extent they need such information to perform
their functions. Your personally identifiable information may also be used by us or shared with our
publishers and affiliates to provide you with product information, and promotional and other offers.
We may also use your information as otherwise disclosed at the point where such information is
collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature of the Site.
Except as provided herein, your personally identifiable information will not be supplied to any third
parties without prior approval from you. Participation in any available giveaway consents approval. As
a condition for free ballots in any giveaway on the site, your information will be provided to our
publisher giveaways for use in marketing messages. Your information will remain on the site and
cannot be exported by the publisher. At any date after receiving a marketing message from a giveaway
publisher, you can “unsubscribe” from that particular publisher and all mailings will cease. From time
to time, we may collect non-personally identifiable information from you through the standard
operation of our servers. Such information can include the type of browser being used, the operating
system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and the number of users
that visit a specific page on the Site and the character and duration of such visits. This information may
be used to help analyze site traffic and improve our services. We may also aggregate such information
to create statistical data and share it with potential advertisers, partners, affiliates and other third
parties. At no point, however, will the aggregated information personally identify you.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-
personally identifiable information if we are required to do so or if we reasonably believe that such
action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of
the law; (c) comply with legal process served on us; (d) protect or defend the legal rights or property of
All Day Giveaways, its parent company Flip Pocket and its affiliates, this Site, or its users; or (e) in an
emergency to protect the welfare of our users or the general public. We may also transfer personally
identifiable information to another entity in the event of certain corporate transactions, such as a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or corporate division or other fundamental corporate change.</p>
		<p>CHILDREN UNDER 13 This Site is operated in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act and is not intended to collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of
13. Children under the age of 13 should not provide any personally identifiable information on the
Site without the knowledge and permission of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian of a child
who has provided us with such information would like the information deleted from our records, he
or she should contact us at the e-mail address or phone number listed at the bottom of this policy
statement. We will make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our existing files.

IP ADDRESS An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
surf the Web. Web servers, the big computers that “serve up” Web pages, automatically identify your
computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, reporting
aggregate information to our advertisers, and to track Site usage. When visitors request pages from
the Site, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything
personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains
anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor only when we
feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's policies or to protect our service, customers,
the Site, or others.</p>
		<p>COOKIES “Cookies” are small text files from a Web site that are stored on your hard drive. These
small text files make using a Web site more convenient by saving your passwords and preferences
for you. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. We may analyze
the information derived from these cookies and match such information with data provided by you
or another party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personally identifiable information to
potential partners, advertisers, publisher s(who may use this information to provide advertisements
tailored to your interests) or other third parties, but we will not disclose any personally identifiable
information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. Also, we may allow third parties that serve
advertisements on our Site (including our promotion partners) to place and access cookies on your
computer, but they will not be able to access our cookies. The use of cookies by such third parties
is not subject to our Privacy Policy, but is subject to their own respective privacy policies. You can
have the option of deciding whether or not to accept a cookie by resetting your browser to notify
you whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from
your hard drive. Please note, however, that some parts of this Site will not function properly or will be
considerably slower if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable your cookies settings.</p>
		<p>KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in
place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please
be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information and
privacy, information is provided at your own risk; we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any
information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction,
or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.</p>

responsible for the privacy practices employed by these third party web sites. We encourage you
to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements of such other web sites before
submitting any personally identifiable information.</p>

wish to review/amend any personally identifiable information you have provided or wish to opt-out
of any further promotional efforts or sharing of information, you can contact us at: All Day Giveaways
