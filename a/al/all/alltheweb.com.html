<p>Fast Search &amp; Transfer ASA ("FAST") is committed to protecting your privacy.  AlltheWeb is a general audience web site, intended for users of all ages. Personal information of all users is collected, used and disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>All products and services on AlltheWeb.com are made available subject to this Privacy Policy. By using our Products and Services, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy as it may change from time to time. Required legal notices regarding our privacy practices will be accessible through the posting of a clear and conspicuous link to the current version of this Privacy Policy on Alltheweb.com near the bottom of most pages.</p>

<p>You also have the right to demand access to information about the processing of any personal data about you by AlltheWeb and the nature of the personal data. For the avoidance of doubt, personal data in this context means any information gathered about you as you interact with AlltheWeb, and not personal information that may be included in our search engine as it finds such data on the Internet. This demand should be addressed to the AlltheWeb General Manager, Fast Search &amp; Transfer, 93 Worcester Street, Wellesley, MA 02481, USA. The general manager, at his own initiative, shall rectify deficient personal data if he becomes aware of any such deficiencies.</p>

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

<p>AlltheWeb does not collect any unique information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.  Whenever you visit AlltheWeb, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, time of day, browser type, browser language, and any search terms you query.  AlltheWeb uses this anonymous information to customize your experience and to improve our services in general. For example, AlltheWeb may use your IP address to determine what your default search languages are.</p>

<h2>Does AlltheWeb use cookies?</h2>

<p>AlltheWeb uses "cookies" to help personalize your experience.  A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you and/or your computer as a unique user.  AlltheWeb will not disclose its cookies to any third party unless required by law.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  Be aware, however, that some parts of AlltheWeb may not function properly if you decline cookies
</p>

<h2>With whom does AlltheWeb share the collected information?</h2>

<p>In those instances where AlltheWeb collects personally identifiable information, we do NOT disclose this information to any third party unless we have your prior consent or we are compelled to do so in order to comply with the law.</p>

<p>AlltheWeb may however share aggregate information about our users and search trends with advertisers, business partners, and other third parties.</p>

<p>FAST may transfer any information in its possession in connection with a
sale of assets of the company, a sale of the company or a merger.</p>

<h2>What if the privacy policy changes?</h2>

<p>AlltheWeb may change this privacy policy from time to time.  All changes will be posted on this page so that you will always be aware of what information we collect and to whom we disclose such information.</p>

<h2>What if I have questions or comments about this privacy policy?</h2>

<p>You can direct all additional questions and comments regarding our privacy policy through our <a href="/info/contact/index.html">feedback center</a>.</p>
