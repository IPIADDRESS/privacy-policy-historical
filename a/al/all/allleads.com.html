		<p class="privecytext">AllLeads, a California corporation (hereafter “AllLeads”) is dedicated to establishing a trusting relationships with its registered users, based on respect for personal identity and information, by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy policy (“Policy”) covers the www.AllLeads.com website (hereafter the “Site). Because AllLeads wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, we are disclosing:</p>
		<p class="privecy_text">1. What personally identifiable information AllLeads collects.<br>
       2. How AllLeads uses the information.<br>
       3. With whom AllLeads may share user information.
       <br>
       4. What choices are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.<br>
       5. What types of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under AllLeads control.<br>
       6. How users can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>
		<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact AllLeads Customer Support by email <br>
		  at support@AllLeads.com.</p>
		 <p class="privecy_text2">Information Collection and Use</p> 
		  <p class="privecy_text3">Information Collection</p>
		  
		<p>AllLeads is the sole owner of the information collected on the Site. AllLeads collects information from its users at several different points on<br> 
		  our Site.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Registration</p>
		<p>In order to use AllLeads services which are a pre-pay service, a user must first complete the registration process. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email address, telephone number, home address, etc), a unique identifier, and financial information (such as credit card information, billing address, etc.). We use this information to contact the user about services on our Site for which the user has expressed interest and to provide those services and bill user for the services.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Profile</p>
		<p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Site, and to potentially direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share personally identifiable elements of your profile with other third parties. Your profile is shared in aggregate form only.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Cookies</p>
		<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>
		<p>    By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user might be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section, above.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Log Files</p>
		<p>    Like most Web sites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Clear Gifs</p>
		<p>    Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.
    We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Communications from the Site</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3"> Special Offers and Updates</p>
		<p>    We send all new registered users a welcoming email to verify a new user’s contact information and PIN or password. Existing registered users will occasionally receive emails containing information about us, service related announcements, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our members, and member satisfaction questions.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Service Announcements</p>
		<p>    On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.;</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Customer Service</p>
		<p>    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and regarding issues relating to their accounts. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3"> Sharing</p>
		<p> Legal Disclaimer
    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding or administrative hearing, or other legal process served on our Site. For example, AllLeads may disclose personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or third parties in response to criminal or civil subpoenas. If we do receive a request to disclose a registered user’s personal information, we will notify user of such request at the email or telephone number recorded in our database at that time. Users are advised to keep current their contact information on file with us and update it accordingly.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3"> Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</p>
		<p> We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Third Party Intermediaries</p>
		<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for services. These companies have contracted with us not to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3"> Business Transitions</p>
		<p>In the event AllLeads goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given a choice not to have their information used in this different manner, as described in the notification of changes section, below.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Choice/Opt-out</p>
		<p> Registered users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' from having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our registration forms will have an 'opt-in' mechanism if we implement a program asking you for consent to receive promotions according to your particular interests. Users must proactively choose to receive these promotions.
    Users of our Site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users may make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>
		<p class="privecy_text3">Links</p>
		<p> This Site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that AllLeads is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Statement applies solely to information collected by this Site. AllLeads may enter into advertising and affiliate relationships with third party web sites which drive interested parties to our Site. Information that is collected on these third party sites are not controlled by this Policy, and users are advised to read the separate privacy policies of these web sites.</p></td>
