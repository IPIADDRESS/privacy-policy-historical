    <h3>About the Allrecipes.com Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
    At Allrecipes.com, Inc. (“Allrecipes.com“), we recognize the importance of your privacy. That said, 
it’s understandable that you may be concerned with the information you provide to us or that is collected by 
us and how we use and disclose it. With these concerns in mind, we’ve developed the Allrecipes.com Privacy 
Policy, outlined below. This Privacy Policy explains Allrecipes.com’s privacy practices for visitors to our 
Web site at <a id="ctl00_CenterColumnPlaceHolder_Hyperlink30" href="http://allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a> 
(the “Website”). By using our Website, you consent to the collection, use and 
disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this 
Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a new policy on the 
Website and update the “last updated” date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our 
Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Website to see if it has been updated since your last visit. If you have any 
questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at

    <h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong>  Personal information is information that specifically identifies an 
    individual, such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other 
    account number, and information about that individual’s activities when directly linked to that person 
    such as information about his or her purchases.  Personal information also includes demographic information, 
    such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences, when such information is linked to other 
    personal information that identifies the individual.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Aggregate Information:</strong>  Personal information does not include “aggregate” 
    information.  Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or 
    customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.  In other words, information about how 
    you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no 
    personal information will be included in the resulting data.  Likewise, information about the products you 
    purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others.  Aggregate data 
    helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and 
    tailor existing products and services to customer desires.  We may share aggregate information about our users 
    with third parties for various purposes, such as helping us better understand and improve our services, and for 
    advertising and marketing purposes.</li>

    <h3>How We Collect and Use Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
    Allrecipes.com collects personal information from you at several different points on our Website, as set forth 
    below.  In general, we use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected (such as to provide 
    services or complete transactions you have requested, for billing purposes, and to anticipate and resolve 
    problems with our Website and our products and services), for our own internal business operations, to respond 
    to customer support inquiries and for other purposes as described below.

    <h3>Registration, Purchases; Other Information Submissions</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>When you register to become a member on our Website, you are asked to create a unique login and password, 
    and are required to give certain personal information (such as your name, email address, and zip code).  We may 
    also request certain information about your tastes and preferences (such as your favorite food, purchases or 
    recipes).</li>
    <li>Information you provide during registration may be used for some or all of the following:</li>
    
        <ul>
        <li>to provide services you have requested, or to otherwise fulfill your request; and</li>
        <li>to contact you from time to time (i) about services on our Website for which you have expressed 
        interest; (ii) with news, (iii) for internal marketing, informational, and promotional purposes; or (iv) for 
        any other lawful purpose related to your use of the Website.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <li>Additionally, your registration information may be used, together with other information you submit to us in 
    conjunction with your use of the Website, for the following purposes:</li>

        <ul>
        <li>for editorial purposes, such as when you submit a recipe to us (e.g., to attribute your submitted recipe 
        to you);</li>
        <li>to contact you for any reason regarding content you have submitted to the Website (e.g., to ask you a 
        question about a recipe you have submitted); and</li>
        <li>to identify you by name when posting content you submit to us on the Website (e.g., when you request a 
        recipe on the Website, to post your name and a description of the recipe you are requesting).</li>
        </ul>

    <li>If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to view offers for goods and services that are 
    available from selected third party companies (“Co-Registration Vendors”), we will make certain 
    contact and demographic information you provide during registration (e.g., name, age, and/or email address) 
    available to these vendors.  If you request goods or services from a Co-Registration Vendor, you may be asked to 
    submit additional demographic and other personal information.  The Co-Registration Vendor may use your 
    registration information which we provide to it, along with any information you submit directly to it, to 
    fulfill, or secure fulfillment of, your request.  For additional information about disclosure of your personal 
    information to our Co-Registration Vendors, and their use thereafter, please see the “Disclosure of 
    Personal Information” section below.</li>
    <li>We collect personal information such as your credit card, credit card billing address, and related billing 
    information if you purchase products or services on our Website.  We use this information to fulfill your orders 
    and bill you for them.</li>

    <h3>Newsletters</h3>
    <p>
    When you submit your email address to us to initiate a subscription to one of our newsletters, we ask for 
    personal information such as your name and email address.  This personal information is only used to send you 
    the newsletter(s) you have requested.  You may opt-out of such follow-up contacts by following the instructions 
    in the newsletter.  Please also note that we use a “double opt-in” process to confirm your 
    subscription to our newsletters.  When you initiate a subscription to one of our email newsletters, we send a 
    confirmation email message to the email address.  We only subscribe your email address to the newsletter after 
    you follow the steps in the confirmation email message.

    <h3>E-mail-A-Friend</h3>
    <p>
    When you elect to use our referral service for emailing a recipe or other content to a friend, we ask you for 
    your friend’s name and email address.  Allrecipes.com will automatically send your friend a one-time email 
    on your behalf which contains the recipe or other content, and which invites your friend to visit the Website.  
    Allrecipes.com uses your friend’s name and email address only to send this one-time email, and does not 
    store this information.  If your friend does not wish to receive “email-a-friend” messages to be 
    sent on your behalf, he or she must contact you directly.  Allrecipes.com users may not use our referral service 
    to send unwanted spam to others.

    <h3>Contests, Promotions, Offers and Surveys</h3>
    <p>
    From time to time our Website requests personal information from users via contests, promotions, offers and 
    surveys.  Participation in these contests, promotions, offers, and surveys is completely voluntary and you 
    therefore may choose whether to disclose personal information in connection with these activities.  Personal 
    Information requested in these activities may include contact information (e.g., your name and shipping address) 
    and demographic information (e.g., your zip code or age level).  We use this information to notify you if
