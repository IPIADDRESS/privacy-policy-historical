				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the online privacy practices for The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence ("AI2") and applies to the information AI2 collects through www.allenai.org (the "Site"). By accessing and/or using the Site, you, the user ("you") are consenting to the collection, storage, and disclosure of data as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.</p>
				<p>AI2 reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter, update, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy. We will post any changes to this Policy on this page so you can readily review the most current version. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the bottom of this Privacy Policy the date it was last updated.  We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how AI2 is helping to protect the personal information we collect.  If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments.  Your continued use of this Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
				<p><strong>Your IP Address</strong><br>
				An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When a user requests a page from the Site, our servers will log the user's current IP address. AI2 uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer the Site.</p>
				<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
				The Site is developed using Active Server Pages (ASP), and AI2 uses per-session "cookies" (pieces of data your browser stores in your computer's memory at AI2's request) to establish user sessions on our server. AI2 uses the cookies to carry information about usage from page to page through the Site. AI2 does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer.  Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. If you disable cookies, your browser may experience some erratic behavior on some portions of the Site.</p>
				<p><strong>Personal Information Collected</strong><br>
				The Site does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information about its users. If at any time AI2 allows you to sign up to receive updates or newsletters from us via the Site or if you choose to send a submission to us through the Site, AI2 will ask you to provide personal information about yourself, including, without limitation your name and email address.  Any personal information about you that you provide at our request through the Site is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Information."</p>
				<p><strong>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
				Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, to the extent it collects Personal Information, AI2 will not sell, trade or otherwise provide Personal Information to any third party other than to entities affiliated with AI2 or agents that AI2 engages to perform functions on our behalf.    AI2 may compile and provide aggregate statistics about our Site visitors to third parties, but these statistics will not include any Personal Information.</p>
				<p><strong>Protection of Children's Personal Information</strong><br>
				The Site is a general audience site and is not directed to children under the age of 13.  We do not intentionally or knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>
				<p><strong>Submission Information</strong><br>
				Any information you choose to send through the Site other than Personal Information, including, without limitation, submissions, ideas, inventions, comments or suggestions about the Site or any project of AI2, business proposals and feedback regarding the Site is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Submission Information."  As described in our <a href="terms-of-use.html" class="hotlink">Terms of Use</a>, AI2 does not accept or collect Submission Information on a confidential or proprietary basis.  Consequently, AI2 is free to use Submission Information for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
				<p><strong>Disclosures to Third Parties</strong><br>
				Because AI2 does not accept or collect Submission Information on a confidential or proprietary basis, from time to time AI2 may disclose your Submission Information to third parties, including, without limitation, other users of the Site, other potential investors, our consultants, our representatives, our affiliated companies and others.</p>
				<p><strong>Disclosures for Legal Reasons</strong><br>
				AI2 will also disclose Submission Information or Personal Information when it believes, in its sole discretion, that the law requires such disclosure or that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, protect and defend our rights or property or that of others, or act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of the public or the users of the Site.</p>
				<p><strong>Links</strong><br>
				This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by AI2. Other Web sites (including those that AI2 may link to) may have their own policies. AI2 has no responsibility for or control over the information-collection practices of such third party Web sites.
				</p><p>YOU ACCESS LINKED SITES AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL AI2 BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY ASPECT ANY LINKED SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY LINKED SITE.</p>
				<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
				If AI2 is going to use Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection through the Site; AI2 will notify those from whom AI2 has collected Personal Information via email. You will then have a choice as to whether or not AI2 may continue using your information in this different manner. In addition, if AI2 makes any material changes in its privacy practices that do not affect Personal Information already collected through the Site, AI2 will post a notice on the Site notifying users of the change.</p>
