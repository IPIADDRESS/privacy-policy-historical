						<h3>Information Collection</h3>
						<p>We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our Site, the information may be sent to our servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.</p>
						<p><strong>User Provided Information.</strong> Although we do not solicit your personal information on this Site, we may collect and store any personal information you provide to us in some other manner, such as when you contact us for help. This includes identifying information (such as your name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number), and any other personal information you choose to provide while using our Site. </p>
						<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collection Technology.</strong> We use various technologies to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Site. For example, we collect and store non-personally identifying information through cookies, log files, clear gifs (“web beacons”), and third parties to create a profile of our users that details the users’ viewing preferences.</p>

							<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s computer that tracks non-personal information about the user. When using our Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us to improve the quality of our Service and to personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to automatically collect information about your activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while using our Site.

We also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the quality of our Site.</li>
