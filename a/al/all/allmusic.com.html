            <h2>Your Information: What We Collect, How We Collect It, and How It Is Used</h2>

            <p>
                In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the
                AMN Properties. Any data we gather through your use of AMN Property falls into three categories: (1)
                personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register
                (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, register your device,
                complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is
                collected as you use AMN Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and
                (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use AMN Property,
                including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a “cookie” (cookies are
                discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on AMN Property.
                Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed,
                interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We
                use this information to better provide products and services, including, without limitation,
                to better target advertising and content, (on our and our Partner's websites) and to generate
                statistics and reports.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may use certain AMN Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless
                build a history of your interactions with the AMN Property even though we don't know who you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                In respect of certain AMN Properties which are products, AMN may also employ update management
                software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product,
                version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple AMN Properties,
                AMN may combine or link information collected from various AMN Properties and use it for the
                purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

            <h2>Personal information</h2>

            <p>
                As is common across websites, to use certain features of AMN Property we ask you to register, create an
                account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an
                account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in
                your profile).  When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as
                name, address, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in
                order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using
                it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive
                newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or
                to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                AMN may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the AMN Properties. To
                enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so
                that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that
                you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.
            </p>
            <p>
                To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address,
                shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information
                to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use
                it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general
                AMN will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have
                provided these details and you consent to our so doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking
                and recommendations.

            <p>
                When you visit AMN websites and other AMN Properties, we and our advertising partners may store and

            <p>
                Email addresses are used for identification, inviting new friends to AMN Properties, searching for and
                finding friends, general communication, order processing and to send notifications to you. To facilitate
                searching for and finding friends on the AMN Properties, AMN allows users to search for other members
                using text searches, first and last name, email address, and by using other attributes. Users can
                invite friends to join certain AMN Properties by sending invitation emails via our automated
                invitation system. Where permitted by applicable law, AMN stores these email addresses so that
                the respondents may be added to the friend list of the member sending the invitations and to
                establish relationships between users.
