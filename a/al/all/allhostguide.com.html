</a></h4><br>
<div class="ArticleText">If you are anything like me, you'd probably like to have a website on the Internet but you just have no idea how to go about it. All this talk of web hosting, bandwidth, disc space, and other jargon can cause one to say, "This is too complicated and technical, I just wanted to have a place to put all of my favorite skateboarding photos, cool information on ramp designs, and the best places to skate!" To get a website on the Web you have to go through a web host. The question is how do you find the web host for you?<br><p>
If you type ï¿½web host' into your search engine like Google you will get thousands of sites. Hit on one of these and like any product on the market you will see all sorts of persuasive propaganda to incite you to use their company; that is if you can decipher any of the technical jargon that only computer-heads can comprehend. Some web hosts offer free business cards with an account; some probably offer free watches...like all consumer industries you the buyer must beware. <br></p><p>
I'm a writer so I'll use the analogy of a writer's journal. The journal I like must not be too big or small in book size. It also must have a good amount of space allocated to each day, again not a whole page but not just a few lines. Of course I also want it to be cheap but of a good quality that won't fall apart while I'm using it, and I hope it would last for posterity. I just want the diary, some nice pictures in it are O.K. but unnecessary especially if it adds to the price.<br></p><p>

</a></h4><br>
<div class="ArticleText">Do you use third-party services to track the links on your Web site? What about for processing your online credit card payments? If so, you are probably losing sales that you  don't even know about. Sorry, but it's a fact.<br><p>
Third-Party Services Defined.<br></p><p>
Let me explain what I mean by "third-party" services. These are the "link tracking" type of services that one can purchase from various online companies. People use the special html link codes that these services provide to keep track of how visitors move around their Web sites. In return for a monthly fee, the user gets online access to a Web site that stores their link tracking information on a database, and gives them access to tracking statistics. This allows users to quickly and easily find out such things as which links visitors to their Web sites click on, and how often.<br></p><p>
But, it's not just link tracking services I'm talking about here. Payment processing gateways is another type of third- party service that many of us are dependent upon.<br></p><p>
