</p><p><a name="type"><b>Types of Information We Collect</b></a><br>
</p><ul>
<li> <b>Personal Information.</b>  Personal information is information that specifically identifies 
an individual, such as a customer's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card 
or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked 
to that person such as information about his or her purchases.  Personal information also 
includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences, 
when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual. 
<br><br>

</li><li> <b>Aggregate Information.</b>  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information.  
Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or 
customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.  In other words, information 
about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the 
same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.  Likewise, 
information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about 
the products purchased by others.  Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs 
so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services 
to customer desires.  We may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for 
various purposes, such as helping us better understand and improve our services, and for advertising 
and marketing purposes.
</li></ul>
<div align="right"><a href="/privacy.asp#top">TOP</a></div>
<p>

<a name="how"><b>How We Collect and Use Personal Information</b></a><br>
Allrecipes.com collects personal information from you at several different points on our Website, as 
set forth below.  In general, we use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected 
(such as to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, for billing purposes, 
and to anticipate and resolve problems with our Website and our products and services), for our
 own internal business operations, to respond to customer support inquiries and for other purposes 
 as described below.
</p><p>
<a name="reg"><b>I. Registration, Purchases; Other Information Submissions</b></a><br> 

</p><ul>
<li> When you register to become a member on our Website, you are asked to create a unique login 
and password, and are required to give certain personal information (such as your name, email 
address, and zip code).  We may also request certain information about your tastes and preferences 
(such as your favorite food, purchases or recipes).</li>

<li> Information you provide during registration may be used for some or all of the following:</li>
<ul>
<li> to provide services you have requested, or to otherwise fulfill your request; and</li>
<li> to contact you from time to time (i) about services on our Website for which you have expressed interest; (ii) with news, (iii) for internal marketing, informational, and promotional purposes; or (iv) for any other lawful purpose related to your use of the Website.</li>
</ul>

<li> Additionally, your registration information may be used, together with other information you submit to us in conjunction with your use of the Website, for the following purposes:</li>
<ul>
 <li> for editorial purposes, such as when you submit a recipe to us (e.g., to attribute your submitted recipe to you);</li>
 <li> to contact you for any reason regarding content you have submitted to the Website (e.g., to ask you a question about a recipe you have submitted); and</li>
 <li> to identify you by name when posting content you submit to us on the Website (e.g., when you request a recipe on the Website, to post your name and a description of the recipe you are requesting).</li>
</ul>

<li> If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to view offers for goods and 
services that are available from selected third party companies ("Co-Registration Vendors"), we 
will make certain  contact and demographic information you provide during registration (e.g., 
name, age, and/or email address) available to these vendors.  If you request goods or services 
from a Co-Registration Vendor, you may be asked to submit additional demographic and other personal 
information.  The Co-Registration Vendor may use your registration information which we provide to 
it, along with any information you submit directly to it, to fulfill, or secure fulfillment of, your 
request.  For additional information about disclosure of your personal information to our 
Co-Registration Vendors, and their use thereafter, please see the "Disclosure of Personal 
Information" section below.</li>

<li> We collect personal information such as your credit card, credit card billing address, and 
related billing information if you purchase products or services on our Website.  We use this 
information to fulfill your orders and bill you for them.</li>
</ul>
<div align="right"><a href="/privacy.asp#top">TOP</a></div>
<p>
<a name="news"><b>II. Newsletters</b></a>
<br>
When you submit your email address to us to initiate a subscription to one of our newsletters, 
we ask for personal information such as your name and email address.  This personal information 
is only used to send you the newsletter(s) you have requested.  You may opt-out of such follow-up 
contacts by following the instructions in the newsletter.  Please also note that we use a "double 
opt-in" process to confirm your subscription to our newsletters.  When you initiate a subscription 
to one of our email newsletters, we send a confirmation email message to the email address.  We 
only subscribe your email address to the newsletter after you follow the steps in the confirmation 
email message.
</p><div align="right"><a href="/privacy.asp#top">TOP</a></div>
<p>
<a name="email"><b>III. E-mail-A-Friend</b></a><br>
When you elect to use our referral service for emailing a recipe or other content to a friend, we 
ask you for your friend's name and email address.  Allrecipes.com will automatically send your 
friend a one-time email on your behalf which contains the recipe or other content, and which 
invites your friend to visit the Website.  Allrecipes.com uses your friend's name and email 
address only to send this one-time email, and does not store this information.  If your friend 
does not wish to receive "email-a-friend" messages to be sent on your behalf, he or she must 
contact you directly.  Allrecipes.com users may not use our referral service to send unwanted 
spam to others. 

</p><div align="right"><a href="/privacy.asp#top">TOP</a></div>
<p>
<a name="contest"><b>IV. Contests, Promotions, Offers and Surveys</b></a><br>
From time to time our Website requests personal information from users via contests, promotions, 
offers, and surveys.  Participation in these contests, promotions, offers, and surveys is 
completely voluntary and you therefore may choose whether to disclose personal information 
in connection with these activities.  Personal Information requested in these activities may 
include contact information (e.g., your name and shipping address) and demographic information 
(e.g., your zip code or age level).  We use this information to notify you if you've won and 
to award prizes.  We use information we collect in surveys for internal purposes, such as to 
ascertain the use of this Website and improve its usefulness to you.  We may also provide third 
parties with this information, and may combine it with some or all of your registration 
information.  Third parties may use the information we provide them to contact you regarding 
products or services that may be of interest to you.  These disclosures are discussed in greater 
detail below in the "Disclosure of Personal Information" section.  When we provide information 
collected during a contest, promotion, offer, or survey on the Website to third parties, we 
always disclose this to you at the time of collection.

</p><div align="right"><a href="/privacy.asp#top">TOP</a></div>

<p>

<a name="cust"><b>V. Customer Service.</b></a><br>
  
We collect personal information when you submit comments, questions or suggestions to our 
customer service department.  We use the information you provide to respond to your submission. 

</p><p>
<a name="cookie"><b>VI. Cookies, Web Beacons and Log Files</b></a><br> 
</p><ul>
<li> <b>Cookies.</b>  We use "cookie" technology on our Website.  We may place one or more cookies 
in the browser file of your computer.  Although such cookies do not contain any personally 
identifying information about you, we may link this information to personal information about you.  
If we do, we will treat it as personal information under this Privacy Policy.  We use cookies to 
provide functional information about your browser, which is recorded in the Website's logs and which 
allows us to provide a better experience on our Website.  We also use cookies to gather broad 
demographic information and general usage patterns about you and other users of our Website.  
In the course of placing advertisements on this Website, our third-party advertisers may place or 
recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</li>   

<li> <b>Web Beacons.</b>  We use, and permit third parties to use, "web beacons" (also known as 
Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and web bugs) 
on our Website and in our e-mail newsletters, to monitor the effectiveness of advertising and for 
other lawful purposes.  These web beacons do not collect personally identifying information about 
you on our Website. </li>

<li> <b>Log Files.</b>  We track log files on our Website (i.e., we log your computer's IP address 
into our log files when you visit a page on our Website) and use them to analyze trends, administer 
the Website, track your movements on the Website, and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use.  We may link some or all of this information to personally identifiable information 
that is stored on a cookie in your computer.  We only use information gathered from these activities 
for our internal marketing and operational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<a name="disclose"><b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b></a>

Allrecipes.com will not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your 
prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy. 
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <b>Consent.</b>  With your consent, we may disclose your personal information to third 
parties in order to provide you with products and services that you have requested.</li>

<ul>  
<li> During or immediately following registration, you have the option to view and select offers 
from various third party companies that may be of interest to you, such as retailers and consumer 
products manufacturers.  These offers are made available to you by our Co-Registration Vendors.  
If you choose to view these offers we will make information you provide during registration available 
to these vendors.  The vendors will forward this information, along with any other information you 
provide in conjunction with your request, to companies you have selected in order to fulfill, or 
facilitate fulfillment of, your request(s).  Our Co-Registration Vendors are contractually obligated 
to keep all such information confidential and to only use it for the purposes for which it was 
provided.  If you do not select any of the available offers, the vendors will delete your information 
which they have been provided.  Please note, however, that any information that is passed on by these 
vendors to third party companies that you select is subject to those third parties' privacy 
practices.</li>

<li> With your consent, we may disclose information you provide to us during registration to third 
parties in conjunction with (i) your entry into a contest or promotion, (ii) your request of an 
offer, or (iii) your participation in a survey or similar activity on the Website.  You may be asked 
for additional information in order to enter the contest or promotion, request an offer, or 
participate in a survey.  The third parties will use the information we provide to them, along with 
any information you provide during your entry, request, or participation, in order to (i) notify you 
if you have won a prize in a contest or sweepstakes, and (ii) to fulfill, or facilitate fulfillment 
of, requests for products or services you may make in connection with your entry, request, or 
participation.   These third parties are contractually obligated to keep all such information 
confidential and to only use it for the purposes for which it was provided.  When we provide 
information collected during a contest, promotion, offer, or survey on the Website to third parties, 
we always disclose this to you at the time of collection</li>

</p><li> <a name="own"><b>Allrecipes.com's Own Business Purposes.</b></a>  We use and disclose information about you for our 
own internal statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, 
measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, user interest, purchasing and 
other trends among our users.  We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal information 
about you to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these 
third parties is restricted to performance of such tasks.  We may also share personal information 
with third-party vendors who assist us in performing internal functions necessary to operate our 
business.  We require our third party vendors to keep such information confidential and to only 
use the information for the purpose it was provided.</li>  

<li> <a name="protect"><b>Protection of Allrecipes.com and Others:</b></a>  We disclose personal information when we believe
