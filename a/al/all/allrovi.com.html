            <p>Your use of and access to any Rovi Property (see definition of Rovi Property in our <a href="/about/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>)
    made available to you directly or indirectly from this website are subject to this privacy policy.
    This privacy policy explains the data that we collect and how we use it.</p>

<p>We respect your privacy. If you have any privacy concerns or questions about this privacy policy,
    you can contact us by email at: <a href="mailto:legal@rovicorp.com">legal@rovicorp.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>About us and this policy</u></strong></p>

<p>All references to “we”, “us” or “our” refer to (1) Rovi Corporation and/or, at Rovi Corporation’s discretion, one or more of its corporate
    affiliates (for all users located outside Europe); and (2) for all users located in Europe, Rovi Europe Limited.</p>

<p>Rovi Corporation is incorporated in the State of Delaware and its principal office is 2830 De La Cruz Boulevard, Santa, Clara, California 95050.
    Rovi Europe Limited is incorporated in England with registered number 0296781 and has its registered office Malvern House, 14-18 Bell Street,

<p>This policy gives you the details of who we are and the details of our privacy policies, including: what information we collect about you
    when you use Rovi Property; what organization is collecting the information; how the information will be used or disclosed; what choices are
    available to you regarding collection and use of the information; what security measures are in place to protect your personal information;
    and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>

<p>This Policy may be amended from time to time without notice and it is your responsibility to read it carefully and review any changes that may
    have been made. Since changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly.</p>

<p>For all users in locations other than in Europe, this policy and the processing of your online account data and any other data we collect shall
    be governed by the laws of the State of California and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara, California.
    For all users located in Europe, this policy and the processing of your online account data and any other data we collect in providing Rovi Property
    shall be governed by the laws of England and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts</p>

<p><strong><u>YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED</u></strong></p>
<p>In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the Rovi Properties. Any information we do gather
    via Rovi Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply when you register, create an online account, complete a survey,
    enter a contest, provide your e-mail address in order to receive services, etc.; (2) information that is collected as you use Rovi Property that then
    becomes specifically identified with your personal information and (3) anonymous information collected as you use Rovi Property using your IP address
    and a standard piece of data stored on your computer called a “cookie”. Information collected includes which pages and content that you browse, how
    you interact with advertising and our content, how long you spend looking at each page and a picture we build up of your preferences and usage. We
    use this information in order to provide more relevant services to you, including advertising, to improve the usefulness and effectiveness of the
    information displayed on the Rovi Properties and the effectiveness of its layout in helping users reach that information.</p>

<p>Certain Rovi Property or certain features of Rovi Properties may be used anonymously by you, and you will not be required to register or create an
    account for those Rovi Properties and we will not collect your personally identifiable information. As described above, we may build up a history
    of your anonymous interactions with the Rovi Properties in order to provide more relevant services to you and your interactions with Rovi Properties,
    even though we don’t know who you are.  For other Rovi Properties and other features of Rovi Properties, you may need to register, you may need to
    create an account and we may collect your personally identifiable information.  </p>

<p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong></p>

<p>As is common across websites, to use certain features of allrovi.com (including the Rovi Property available on allrovi.com), we ask you to register, 
    create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to 
    fill out a form (also known as your profile) with information about yourself.  When you create your profile, we collect personally identifiable 
    information about yourself such as name, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to conduct 
    activities including</p>
<p> to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily
    participate in surveys or contests and to communicate with you about our services and other products or services we think may be of interest to you.
    We also collect this data to provide personalised services to you such as providing you with recommendations or to track and provide you with information
    about your preferences and things such as your likes, dislikes and ratings.  We also use it in an anonymized and aggregated form to better understand
    our user base in order to be able to improve our site features, services and functionality.  This information is also used for the other purposes as
    described below</p>

<p><strong>Tracking information -- Cookies, Clear GIFs, and IP addresses</strong></p>
<p>We store and track user information by using "cookies" and clear GIFs, which are also sometimes called web bugs or web beacons. Cookies alone do not
    tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you opt to provide this information to us by, for example, by
    registering to use certain Rovi Properties. A cookie is data sent to your browser from a web server. It is stored on your computer's hard drive,
    and contains a unique identifier that allows our sites to recognize your computer. If you have an account with Rovi, a cookie on your computer
    lets us remember your user name and password so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit the site. It also helps us to
    try to ensure that your account is only accessed and used by you.</p>

<p>The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and you will find they are currently used by many major websites. You can set your web browser
    preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. We do not require you to use cookies, but
    please keep in mind that certain features and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies.</p>

<p>"Clear GIFs" are very small image files that we sometimes place on web pages and within web-based email newsletters or other communication we
    send. Together with cookies, clear GIFs let us accurately count the number of unique users who have visited specific pages and the number of
    times those pages are accessed. Clear GIFs also let us know how many people opened an email.</p>

<p>When you use any of the Rovi Property, we may use cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technology to collect information such as your browser
    type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, IP address, pages visited on the site, services
    used and how you have used them.</p>

<p>We aggregate this information to track services used and/or on-site activityin order to make the site more useful to you. We may provide
    aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and service and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and
    our business partners), but we will use reasonable efforts to anonymize that information and provide it only in an aggregated form that does
    not personally identify you.</p>

<p>We may use this information to provide you with tracking information about your own use of Rovi Property as well as your ratings, preferences
    and what content you like or dislike on Rovi Property.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We may use your personal information and non-personal information to serve ads to you via Rovi Property as well as to provide you with
    promotions, products and services.  We may also use third-party advertising companies and other business partners to serve ads on Rovi Property
    and provide you with promotions, products and services. These third-party advertising companies and our business partners may be located
    throughout the world. </p>

<p>These third-party advertising companies and business partners may receive anonymous information about you and that information can include: date
    and time of ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, your IP address and your interactions with the advertisements.  These third-party advertising
    companies and business partners may use cookies, clear GIFs and anonymous information about your visits to Rovi Property and other websites to
    measure and improve the effectiveness of their ads, promotions, products and services.  This information may also be used for online preference
    and other targeted marketing purposes. The information received by these third-party advertising companies and business partners is subject to
    the privacy policies of these third-party advertising companies and business partners. We may be given access to this information by these
    third-party advertising companies and business partners.</p>

<p><u>With your consent as indicated when you set up your account</u>, we may make certain information about you (including personal information) available
    to third-party advertising companies and other business partners under agreements between us and those third-party advertising companies and
    business partners.  The third-party advertising companies and business partners will use that information to target advertising to you or
    provide and market promotions, products and services to you.  You may withdraw your consent to our providing your personal information to
    advertising companies and business partners at any time by adjusting your preferences in the preference page of the relevant Rovi Property.
    If you do so we will not provide your personal information from the relevant Rovi Property to third party advertisers or business partners
    from the time you opt out. However we may still provide them with anonymised or aggregated information from which they may send you targeted
    advertisements.</p>

<p><strong><u>SECURITY</u></strong></p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, due to the design
    of the Internet, ever-changing technology and other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and
    our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. We will have no liability for disclosure of personally identifiable
    information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties.</p>

<p><strong><u>COMMITMENT TO CHILDRENS PRIVACY</u></strong></p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. For that reason, none of our Rovi Properties are directed at anyone under 13 and they
    are not structured specifically to attract anyone under 13.  We also do not collect or maintain personally identifiable information from those
    users who we actually know are under 13. Should we learn or be notified that we have collected information from users under the age of 13, we will
    immediately delete such personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong><u>CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION &amp; PREFERENCES</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Right to Choose</strong><br>
When you register to access certain Rovi Properties, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive announcements from us by opting out
at the time you give us your personally identifiable information. You may also later opt out of providing us personal identifiable information
by changing your preferences in the set up areas of the Rovi Properties or changing the necessary settings in your profile. For certain Rovi
Properties opting out may only be possible if you delete your account for that Rovi Property.   If you opt out or do not provide your personal
information then some services and features (such as personal information services, recommendations and tracking of ratings and likes and dislikes)
may not be available to you. All newsletters and email announcements from us will contain an unsubscribe link that also allows you to opt out at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Review and Correction</strong><br>
You may review and update the personally identifiable information that you have provided us by visiting the relevant set up page of the Rovi Property and
updating your account profile.</p>

<p><strong><u>OTHER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></strong></p>
<p>We will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except as described in this privacy policy;  as required by
    court order or other government or law enforcement authorities in order to comply with legal process or law; in the event of a merger where another
    company has acquired the relevant Rovi Property; in order to protect against the misuse or unauthorized use of Rovi Property; in order to protect
    and defend our rights and property; or in order to protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.</p>

<p><strong><u>Links to Third Party Websites</u></strong></p>
<p>The Website and our Services may display links to websites operated by third parties. If you click on a link, the relevant third party operator or
    others may collect data about you when you visit the linked website. They are responsible for the collection and further processing of such data
    and we have no control over it. We advise you to check the terms of use and privacy policies of any linked websites you visit to find out what
    data they are collecting and the purposes for which they process your personal data.</p>

<p><strong><u>OVERSEAS TRANSFERS AND PROCESSING OF YOUR INFORMATION</u></strong></p>
<p>Your personally identifiable information may be used by us and our affiliates, subsidiaries and our suppliers who may be located in countries
    outside the country where you are located. By providing your personal information to us you consent to us and our suppliers processing your data
    in any jurisdiction in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong><u>YOUR CONSENT</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>BY USING ALLROVI.COM AND/OR ANY ROVI PROPERTIES, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION DESCRIBED IN THIS
        PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>If you are located in Europe, some of the data that we process may be protected by data protection laws in the United Kingdom such as the Data 
    Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”). Under the Act, you have certain rights to request information about, get access to or request the amendment 
    of any such personal data. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@rovicorp.com">legal@rovicorp.com</a>.
