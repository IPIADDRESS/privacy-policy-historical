    <p>
     <strong> PROTECTION NOTICE &amp; COOKIE POLICY</strong></p>
     <br>
    <p>The Company is committed to protecting your privacy. The Company knows that you care how information about
                you is used and appreciates your trust in it to do that carefully and sensibly.
                At times you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (name,
                email address, postcode etc.). By entering your details in the fields as requested
                you enable the Company to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you
                provide such personal information, the Company will treat that information in accordance
                with this notice and policy. All service related email correspondence includes instructions
                on how to ‘unsubscribe’ from the service to which you have subscribed. Our services
                are designed to give you the information that you want to receive not to bombard
                you with information you do not want. The Company will act in accordance with current
                legislation.
                
    </p><br>
    <p><strong>Use of Data.</strong></p><br>
    <p>The Company will
                use your personal details and information it obtains from other sources to provide
                you with its goods and services, for administration and customer services, for credit
                scoring, for marketing, to analyse your purchasing preferences and to ensure that
                the content, services and advertising that it offers are tailored to your needs
                and interests. The Company may keep your information for a reasonable period for
                these purposes. The Company may need to share your information with its service
                providers and partners. The Company may disclose personal data in order to comply
                with a legal or regulatory obligation.

    <br><p><strong>What are Cookies?</strong></p><br>
    <p> Cookies are small
                pieces of information that a Internet Site might store on your computer or access
                device. They allow Internet Sites to remember who you are. Typically your browser
                will store each cookie as a small text file. A cookie will always contain the domain
                name of the originating Internet Site. For security, only the originating Internet
                Site has permission to read the cookie.
       
    </p>
    <br><p><strong> Cookies are Used.</strong></p><br>
    <p> When you log
                in to the Internet Site the Company will set a cookie containing a randomly generated
                unique reference number. This anonymous number allows the Company to identify you.
                The Company will never store your personal information directly as a cookie. If,
                as you log in, you tick the checkbox labelled "Remember me", a persistent cookie
                will be set. Persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, and
                will allow the Internet Site to recognise you on your next visit.
       
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>does the Company use Cookies?</strong> </p><br>
                <p>Advanced features of the site use Cookies to provide information you requested and
                to reduce you having to key in repeated fields. Cookies allow the Company to see
                how the Internet Site is being used. This information forms the basis of future
                development work, and so enables the Company to continually improve its Internet
                Site to best suit its users. They also allow the Internet Site to remember you when
                you log-in saving you needing to login.</p>
    <br><p><strong> Cookies.</strong></p><br>
    <p> Cookies can be
                easily deleted or disabled at any time through your browser’s preference menus so
                please refer to the instructions for your file management software to locate the
                file or directory that stores cookies. Further information on controlling cookies
                is available at http://www.aboutcookies.org. Please be aware that if you do choose
                to disable cookies this site may not operate as expected and you may not be able
                to access various features.</p>
    <br><p><strong>IP Address.</strong></p><br>
    <p> When you visit
                our site, we may also log your IP address, a unique identifier for your connection
                at a point in time.</p>
    <p> The Company also
                includes web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or web bugs) in its emails to track
                the success of its marketing campaigns. This means that if you open an email from
                the Company it can see which pages of the Internet Site you visit.
       
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>Credit References.</strong></p><br>
    <p> In assessing
                your application for credit, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent
                money laundering, the Company may search the files of credit reference agencies
                who will record any credit searches on your file. The Company may also disclose
                details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The information will be
                used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people
                with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering
                prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors. Information used for these purposes
                will include publicly available information such as electoral roll, county court
                judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions.</p>
    <p> The Company may
                also share your information with its business partners in the travel, property,
                automotive, financial services, leisure, entertainment, advertising, media, retail
                and mail order business for marketing purposes or it may send you information about
                other organisations’ goods and services. The Company or its business partners may
                contact you by mail, telephone, fax, e-mail or other electronic messaging service
                with offers of goods and services or information that may be of interest to you
                e.g. holidays, cars, property, financial and leisure services, entertainment, media
                products, advertising, clothing or household goods. By providing the Company with
                your fax number, land line and/or mobile telephone numbers or email address you
                consent to being contacted by these methods for these purposes. If you do not wish
                to receive marketing information from the Company or from the Company’s business
                partners tick the appropriate box on the form you complete.
       
    </p>
    <br><p><strong>Personal Data out of the UK.</strong></p><br>
    <p> By providing the Company with your personal information
                you also consent to the Company transferring your information to countries or jurisdictions
                which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK, if necessary for
                the above purposes.</p>
    <br><p><strong> Party Data.</strong></p><br>
    <p>If you provide
                the Company with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed
                you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data including
                sensitive personal data and that you have informed them of the Company’s identity
                and the purposes (as set out above) for which their personal data will be processed.
