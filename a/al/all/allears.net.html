        <p>RYI Enterprises, LLC, (RYI) owns and operates <b>AllEars.net®</b>, which 
          comprises <b>the Unofficial Walt Disney World Information Guide</b>, 
          the <b>ALL EARS® </b>weekly newsletter and its companion promotional 
          newsletter <b>Ears the Deal™</b>, and the <b>Ears to Ears™</b> 
          moderated forum on Yahoo.</p>

        <p>RYI has created this <b>privacy statement</b> in order to demonstrate 
          our firm commitment to the users' privacy. The following discloses the 
          information gathering and dissemination practices for <b>AllEars.net</b><b>®.</b></p>

        <p><b>AllEars.net®  is committed to your privacy, and does not sell, exchange, or release 
          any of your individual personal information to a third party. </b></p>

        <h3>SCOPE OF POLICY</h3>
		<br>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to <b>AllEars.net</b><b>®</b>. 
          This privacy policy does not apply to other companies' or organizations' 
          websites that you may link to. You should carefully review the Privacy 
          Policy of other websites to determine how they treat personal information. </p>

        <h3>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND STORED</h3>
		<br>
        <p>When you browse through any web site, certain personal information about 
          you can be collected. Like most standard web site servers we use log 
          files. We automatically collect and temporarily store information about 
          your visit. We use this information for statistical purposes and to 
          help us make our site more useful to visitors. The data collected may 
          include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, domain name, browser type, 
          Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, 
          date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This data is used to analyze 
          trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, 
          and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Your IP 
          number is visible to most of the websites that you visit. <b>AllEars.net</b><b>®</b> 
          may use IP numbers to help diagnose problems with our servers and to 
          administer our Web site. </p>

        <p><b>AllEars.net®</b> 
          utilizes<b> a number of outside vendors to operate portions of the website 

          and/or newsletter. For instance, <a href="http://mailermailer.com" target="_blank">mailermailer.com</a></b> 
          is used for newsletter (<b>ALL EARS®</b> and<b> Ears the Deal</b>™) 
          distribution, and <b><a href="http://adspeed.com" target="_blank">adspeed.com</a></b> 
          for banner ad programs. Please see those sites for their privacy information.</p>

        <h3>PERSONALLY PROVIDED INFORMATION</h3>
		<br>
        <p>The only personally identifiable information about you that is collected 
          is that which you provide on a voluntary basis. We make every effort 
          to ensure that whatever information you provide is maintained in a secure 
          environment. </p>

        <p>RYI will not knowingly or intentionally disclose, give, sell or transfer 
          any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law 
          enforcement or statute. </p>

        <p>If you choose to subscribe to our weekly newsletter, <b>ALL EARS®</b>, 
          you will have to provide an e-mail address. <b>ALL 
          EARS®</b> is only delivered electronically.</p>

        <p>RYI utilizes Ad-rotator.com for banner rotation and statistics. Ad-rotator.com 
          maintains information on each visitor and all associated data for the 
          last 7 days. Other information is kept in compact forms. Ad-rotator 
          also tracks how many people are currently active on the site, where 
          they are and came from, which ads were viewed at what time. AllEarsNet® 
          webmasters have access to this information. </p>

        <h3>INFORMATION USE</h3>
		<br>
        <p>We reserve the right to perform statistical analysis of user behavior and 
          characteristics while visiting this site. We do this in order to measure 
          interest in and use of the site. We may share this information in the 
          aggregate with advertisers or potential advertisers. We will use information 
          to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and 
          how many have clicked on them. We provide only aggregate data from these 
          analyses to third parties. Advertisers will not be able to identify 
          any individual from the data provided.</p>

        <h3>COOKIES</h3>
		<br>
        <p>A cookie is a mechanism that allows a website to record your comings and 
          goings, usually without your knowledge or consent. <b>ALL 
          EARS® does not request cookies of its visitors.</b> However, our banner rotation 
          program is administered by a third party and may contain cookies. We 
          do not have access to this cookie information.  </p>

        <p>If you do not want to accept cookies from <b>AllEars.net</b><b>®</b> 
          or other sites, you must set your browser software to not accept cookies. Look 
          in the Preferences (Netscape) or Internet Options (Microsoft Internet 
          Explorer) feature to disable cookies. </p>

        <p>If you disable cookies you may not be able to use certain features on the 
          <b>AllEars.net®</b> websites. 
          Also, the disabling of cookies may prohibit your participation in contests 
          and drawings.</p>

        <h3>REGISTRATION FORMS </h3>
          <br>
          <p>The only registration form is for subscription to <b>ALL 
          EARS®</b>, the weekly newsletter sent to subscribers e-mail addresses. </p>

        <p>The <b>ALL EARS®</b> 
          registration form <b>requires</b> users to provide an e-mail address 
          and <b>requests </b>demographic information (like zip code and country). 
          Contact information from the registration forms is used to send out 
          the newsletter and to gather aggregate demographic data. The demographic 
          information is shared with advertisers and partners on an aggregate 
          basis only.</p>

        <p><b>ALL EARS®</b> subscribers have the option to sign up for <b>Ears the Deal™</b>: 
          special offers and announcements pertaining to Disney World and Central 
          Florida? By checking the yes box you agree to have your email address 
          added to an <b>AllEarsNet®</b> 
          special mailing list.</p>

        <p><b>Individual information is never shared with any third party. AllEars.net® does 
          NOT sell your email address or distribute it to any other entity.</b></p>

        <p><b>ALL EARS® is ONLY delivered via e-mail. </b>If the user does not provide an email 
          address, <b>ALL EARS®</b> 
          can not be delivered. An archive of the featured articles of previous 
          issues is available at the <b><a href="/ae/ae.htm">ALL EARS website</a></b>.</p>

        <h3>SURVEYS AND CONTESTS</h3>
		<br>
        <p>Occasionally our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation 
          in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore 
          has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. </p>

        <p>The requested information typically includes contact information (such as 
          name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip 
          code). <b>Depending on the estimated retail value of the prize, you 
          may be required to submit your Social Security Number for issuance of 
          a US Tax Form 1099. Contact information will be used and shared with 
          the contest sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. </b></p>

        <p><b>Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving 
          the use and satisfaction of this site. Your personally identifiable 
          information is not shared with third parties.</b> We provide only aggregate 
          data to third parties. Advertisers will not be able to identify any 
          individual from the data provided.</p>
