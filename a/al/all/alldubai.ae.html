Finance &amp; Banking Companies Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Dubai Banks &amp; Finance Companies List. List of the top best banks &amp; finance companies in Dubai, UAE. A financial institution in Dubai is an establishment that conducts financial transactions such as investments, loans and deposits. Almost everyone deals with financial institutions on a regular basis. Everything from depositing money to taking out loans and exchanging currencies must be done through financial institutions.

Banks in Dubai serve as payment agents within a country and between nations. Not only do banks in Dubai issue debit cards that allow account holders to pay for goods with the swipe of a card, they can also arrange wire transfers with other institutions. Banks in Dubai essentially underwrite financial transactions by lending their reputation and credibility to the transaction; a check is basically just a promissory note between two people, but without a bank's name and information on that note, no merchant would accept it. As payment agents, banks make commercial transactions much more convenient; it is not necessary to carry around large amounts of physical currency when merchants will accept the checks, debit cards or credit cards that banks provide.

Commercial banks in Dubai accept deposits and provide security and convenience to their customers. Part of the original purpose of banks was to offer customers safe keeping for their money. By keeping physical cash at home or in a wallet, there are risks of loss due to theft and accidents, not to mention the loss of possible income from interest. With banks, consumers no longer need to keep large amounts of currency on hand; transactions can be handled with checks, debit cards or credit cards, instead.

Investment banks in Dubai are far different than deposit-gathering commercial banks. An investment bank is a financial intermediary that performs a variety of services for businesses and some governments.&nbsp;Investment banks in Dubai services include underwriting debt and equity offerings, acting as an intermediary between an issuer of securities and the investing public, making markets, facilitating mergers and other corporate reorganizations, and acting as a broker for institutional clients.&nbsp;Investment banks in Dubai may also provide research and financial advisory services to companies in UAE. As a general rule, investment banks focus on initial public offerings (IPOs) and large public and private share offerings.

Insurance Companies in Dubai - Insurance companies in Dubai pool risk by collecting premiums from a large group of people who want to protect themselves and/or their loved ones against a particular loss, such as a fire, car accident, illness, lawsuit, disability or death. Insurance helps individuals and companies manage risk and preserve wealth. By insuring a large number of people, insurance companies can operate profitably and at the same time pay for claims that may arise. Insurance companies in Dubai use statistical analysis to project what their actual losses will be within a given class. They know that not all insured individuals will suffer losses at the same time or at all.

Brokerages in Dubai - A brokerage in Dubai acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers to facilitate securities transactions. Brokerage companies are compensated via commission after the transaction has been successfully completed. For example, when a trade order for a stock is carried out, an individual often pays a transaction fee for the brokerage company's efforts to execute the trade.

Investment Companies in Dubai - An investment company in Dubai is a corporation or a trust through which individuals invest in diversified, professionally managed portfolios of securities by pooling their funds with those of other investors. Rather than purchasing combinations of individual stocks and bonds for a portfolio, an investor can purchase securities indirectly through a package product like a mutual fund.">Finance &amp; Banking in Dubai</a>

List of Family Restaurants in Dubai. List of Top Best Family Dinning Restaurants in Dubai, UAE. Family friendly restaurants include a vast array of budget dining establishments that provide food, fun, and a rated-G atmosphere for children and adults alike. In general, family restaurants don't usually serve alcohol. If they do, the bar is separated from the dining areas of the establishment, allowing children to eat while not being exposed to that portion of the restaurant. On occasions when parents drink responsibly, it's not unusual for parents to have a drink or two at dinner.

Family friendly restaurants sometimes play host to children that are ready for fun and games. These establishments have a game area where children can play arcade games and other varieties of games that let them and their parents bond and have fun together. This type of atmosphere fits in perfectly with the &quot;family friend&quot; theme.

Not every family friend restaurant needs to be &quot;kid friendly.&quot; For parents with older children that no longer appreciate games like they once did, it's possible to find a dining establishment that has more grown up atmosphere. Many places have televisions that families can watch together, or live or recorded music to enjoy while eating dinner together.

Dubai&nbsp;is a beautiful city in the United Arab Emirates. Many tourists visit the city to relax and unwind while taking a day off from work.

Coffee shops also are great hang outs for social crowds too. You may have noticed this in some movies but it really is true. It is uncomfortable to meet someone you don't know in private so a coffee shop is safe. It can be boring to discuss business at the office so why not at a coffee shop?

Brunch - a portmanteau of the words breakfast and lunch - is a meal served between the two, often at weddings or sporting events. Because of the time of the meal, it is often regarded as a good time to meet friends, especially for those enjoying a lazy Friday.&nbsp;Dubai as a city has taken brunching to its heart and really elaborated on it. Visitors to Dubai are encouraged to sample local brunch culture and many residents often take guests out to enjoy the local cuisine. Hotels such as the Mina A'Salam are renowned for their brunches, serving traditional British dishes such as omelettes as well as more bizarre meal accompaniments such as candy floss.

Residents of Dubai recommend eating brunch outdoors to fully enjoy the meal and this means you have to plan to eat early enough to avoid the sweltering heat. Be warned that brunching is often akin to feasting in Dubai - especially in the last few years with many venues offering 'all you can eat and drink' deals - so after lounging around banqueting, visitors may need to have a lazy afternoon to fully process the experience. The large size of the meal is often matched by the magnitude of the bill, but the care put into the meal is often worth it.

From its humble origins in Eastern Asian, brunch has grown to be a worldwide phenomenon. The word 'brunch' has been adopted by French and German speakers, despite both languages having their own phrase or word for the meal - le grand petit dejeuner (&quot;the big breakfast&quot; or, more literally, &quot;the big little lunch&quot;) and Gabelfruhstuck (literally &quot;fork breakfast&quot;).">Brunches in Dubai</a> (83)

When it comes to restaurant food, people are always torn between dining in and having food delivery. Some would opt to dine in to enjoy a different ambience while others choose to order takeaway and enjoy eating at the comforts of their home.&nbsp;Although dining in is really a nice diversion from the common home-cooked meals, there are still a lot of individuals who would prefer to have their food delivered and eat just anywhere they want to. Well, it's not just about the experience but also for several other reasons.

Let's face it, not all of us always have the luxury of time to go out and enjoy restaurant food. With our fast-paced world, it is often hard to get our butts off our office chairs. Going online or making a call is just simply the best means to get our hands at those delicious restaurant foods during those busy hours. Ordering takeaway allows us to eat even gourmet meals despite the hectic schedule. It also provides instant solutions to unexpected events wherein you were not able to prepare anything to feed the guests. And of course, it's also very reliable at times you go home and have nothing for dinner.">Food Takeaway in Dubai</a> (73)

List of Massage Centers in Deira, Downtown Dubai, Dubai Marina, Dubai Mall, Jumeirah &amp; JLT.&nbsp;Massage is one of the most natural methods of healing and stress relief. While many people choose to reduce stress with prescription medications, many others visit a day spa weekly in order to relax after a hard week at work. Additionally, massage can also be very healing. Many athletes undergo massage treatment for sore muscles, twisted ankles, and torn ligaments.

Swedish Massage in Dubai -&nbsp;A Swedish massage is meant to relieve muscle tension and loosen sore joints. It is performed over the entire body. There are five major strokes used in Swedish massage. The first is effleurage, or stroking. The second is petrissage. This is a grabbing and lifting of the muscles. The third is friction. This is where the massage therapist massages the thickest parts of muscles by working their fingers and thumbs in a circular motion. The fourth is tapotement, or tapping and chopping strokes. The final major stroke used in Swedish massage is vibration. This is where the massage therapist flattens their fingers on a muscle and then shakes rapidly in order to create a vibration.

Deep Tissue Massage in Dubai -&nbsp;Deep tissue massage is a massage technique that targets the parts of muscle that lie far below the surface. All muscles in the human body have many layers, and the lower levels cannot be reached by normal massage techniques. Deep tissue massage therapists use their fingers, thumbs, and, occasionally, elbows to reach the deepest layers of muscle. Deep tissue massage generally involves quite a bit of pressure and friction.

Sports Massage in Dubai -&nbsp;A sports massage is not only used to relieve pain -- it is commonly used to prepare muscles prior to activity. Using techniques comparable to that of a Swedish massage, a sports massage can prepare muscles for activity and heighten an athlete's energy. After activity, a sports massage can cool muscles and prevent injury.

Rolfing in Dubai -&nbsp;Rolfing is a massage technique designed to restore a person's posture. Rolfing massage therapists use their hands and elbows to massage the connective tissue that surrounds muscles. The end result is a noticeable improvement in posture.

Thai Massage in Dubai -&nbsp;Thai massage is different European massage techniques in that it focuses on circulation and pressure points. Thai massage promotes internal health and muscle flexibility through peripheral stimulation. Thai massage therapists use their hands, elbows, knees and feet.

The massage techniques listed above are the most common forms of massage offered at day spas. However, there are many other massage techniques, and many go by alternate names.

One growing sector of the holiday accommodation market is resorts. For those of you who are not familiar with resorts, keep reading and I will lift the veil from your eyes.

As a general rule, resorts take care of your whole holiday experience not just giving you a roof over your head at night. This comes with it advantages, disadvantages and sometimes controversies.&nbsp;The centrepiece of all resorts is the hotel. Resort hotels operate in the same manner as any standard hotel you may or may not have visited during your years on this planet so I won't go over the details.

You won't have to go out of your way for a meal, entertainment or cocktails, just sit back, be pampered and let everything come to you.&nbsp;A spa resort can offer you the best way to achieve peace, relaxation and a favorable way to reduce stress during your pleasure vacation and to get a break from the busy and tough routine of professional life. Spa can be a great method of achieving relaxation in real sense and that is why many resorts nowadays are offering excellent spa services.

What better way is there to say that they've worked hard and deserve a little bit of the finer things in life?

When choosing a day spa, keep in mind that different spas offer different services. In many cases, day spas are ran in conjunction with a full-service beauty salon. That means that you can choose from a wide variety of services. Other day spas, though, may only offer massage and skin-care services without offering hair and nail services. You should also shop around. Prices from spa to spa can vary considerably.">Day Spas in Dubai</a> (49)
