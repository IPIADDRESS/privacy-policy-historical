        <p><font size="2" face="tahoma,sans-serif"><strong>Mailing Lists</strong><br>
        We may launch a mailing list for some or all of the Alliance Games Sites, in    order to provide subscribers with relevant information - breaking news, or    weekly or daily round-ups, for example. In order to sign up to receive    regular e-mails from a site's mailing list, users must submit information    including a valid e-mail address and demographic information such as location    and interests. Demographic information will be used in aggregate form only in    order to assess general user interest in various internal and third party    products and services. <br>
          <br>
          Users who choose to sign up for a mailing list will receive regular e-mails    from the site. Most of the time, these will be content from the site in    question, but we may periodically send out an e-mail from a third party    sponsor. Such e-mails do not represent an endorsement by Alliance Games of    any products, services or information advertised therein. Such e-mails will    clearly be marked as advertising: please check it out, as we hope you will    feel that it is relevant to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mails from    third party advertisers, please do not sign up for the mailing list. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="tahoma,sans-serif"><strong>Discussion Group and Cookies</strong><br>
          In order to further enhance the user experience; Alliance Games runs a    commenting service on some or all of the Alliance Games Sites where users can    discuss common topics of interest. Users have the option of signing up for    this service, and to do so must submit information including a valid e-mail    address. Alliance Games uses this information to screen out users who leave    comments prohibited by our terms and conditions of use and to pick out topics    of interest to discussion board users Alliance Games will not pass this    information to any other organization except in aggregate form. <br>
          <br>
          Some services Alliance Games offers may use cookies. A cookie is a piece of    data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
