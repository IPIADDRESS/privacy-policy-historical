		  <p>Allscripts respects the privacy of every person
               who visits our websites. This Privacy Statement outlines the Allscripts
               will collect and how we will use that information. This statement
               will also tell you how you can verify the accuracy of your personal
               information submitted to Allscripts through our websites, and
               how you can request that we delete or update your personal information.
               We have developed our privacy policy from industry guidelines
               and standards, and local, national, and international laws and
               requirements. This privacy policy is intended to comply with the
               safe harbor created by the U.S. Department of Commerce and approved
               by the European Union as compliant with the European Commission's
               Directive on Data Protection. This privacy policy should be interpreted
               as necessary to ensure compliance with the safe harbor. This summary
               highlights our strong commitment to protect your privacy. In addition
               to the privacy commitments outlined below, Allscripts complies
               with your country's privacy regulations. Thanks again for placing
               your trust in Allscripts.</p>
             <p><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW WE USE IT</strong></p>
             <p><strong>What We Collect</strong></p>
             <p>Allscripts primary goal in collecting personal information from
               you is to give you a meaningful, enjoyable and customized experience
               while using our websites and to allow us to develop new products
               and services that are relevant to visitors like you. Personal
               information also allows us to provide services and features that
               most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make
               your online experience smooth and efficient.</p>
             <p>A) Personal Information<br>
               To gain access to certain information on our websites, we need
                 to collect information identifying who you are, your e-mail
                 address and your mailing address. Visitors may also be asked
                 to select a user ID and password. If you opt not to provide
                 your personal information, you can still access our websites;
                 however, you may be unable to gain access to certain information. </p>
             <p>B) Aggregate and Statistical Data<br>
               Allscripts may collect certain aggregate data called web log information
                 (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited,
                 etc.) and use cookies when you visit sites. For instance, when
                 you visit one of our sites, our web server will automatically
                 recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited
                 to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited,
                 the referrer (the website you came from), the type of browser
                 you are using (e.g. Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of
                 operating system you are using (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS),
                 and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider
                 (e.g., AOL). Neither the web log information nor cookies collects
                 any personal information. They do not contain personal information,
                 such as your name or e-mail address, and in no way are used
                 to identify our users. </p>
             <p><strong>How We Use It</strong></p>
             <p>A) Personal Information <br>
               We also use personal information about you to improve our marketing
                 and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze site usage;
                 to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize
                 our sites' content, layout and services. We may also use your
                 information to deliver information to you that, in some cases,
                 is targeted to your interests, new services and promotions.
                 We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better
                 tailor it to meet our visitors' needs Allscripts does not collect
                 personal information automatically, but we may combine non-personal
                 information collected automatically (e.g., through web log data)
                 with your previously submitted personal information. B) Aggregate
                 and Statistical Data Allscripts uses web log information (such
                 as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.)
                 to help us design our website, to identify popular features,
                 and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be
                 used if necessary to help identify any person attempting to
                 break into or damage our website. We may share web log information
                 with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence
                 of a violation of computer security or related laws. </p>
             <p><strong>DATA SHARING AND TRANSFER </strong></p>
             <p>How We May Share Information Except as stated below, we will
               not share, trade or sell personal information of our visitors
               for use by any business. However, aggregated and statistical data
               from our visitors may be shared with our partners. For example,
               we may let a partner know that approximately "75% of our
               visitors use high speed connections or access our site after 7pm." Occasionally,
               we may share personal information from you (such as name, mailing
               addresses and e-mail addresses) with vendors, contractors or partners
               of Allscripts in connection with services that these individuals
               or entities perform for or with Allscripts. These vendors, contractors
               or partners are restricted from using this data in any way other
               than to provide services for Allscripts, and they may not share
               or resell this data. The services they provide may include such
               activities as direct mailing, fulfillment services, or e-mail
               campaigns. Allscripts may share your information with any person
               or company that acquires Allscripts business or any portion of
               the Allscripts business to which your information relates. Allscripts
               will ensure that any person or company to which your information
               is transferred agrees to abide by the same privacy obligations
               as Allscripts. Allscripts also reserves the right to share the
               information to respond to duly authorized information requests
               of governmental authorities or where required by law. Data Transfers
               Your personal information will generally be stored in our Allscripts
               databases, which are located in various geographies within the
               United States. Allscripts's data protection standards are the
               same, regardless of where your personal information is stored.
               Allscripts adheres to U.S. Department of Commerce European Union
               Safe Harbor principles. If you feel that we may have violated
               Safe Harbor privacy principles, you may contact Allscripts or
               the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with your complaint. </p>
             <p><strong>COOKIES </strong></p>
             <p>Cookies help us in many ways to make your visit to our websites
               more enjoyable and meaningful to you. Cookies are text information
               files that your web browser places on your computer when you visit
               a website. Physicians Interactive Allscripts may use such "cookie" technology
               to obtain non-personal information from you as an online visitor.
               As an example, this might entail recognizing several web page
               requests coming from the same computer and therefore the same
               visitor. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be
               configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is
               being sent. </p>
             <p><strong>DATA SECURITY </strong></p>
             <p>Allscripts is committed to keeping the data you provide us secure
               and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal
               information from loss, misuse or alteration. Vendors, contractors,
               or partners of Allscripts who have access to your personal information
               in connection with providing services for Allscripts are required
               to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to
               use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the
               services they are performing for us. When necessary, we use secure
               connections on our web sites to protect information during its
               transmission. </p>
             <p><strong>ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND COMPLAINTS </strong></p>
             <p>We attempt to keep your files complete, up-to-date, and accurate.
               We tell you how and where to conveniently access your personal
               information and how to notify us about errors. We are committed
               to working with you to obtain fair and rapid resolution of any
               complaints or disputes about privacy. </p>
