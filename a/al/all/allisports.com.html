  <h1 class="page-title2">PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h1>

  <p>This is the official privacy policy (“<u>Privacy Policy</u>”) for allisports.com ("<u>Site</u>," "<u>we</u>," "<u>us</u>," or "<u>our</u>"), an Internet websiteoffered in cooperation with the ALLI, Alliance of Action Sports, LLC (f/k/a Action Sports, LLC) (“<u>ALLI</u>”). This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("<u>Personal Information</u>") collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by ALLI and any subsidiaries and affiliates of the ALLI (collectively, “<u>Affiliates</u>”), or any other company, unless specifically stated.</p>
  
  <h4>Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to: </h4>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected; </li>
    <li>How we use your Personal Information; </li>
    <li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; </li>
    <li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
    <li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (“<u>U.S.</u>”) and certain features on this Site may only be offered and made available to those above the age of 13. If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information. ThisPrivacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="terms" title="Terms of Use Agreement">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Any terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Use Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.;</p>
  
  <p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site’s homepage and/or will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates.</p>
  
  <p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information.</p>
  
  <h4>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4>
  
  <p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “<u>unsubscribe</u>”) or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. </p>
  
  <p>ALLI qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. </p>
  
  <p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto:privacyadmin@allisports.com">privacyadmin@allisports.com</a>, or you may contact us via regular mail at: </p>

  <p><span class="term-title">2. Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities:</span> ALLI may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from ALLI, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by Affiliates for ALLI. The Personal Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name. Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. </p>
  
  <p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
  
  <p>Users that register for ALLI’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from ALLI. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, ALLI, or the Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</strong></p>
  
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><strong>Registration.</strong> To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for ALLI’s wireless marketing services. Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of ALLI depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.<br>
      <br>
	  
      <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
        <li><strong>Single Opt-in Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to ALLI will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to ALLI to send text messages to him or her. ALLI will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from ALLI or by sending a text message to ALLI that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.  </li>
        <li><strong>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to ALLI’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by ALLI) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page. The user must also agree to the Site’s <u>Privacy Policy </u>and <u>Terms of Use Agreement</u> before the online registration process is completed. ALLI will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from ALLI to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of ALLI’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <u>provided that</u> ALLI may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while ALLI continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. </li>
        <li><strong>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. ALLI will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from ALLI to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of ALLI’s wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that ALLI may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while ALLI continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from ALLI by the following procedure: <br>
      <br>
      A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by ALLI at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”. ALLI will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with ALLI. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of ALLI service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in. </li>
    <li><strong>Termination of Wireless Services by ALLI.</strong> A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that ALLI may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. ALLI may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site. </li>
    <li><strong>Use of Information.</strong> ALLI will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share such Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Affiliates.</li>
