		<p>ALLI may provide users and viewers with  the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming  and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as  mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their  consent to receive such information from ALLI, either by  registering on the Site or via their wireless device.&nbsp; Such services and promotional opportunities  are provided by ALLI and/or Affiliates for ALLI.&nbsp; The Information requested as part of the  online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless  email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested for  specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services,  choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.&nbsp; Depending on the Promotion, we may also  collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information  collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this  Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. <strong></strong></p>
		<p>We caution  that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of  an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal  Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
		<p>Users that register for ALLI’s wireless  marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<strong> </strong>be charged by the user’s wireless  carrier for all messages sent to the user from ALLI.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless  noted otherwise.&nbsp; <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, </strong><strong>ALLI</strong><strong> or the Affiliates be responsible for any wireless  email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has  access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
		<ol class="pp-links" type="a">
			<li><strong>Registration.&nbsp; </strong>To the extent we provide wireless  marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for ALLI’s  wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard  rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the  “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of ALLI depending on  the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate  services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
				<ol class="pp-links" type="i">
					<li><strong>Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television,  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a  specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to  register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The  user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to ALLI will mean  that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to ALLI to send  text messages to him or her. ALLI will thank the  user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any  time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from ALLI or by  sending a text message to ALLI that says  “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp; </li>
					<li><strong>Double  Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp;  In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional  messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration  process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively  consent to ALLI’s sending of wireless messages to  his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or  wireless email address, only if requested by ALLI) and by  clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <strong><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></strong> before the online registration process is completed. ALLI will then send  a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will  request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages  from ALLI to that particular telephone number  (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that  states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of ALLI’s wireless  marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user  responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the  specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation”  message at any time <u>provided that</u> ALLI may choose to  terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s  response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while ALLI continues to  offer the specific wireless marketing service.</li>

			<li><strong>Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in  methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive  messages from ALLI by the following procedure:
				<p>A user may cancel one or more  services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe  mechanism provided by ALLI at the time  the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”,  “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp;  ALLI will terminate the user’s  registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word “ALL”  in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered  wireless services with ALLI.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of ALLI  service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated  immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p></li>
			<li><strong>Termination of Wireless Services  by </strong><strong>ALLI.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees  that ALLI may, in its sole discretion and  without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless  marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without  advance notice.&nbsp; ALLI may provide  notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</li>

		Certain Information  collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and  regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s  request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
		If the burden or  expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the  risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated,  we may decide not to provide access to such Information.
