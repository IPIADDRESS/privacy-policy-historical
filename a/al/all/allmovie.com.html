    <h2>Your Information: What We Collect, How We Collect It, and How It Is Used</h2>

    <p>
        In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the
        AMN Properties. Any data we gather through your use of AMN Property falls into three categories: (1)
        personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register
        (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, register your device,
        complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is
        collected as you use AMN Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and
        (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use AMN Property,
        including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a “cookie” (cookies are
        discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on AMN Property.
        Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed,
        interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We
        use this information to better provide products and services, including, without limitation,
        to better target advertising and content, (on our and our Partner's websites) and to generate
        statistics and reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may use certain AMN Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless
        build a history of your interactions with the AMN Property even though we don't know who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
        In respect of certain AMN Properties which are products, AMN may also employ update management
        software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product,
        version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple AMN Properties,
        AMN may combine or link information collected from various AMN Properties and use it for the
        purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

    <h2>Personal information</h2>

    <p>
        As is common across websites, to use certain features of AMN Property we ask you to register, create an
        account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an
        account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in
        your profile).  When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as
        name, address, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in
        order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using
        it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive
        newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or
        to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        AMN may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the AMN Properties. To
        enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so
        that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that
        you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.
    </p>
    <p>
        To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address,
        shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information
        to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use
        it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general
        AMN will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have
        provided these details and you consent to our so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking
        and recommendations.

    <h2>Email</h2>

    <p>
        Email addresses are used for identification, inviting new friends to AMN Properties, searching for and

        searching for and finding friends on the AMN Properties, AMN allows users to search for other members
        using text searches, first and last name, email address, and by using other attributes. Users can
        invite friends to join certain AMN Properties by sending invitation emails via our automated
        invitation system. Where permitted by applicable law, AMN stores these email addresses so that
        the respondents may be added to the friend list of the member sending the invitations and to
        establish relationships between users.
