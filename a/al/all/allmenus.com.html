	       	<h3>Information Collection</h3>
			<p>We collect information volunteered by consumers when they register and place orders on our Web site.  The information we collect through registration and order placement is used to provide the services specified on our Web site.  From time to time, we may solicit additional personal and demographic information, for market research purposes, in the form of surveys or polls. Participation in market research surveys by our customers is entirely optional and at their discretion.  We also store information such as page views, computer IP addresses and other statistics in the form of logs. These logs are used solely to enhance the technical performance of our Web site.</p>
			<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
			<p>In order to process your food order, we must share the following information every time you place an order with a restaurant: your name, delivery address, food order and credit card information (if applicable).  We restrict this information flow to only the bare minimum elements required to prepare and fulfill your orders.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, we may voluntarily share, sell or rent aggregated (non-personal) market research data with 3rd party partners and vendors. This information does not contain personally identifiable information and is shared for the purposes of enhancing our service.	We may present offers to you on behalf of third party partners. If you accept an offer, we will share your name, address and credit card information with this third party.  We will not share this information without your consent.</p>
			<h3>Customer Communication</h3>
			<p>Our customer service representatives may use your telephone number, e-mail address and instant messenger ID to notify you of the status of your order as necessary and appropriate.</p>
			<p>Upon request, we provide Web site visitors with access to transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases or amounts and types of purchases) and contact information (e.g., name, address and phone number) we maintain about them. </p>
			<p>From time to time, we may use the information collected to send special offers on behalf of 3rd party partners or vendors (including restaurants) participating in our service. However, we do not share your information with the restaurant other than the information necessary to conduct business as stated above. </p>
			<h3>E-mail/ Anti-Spam</h3>
			<p>We do not purchase bulk e-mail addresses nor do we use the services of bulk e-mail companies for promoting our service. This means we will not distribute, sell or rent your e-mail address to any third party. Additionally, our e-mail servers do not relay e-mail destined for non-local domains.</p>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>We use "cookies" (small text files stored in your internet browser) to enhance your ordering experience. Cookies allow our users to order faster and more efficiently by storing information such as your campus, order information and personal preferences. We do not use cookies to track your surfing habits and activities outside of our Web site. Cookies can be easily and safely deleted from your system. See you browser's help section for instructions.</p>
			<h3>Security Information</h3>
			<p>We always use industry standard encryption technologies, such as 128 bit SSL encryption, when transferring and receiving private consumer data on our site.  This information can only be translated once it's received by our secure servers. These secure servers help to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you through our Web site.</p>
			<h3>Policy Changes</h3>
			<p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.  If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.  If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should periodically check this section of our Web site.</p>
