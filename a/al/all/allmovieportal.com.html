					<font size="2">
					Last update: February 2004
					<p>This document describes the privacy practices for UGO Networks, Inc. (“UGO”). As part of our commitment to your privacy, the websites maintained by UGO’s contributing editors, affiliates, and business partners post and administer their own privacy policies regarding the use of your information. Please read these policies carefully before taking advantage of their services. </p>
					<p><b>This policy makes clear that UGO could merge with or be acquired by another entity. Should this occur, you should expect that UGO would share some or all of your information with the other entity.</b></p>
					<p><b>Information We Collect Via Log Files And Cookies:</b> UGO collects information about its users in a number of ways. While a user is on the UGO network, we automatically track certain information through log files and, on some pages, through cookies. This information includes a user’s most recent visit, the URL they came from, the URL they visit next, the browser they are using, and their IP address. UGO evaluates this data on an aggregate basis and does not associate the information with a user’s personal identity.</p>
					<p><b>Information Collected by Third-Party Advertisers:</b> We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit UGO. Often, these companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites to track the performance of an ad program. This does not include your name, address, e-mail or telephone number but will include the date and time of your visit, your IP address, the URLs of sites you visit and the banner ad that was shown.</p>
					<p>To stop a third-party advertiser from employing cookies on your computer, you may opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) site. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" title="NAI">Click here for the NAI site.</a> </p>

							<li>ask to receive any of our newsletters; or</li>
							<li>use our Send to a Friend functionality.</li>
						</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p>When providing UGO with information, a user is asked to enter their name and/or email address, and has the option to provide additional information. Their mailing address and demographic information may be required to enter contests.</p>
					<p><b>How We Use the Information We Collect:</b>
						</p><ul>
							<li>to better understand the demographics, interests and behavior of our collective audience </li>
							<li>to deliver advertisements and promotions targeted to our users’ interests </li>
							<li>to deliver prizes </li>
							<li>to deliver promotional information from UGO or its sponsors provided the user opted in for these notifications. </li>
						</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p><b>Who Else Might See The Information We Collect:</b>
						</p><ul>
							<li>Our contributing editors, affiliates or advertisers who have sponsored a promotion or event, provided the user opted in to share their information with these partner(s). </li>
							<li>Our business development partners who provide services such as the UGO Personals, etc., who each maintain their own privacy policies.</li>
							<li>Advertisers and partners using aggregate anonymous data to profile our collective audience.</li>
