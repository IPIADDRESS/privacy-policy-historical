	          <strong>Last updated on January 17, 2012.</strong>
            <p><strong>AllTrails, Inc.</strong> (<em>“AllTrails”</em>, <em>“our”</em>, <em>“us”</em> or <em>“we”</em>) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of <a href="http://alltrails.com">alltrails.com</a> (collectively, the <em>“Site”</em>) and our proprietary and co-branded applications for mobile devices (any and all of the foregoing, the <em>“Application”</em>).  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application.  This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or via the Application.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our AllTrails <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a></p>

            <p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Information Collection and Use</dt>
              <dd>
              <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (together, the <em>“Service”</em>) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application.</p>
              <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.  </strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                <p>In the course of using the Service, we may ask you to provide us with, or grant us access to, or permission to obtain, certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you (“<em>Personal Information</em>”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, pictures of you, your email address, your postal address and your billing information (e.g., credit card number and billing address).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In order to access certain features of the Service, you must register to create an account (<em>"Account"</em>) and become a <em>"Member"</em>.  In connection with registration we will collect Personal Information from you. (See “<em>Information Sharing and Disclosure: Preferred Partners,</em>” below for a description of the circumstances under which we may share information, which may contain your Personal Information, with our partners). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    You may register directly via the Site and Application or by logging into your account with certain third party social networking services (<em>“SNS”</em>) via the Site and Application, as described herein.  If you decide to register through an SNS, we will extract the Personal Information and other information you have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address, profile picture and other information you choose to make publicly available via the applicable SNS) from the account you have with the applicable SNS and use that information to create your Account.  The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS.  We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions and administer your inquiries.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, age, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (<em>“Non-Identifying Information”</em>). For users of the Application, the type of Non-Identifying Information we collect also includes, but is not limited to: (i) mobile device type, device identification code and device properties; (ii) geographical data, including, but not limited to, your country of residence; and (iii) ads you click on within the Application.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other AllTrails Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    We also use your Personal Information to contact you with AllTrails newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or via the “My Account” section of the Site. (See <em>“Changing or Deleting Information,”</em> below.)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Promotions.</strong> From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (collectively, <em>“Promotions”</em>) through the Site and Application. If you decide to participate, we will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these Promotions is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  We use this information to administer your participation in each Promotion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Log Data.</strong> When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an <em>“AllTrails User”</em>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<em>“Log Data”</em>). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (<em>“IP”</em>) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and Service and for the Site and Application’s technical administration, to increase our Site and Application’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors’ needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site and Application again, the Site and Application will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site and Application meet the criteria required to process their requests.

                <p>
                  Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by AllTrails Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser.  Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site and Application or all functionality of the Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also use "web beacons," "pixel tags," "clear GIFs" or similar means (individually or collectively <em>"Web Beacons"</em>) on our Site and Application. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site and Application to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site and Application are used.

                  <p>
                    Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to AllTrails.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

                  As part of the Service, Members may invite non-registered users to use the Service through use of their Accounts.  Where a Member selects the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message such Member creates in the corresponding template will be sent from AllTrails to those email addresses on the Member’s behalf.  These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the communication to the addressee.

                  <strong>AllTrails Members.</strong> We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site and via our Service according to the preferences you set in your Account.  For example, AllTrails Users will see your profile picture, name, location (city and state), the date you first registered via the Service, your Member status and your favorite activities.  AllTrails Users will also see information related to your activities on the Site and Application, including, but not limited to, photos you upload, trails you create or complete, reviews of trails you post and individuals you add as friends and follow via the Service.  If you would like to make the information in your profile private (i.e., not publicly viewable via the Site and Application), you may do so via the “My Profile” section of the Site and Application. Providing your Personal Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with others.  For further information regarding “Submissions” see the AllTrails Terms of Use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Preferred Partners.</strong> We may share the information you provide during registration (e.g., your username, name, email address and zip code) (“Specific Shared Data”) with certain of our partners (“Preferred Partners”) for those parties to use such Specific Shared Data to provide you with information and marketing materials about their own applications, products and services and to further enhance your use of our Service. For example, such data sharing may occur when you use an Application that is co-branded by AllTrails and one or more of our Preferred Partners.  At the time of registration to use the Service, you may have the option to opt out of our sharing Specific Shared Data, with the applicable Preferred Partner.  We only share Specific Shared Data with our Preferred Partners pursuant to an agreement under which the Preferred Partner is obligated to maintain and use the Specific Shared Data it receives solely for the purposes for which it was provided to the partner or in compliance with applicable law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Preferred Partner’s privacy policy is surfaced to you in connection with the registration process, the Preferred Partner’s privacy policy will also apply to the use of your Specific Shared Data by the Preferred Partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>SNSs.</strong> The Service gives you the option to share information contained in your Account with certain SNSs (including but not limited to Twitter and Facebook).  AllTrails will not share your Account information, which may contain your Personal Identifiable Information, with such SNSs unless you expressly authorize such disclosure.
