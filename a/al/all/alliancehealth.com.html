        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Other information</h4>
        <p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information may include:</p>
        <p>
          <u>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data:</u>
        </p>
        <p>We may use this information in the administration of this site, diagnose problems with our server, to improve site usability, to analyze trends, to track users' movement around the site, and to gather Demographic Information (definition below) about our user base as a whole.</p>
        <p>
          <u>Click-through URL:</u>
        </p>
        <p>In some of our email messages we use a click-through URL linked to content on our site.  When visitors click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page.  We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications.  If you prefer to avoid this type of tracking; avoid clicking text or graphic links on the site or in site related emails.</p>
        <p>
          <u>Pixel tags:</u>
        </p>
        <p>Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that tell us what parts of our site visitors have visited.  This allows us to measure the effectiveness of searches visitors perform on our site.  Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format consumers can read.  Pixel tags also allow us to determine whether emails have been opened, thereby ensuring that we're sending only messages that are of interest to consumers.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to consumers.</p>
        <p>
          <u>Web Beacons:</u>
        </p>
        <p>We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personal information.</p>
        <h4>Demographic Information</h4>
        <p>Based on our collection of your geographic location such as a submitted zip code or your IP address, we may extrapolate demographic characteristics about you. This data is not unique to you but refers to selected population characteristics, based on your geo-location and may include, age, preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history, interests and favorites.</p>
        <h4>Behavioral Information</h4>
        <p>Behavioral information, individual and aggregate, is about individuals' online activity over a period of time to determine potential future behaviors or interests. We use behavioral information in aggregate to improve your web experience including presenting content and offers that may be most relevant to you based on previous online actions.</p>
        <p>This information can include information regarding how visitors use our sites, the areas of the sites that are visited, what services are accessed, and information about your computer hardware and software, geolocation, browser, operating system type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses.</p>
        <p>Some of this information is necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services.</p>
        <h4>Cookie Information</h4>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file stored by a web site on your computer to track information.  It is important to know that there are many types of cookies.

As you interact within the community site, you may post User Content. You do this at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access by other site visitors to your profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may (1.) choose to share your pages, and (2.) directly provide Personally Identifiable Information and personal information to. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.</p>
        <p>Personally Identifiable Information, personal information, and other information you post in public areas of the site becomes User Content and can, in some instances, be edited but not everything posted can be. We ask that you provide references for any medical information posted which isn't your own personal experience (something you have personally undergone). User Content you post will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world, including countries that might not have legislation that guarantees adequate protection with respect to your country of residence. By providing User Content for inclusion in our database, you acknowledge that you consent to your User Content being used as described herein. While Alliance Health takes measures to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third parties, Alliance Health does not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of User Content you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Alliance Health sites. Accordingly, you should ensure that you do not post Personally Identifiable Information or sensitive personal information in a public area of any Alliance Health site or alternatively use tools that we provide like anonymous Connect posting or offer privacy solutions featured in the user profile.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information relevant to the invitation process, such as your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this email communication or your any information you provide about your friend.</p>
        <h2 id="rights">Your Rights As a User; Access/Choice</h2>
        <p>You control which (if any) of the details of your membership profile can be viewed by other members of the community.</p>
        <h4>Accessing/Updating Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
        <p>If at any time your Personally Identifiable Information changes, you may correct, update, or amend it by logging in and editing your profile's information in the "About Me" tab. If you no longer desire our service, submit your request to <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a>; which will ensure the complete removal of the Personally Identifiable Information within our community websites as well as removal from our email databases. If at any time you wish to withdraw your consent to having your Personally Identifiable Information used or disclosed to third parties please contact us at <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a> and we will remove you immediately.</p>
        <h4>Data Retention</h4>
        <p>We will retain your Personally Identifiable Information as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide you services, or until you opt-out.  However, we may retain certain data you provided as we deem necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.  Alliance Health disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention of information.  Alliance Health does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain information that has since been removed from Alliance Health's publicly viewable database.</p>
        <h4>Choice / Opt-Out</h4>

        <h2 id="partners">Our Advertising Partners and Our Relationships to Other Companies</h2>
        <p>In our effort to empower consumers and help enable a more consumer-centric healthcare industry, we are committed to providing a free and independent service. As a result our site may contain information, links to other sites and advertisements of healthcare services and partners that may help you make educated healthcare choices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites but encourage you to evaluate their specific commitment to you.</p>
        <p>Certain products and services marketed through the site are made available by the trusted partner companies of Alliance Health with which we have a strategic alliance. To obtain these products and services you may be required to visit another company's website or a site they share with the site. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with Alliance Health. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner providing the goods or services will apply.</p>
        <p>We urge you to read and understand our partners' policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. Alliance Health, however, cannot control the way these partners collect or use information.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about our partners' privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly.</p>
        <p>All Alliance Health offers are subject to participation by the advertising partner, product availability, and any applicable state or federal laws that govern such offers. Any offers shown are reasonable facsimiles, and participating advertising partners reserve the right to withdraw offers, substitute another product, or modify offers at their sole discretion.</p>
        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>We use a secure, respected hosting provider for all of our sites, which are housed in a SAS 70 TYPE II certified data center.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We also use firewalls and other access controls on our servers that are monitored to help protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When Personally Identifiable Information is entered or displayed on registration forms and pages, we encrypt that information.  We exclusively use 2048 bit SSL certificates.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each and every one of our employees servicing our sites are obligated to abide by the Privacy Policy.  Only authorized employees servicing our sites are permitted to have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, and such access is limited by need.</p>
        <p>Since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Alliance Health.  There is no guarantee that the information may not be accessed, copied, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
        <p>
          Any improper collection or misuse by unauthorized third parties of Personally Identifiable Information, or other information provided on the site is a violation of the terms of use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:community@alliancehealth.com">community@alliancehealth.com</a>.
