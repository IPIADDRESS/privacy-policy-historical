        We make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we 
        ask you for personal information. Below are more details about the information 
        Alloy.com gathers from you and how we use it: 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Cookies</b>. We try to provide you with services, products and offers 
        customized to your interests. In order to do that, we use "cookies" to 
        keep and sometimes track information about you. A "cookie" is a small 
        piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored 
        on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to: access your account 
        information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more 
        personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; 
        assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of 
        entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which 
        areas of our site you have visited. We may also match information obtained 
        from cookies with data provided by you or collected by third parties. 
        We analyze this data both in the aggregate (like, half of our users are 
        guys) and in connection with individual users (like, Joe Cool visits Alloy 
        Sports the most). This information lets us give you the services you want 
        that are connected with your interests. We also provide the analysis of 
        our users (as a group, of course) to prospective partners, advertisers 
        and other third parties. 
      </p><p> <img src="/images/shim.gif" width="25" height="1">You can opt to have 
        your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you'll need to re-register 
        with Alloy every time you visit our site in order to participate in certain 
        promotions and other stuff. You should also know that companies that advertise 
        on our site may use their own cookies. This privacy policy does not cover 
        how these companies use their cookies. <br>
        <br>
      </p><p> <b>Alloy Surveys and Polls</b>. In order to gather information about 
        our audience, Alloy conducts surveys and polls of our users from time 
        to time. These surveys and polls are sometimes asked on behalf of a particular 
        client, sometimes for a bunch of clients, or sometimes just for fun. Any 
        data we collect from the survey is edited before we release it to a client. 
        We may be paid for some or all of this survey data. All surveys are optional 
        and any prizes offered for participating in an Alloy Survey are awarded 
        based on a random drawing.
      </p><p> When you participate in a survey, you are completely anonymous. Your 
        answers are immediately separated from your personal information. We only 
        ask for name and email in order to award random prizes. If you do give 
        us your name or e-mail address in some section of the form where it wasn't 
        supposed to be included, we will delete it before releasing the data outside 
        Alloy.com.
      </p><p> The survey reports we send out to clients will include aggregated data, 
        like 80% of the boys said X and 64% of the girls said Y. If we ask you 
        for a zip code it is only so that we can compare likes and dislikes and 
        attitudes from all different parts of our Alloy.com membership. We will 
        not participate in any survey initiative on behalf of a client which will 
        not protect your privacy.
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Promotions</b>. We may ask you for personally identifiable information 
        at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter sweepstakes, 
        contests or promotions sponsored by us or a third party. If you don't 
        want your information collected by us or these third parties, you can 
        decide not to participate in the promotion, contest or sweepstakes. 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        E-zine</b> Alloy offers a weekly ezine to its users. Only users age 13 
        or older are allowed to subscribe to the ezine. On occasion, we disclose 
        the email addresses of our ezine subscribers to a contractor in order 
        to deliver our ezine. If you want to update your email address or stop 
        receiving the newsletter, follow the procedures to unsubscribe at the 
        bottom of any ezine we send you or contact us at <a href="mailto:myinfo@alloy.com">myinfo@alloymail.com.</a> 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Other Third Parties</b>. Alloy.com may share non-personal, aggregate, 
        or summary, information regarding our users with other third parties not 
        mentioned in this policy. This kind of information does not identify you 
        individually. 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Legal Authorities</b>. We may disclose user information to government 
        authorities at our discretion. We also may disclose user information when 
        we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference 
        with our rights or property, other Alloy users, or anyone else that could 
        be harmed by such activities. 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Business Transfer</b>. In the event that Alloy Online, Inc. or substantially 
        all of its assets are acquired by a third party, customer information 
        will be one of the transferred assets. 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        OTHER ALLOY SERVICES</b> 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Chat Rooms, Voice Chat and Message Boards</b>. You must be age 13 or older 
        to use the Alloy chat rooms, voice chat and message boards. Although Alloy 
        reserves the right to monitor Chat Rooms, Voice Chat sessions, and Message 
        Boards we will not be able to do so all of the time. <b><br>
        <br>
        REMEMBER - DO NOT DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, THROUGH 
        VOICE CHAT OR ON MESSAGE BOARDS. WHENEVER YOU DO SO, ALL OF THAT INFORMATION 
        CAN BE COLLECTED AND USED BY OTHERS. IF YOU POST PERSONAL INFO IN PUBLIC 
        PLACES, OTHERS MAY SEND YOU UNSOLICITED E-MAIL MESSAGES. BE CAREFUL AND 
        BE SMART WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b> 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        Alloy Auctions</b>. In order to participate in Alloy Auctions, you will 
        be providing personal information to third parties. That information includes 
        any information you provide to us or other users during the registration, 
        bidding or listing process, in any public message area (including the 
        feedback area) or through any email feature. When you are participating 
        in Alloy Auctions, you are solely responsible for personal information, 
        and we act as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication 
        of all of this personal information. You are asked for this information 
        only for the purposes of participating in the auction, so that the seller 
        can send you whatever it is that you purchased online. But, Sellers participating 
        in Alloy Auctions could be individual people or other businesses - all 
        third parties unrelated to Alloy - and we don't have any idea what they 
        might do with your personal information once it's given to them for the 
        purpose of getting the stuff that you're paying them for. <b><br>

        REMEMBER, YOU ARE PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION HERE TO TOTAL STRANGERS 
        - INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER BUSINESSES. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE 
        USES OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON ALLOY AUCTIONS, AND YOU 
        SHOULDN'T DO SO WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING WITH YOUR PARENTS</b>. 
      </p><p> <b><br>
        ACCESS TO OTHER SITES THROUGH ALLOY.COM</b>

        opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by Alloy.com. 
        These sites, some of whom are Alloy.com advertisers, may collect personally 
        identifiable information about you. Alloy.com does not control sites that

        of these sites and this privacy statement does not address the information

        SECURITY</b>
