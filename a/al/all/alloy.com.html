<h2>PRIVACY POLICY </h2>
<p>
Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.alloy.com/">www.alloy.com</a> ("the Site")!  The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform users of the Site as to what information we collect and how and why we use such information.

</p><p><strong>
Disclosure Regarding Collection and Use of Personal Information.</strong>
</p><p>
Through use of the Site, users may enter personal information about themselves. This policy explains our online information collection and use practices and the choices you can make about the way we use and share such information. Please take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can understand how we use your personal information. 
</p><p>
OUR ONLINE INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE PRACTICES MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PRACTICES REGARDING INFORMATION OBTAINED OFFLINE. 
</p><p>
REMEMBER IF YOU MAKE USE OF THE SITE, REGISTER WITH THE SITE, REQUEST INFORMATION THAT THE SITE MAY OFFER, PARTICIPATE IN A SURVEY, PURCHASE SOMETHING THROUGH THE SITE, REQUEST A CATALOG, ENTER ANY OF OUR CONTESTS OR PROMOTIONS OR SUBMIT INFORMATION IN ANY WAY TO OR THROUGH THR SITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS. AS WE UPDATE AND EXPAND OUR SERVICES, THIS POLICY MIGHT CHANGE, SO REVIEW IT FROM TIME TO TIME. 

</p><p><strong>
The Information We Collect.</strong>
</p><p>
You can do a variety of things on the Site! You may be able to order products, enter contests, participate in surveys, vote in polls, subscribe to a service (like our ezine) or participate in a chat room. We may collect personal information (i.e. information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted, including: name, address, age, date of birth, sex, grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs and services) through these methods or other documents that you submit to us, transactions in which you may engage with us or our affiliated companies, or through visits that you may make to the Site. This policy applies to all personal information that we collect and maintain about our users, including any contact information (e.g., name and address), financial information (e.g., account and credit history) or identifying information (e.g., social security number, date of birth) that we may obtain in connection with providing services. You can view, update or change your information at any time. <a href="http://www.alloy.com/profile/manager/">Click here</a> to edit your profile or send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@alloy.com">unsubscribe@alloy.com</a>.
</p><p>
Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail address, sex and telephone number. 

</p><p><strong>
Other Collected Information</strong>
</p><p>
We also may collect certain non-personal information (i.e. generic information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows '98 or Mac OS), the IP address you are using to connect to the Site and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or EarthLink). 

</p><p><strong>
How We Use Your Personal Information.</strong> 
</p><p>
We will use the personal information you provide online for the purpose(s) you have submitted. Examples of us using your personal information for the purpose(s) submitted include if you order a catalog, we will send to you a catalog in the mail or, if you have won a contest, sending to you an email notification that you have won.  In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey. For example, we may send to you an e-mail regarding special merchandise offers and announcements about products or services we offer. We may also contact you offline.  For example, when you provide your mailing address, we may send to you in the mail special offers, promotions and catalogs, which we think may be of interest to you. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail).  However, for shop customers only, we will seek to obtain your consent when we collect your personal information for the first time so that if you are a repeat customer, we will apply the preferences you selected the first time you "checked out".  If you want us to stop using the personal information you provided in these ways, please go to <a href="http://www.alloy.com/profile/manager/">Edit My Profile</a> on the Site or contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@alloy.com">unsubscribe@alloy.com</a>.

</p><p><strong>
How We Share Your Personal Information.</strong> 
</p><p>
We will not share with third parties the personal information you provide except (a) if it is for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); (d) with other persons, service providers or companies with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or our business activities (for example, sending out a product or a promotional item that you have requested on the Site); and/or (e) notifying you when we make material changes to one of our subscriber agreements or this policy. Examples of us sharing your personal information for the purposes submitted are if you participate in a third-party survey, enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third-party or request information from a third-party, we may provide the information provided to a third party so that they can send to you directly the information you requested. We will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail).  However, for shop customers only, we will seek to obtain your consent when we collect your personal information for the first time so that if you are a repeat customer, we will apply the preferences you selected the first time you "checked out". 
</p><p>
Additionally, with your consent, we may share the personal information you provide online with companies not affiliated with us (i.e. third party companies) who are interested in marketing their products or services to you or in asking you questions, both online and offline. We will seek to obtain your consent either by an "opt-in" or "opt-out" method, or by other means (such as sending to you an e-mail). Companies with whom we might share your personal information may include consumer products, telecom, financial, military, market research, entertainment, and educational services companies and their third party service providers. If you want us to stop sharing your personal information with these companies, please go to <a href="http://www.alloy.com/profile/manager/">Edit My Profile</a> on the Site or contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@alloy.com">unsubscribe@alloy.com</a>.
</p><p>
If you would like to opt-out of receiving offline communications from us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@alloy.com">unsubscribe@alloy.com</a> or let us know in writing via letter addressed to:  Attn: Privacy Alloy Media, LLC 151 W. 26th Street, 11th Floor New York, NY 10001.  For all postal mail opt-out requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.  We cannot accept postal mail opt-out requests via telephone or facsimile, nor will we be responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly or lack complete information. Please note that we may require up to sixty (60) days to fully remove your postal mail information from our mailings. 
</p><p>
If you consent to receiving communications from non-affiliated companies, you may need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications or if you wish to change any data you provided online. In this instance, any changes or amendments to your personal information must be given directly to each company who communicates with you as these changes, amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged between us and non-affiliated companies.
</p><p>
If we do share personal information with a non-affiliated company, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these non-affiliated companies will use your personal information.
</p><p>
Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our affiliates, may continue to contact you via email or postal mail for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or sweepstakes you have participated in or have entered, goods, services or products you have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken on the Site.

</p><p><strong>
Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Information.</strong>
</p><p>
We sometimes use the non-personal information that we collect to improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze how the Site is used, as well as to offer you products, programs or services. Sometimes we share aggregate information with others, including affiliated companies and non-affiliated companies.
</p><p>
We may also allow third-party companies to serve advertisements and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit the Site. Such companies may use non-personal information (e.g.: click stream information, browser type (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox), time and date and/or subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Site and other websites in order to make available advertisements about goods and services that such information indicates would likely be of greater interest to you.  Such companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacons to collect this type of non-personal information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or how you may opt-out of these types of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. 
</p><p>
If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@alloy.com">CLICKING HERE</a> to: (i) deregister your account; or (ii) change or edit your preferences.  You may also use the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an email. 

</p><p><strong>
Collection of Information By Others.</strong>
</p><p>
The Site may contain links to other websites, including links that are placed there by us, such as third-party advertisements or text hyperlinks.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all users of the Site to be aware of when they leave the Site, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personal information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by the Site, through the Site.
</p><p>
We may offer additional e-mail services or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personal information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies. 

</p><p><strong>
Cookies.</strong>
</p><p>
To enhance your online experience with us, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files placed on your hard disk by our web server to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to provide the personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
</p><p>
We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how the Site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on subsequent visits (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to the Site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies. If you do that, you may need to re-register with us every time you visit the Site in order to participate in certain functions of the Site. You should also know that companies that advertise on the Site (and their agents) might use their own cookies. This policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. 

</p><p><strong>
Clickstream Data.</strong>
</p><p>
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "Clickstream Data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream Data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may use Clickstream Data as a form of non-personal information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve the Site. Any collection or use of Clickstream Data will be anonymous and aggregate. 

</p><p><strong>
Supplementing Information.</strong>
</p><p>
From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources. 

</p><p><strong>
Discussions and Community Tools.</strong>
</p><p>
We may, from time to time, make review lists, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, newsgroups and other community tools available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use. For example, from time to time, we may use the content you write (including your name or screen name if you post it) for promotional purposes, in e-mail newsletters or elsewhere, and by using the Site and/or these chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and other community tools, you agree that we may do so. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone - not just us - may access your publicly posted information. 

</p><p><strong>
Our Commitment to Security.</strong>
</p><p>
We believe we have in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online. Whenever personal information is passed on to non-affiliated companies, to the extent practical, we require that they also have in place the appropriate safeguards. We cannot, however, guarantee that they do so.
