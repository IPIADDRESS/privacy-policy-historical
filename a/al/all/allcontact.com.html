      <p> <strong>PRIVACY  POLICY</strong><strong><br>
          (Last  Revised: 28-NOV-2011)</strong><br>
          <br>
        Thank  you for visiting this web site. We understand the importance that  Internet users place on privacy, and this Privacy Policy describes  how we use personal information that is collected at this web site.  Please read this Privacy Policy before using this site or submitting  any personal information. By using this web site, you accept the  privacy practices contained in this Privacy Policy. These privacy  practices may change from time to time, but any changes will be  posted. You are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy whenever you  visit the web site to make sure you understand how any personal  information you provide will be used.<br>
        <strong>Information  We Collect</strong><br>
        In  order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable  information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses,  and sometimes credit card information when such information is  voluntarily submitted by our visitors. We may use your personal  information, transfer your personal information, and/or sell your  personal information for any legal purpose, including, without  limitation: (1) to deliver the products and/or services to you that  you have requested; (2) to validate your compliance with the terms  and conditions; (3) for content improvement and feedback purposes;  (4) to reach you, when necessary, regarding your use of the web site  or product(s); and (5) to bring retail opportunities and promotional  offers to you by email, direct mail, telemarketing, and/or online  banner advertising. When your information is provided to third  parties, these third parties may include providers of direct  marketing services and applications. We or these third parties may  supplement the information we collect online with outside records to  enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you,  and/or to offer you targeted advertising and other opportunities to  purchase products and services that we believe may be of interest to  you.<br>
        We  will NEVER share your credit card information with third parties  unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in  order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us.  By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to  receive free information on products and services that may be of  interest to you. You also enable us to personalize your experience  with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of  service. By submitting your email address on this web site, you agree  to receive email from us and our third party advertisers. We, and our  third party advertisers, may maintain separate email lists for  different purposes. You can cancel your participation in any of these  email lists at any time by clicking the opt-out link or other  unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only  send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either  directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited  commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.<br>
        In  addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web  site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered  herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an  application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule  (ATSR), 16 CFR ‘310 et seq. and any applicable state and local “do  not call” regulations. We and our third party advertisers retain  the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the  ATSR and the applicable state regulations. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Third  Party Actions<br>
        </strong>We  do not control and are not liable for the actions of our third party  marketers or advertisers. We pride ourselves in working with quality  companies, but have no control over the actions of those third  parties. While we are not liable for any of the actions of those  third parties, you should feel free to give us feedback from time to  time on your experiences with any third parties to whom we work with  so that we may enhance our future service to all  customers.<br>
        <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
        We  may use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your  interests. Cookies are text files that are used by your computer’s  web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your  user experience with our web site. <br>
        <strong>IP  Addresses<br>
        </strong>We  may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose  problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information,  and to offer you products and services.<br>
        <strong>Third  Party Web Sites</strong><br>
        This  web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may  direct you to web sites that are owned and/or controlled by third  parties. We have no control over those third parties and are not  responsible for the content or the privacy practices of those sites  or companies.<br>
        <strong>Commitment  to Data Security</strong><br>
        All  information collected from you is stored in a technically and  physically secure environment. We use SSL encryption to protect  sensitive information online, and we do everything we can to protect  user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we  take reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of the information that you transmit  to us, and you do so at your own risk.<br>
        <strong>Spam</strong><br>
        If  we determine that you are using allContact to elicit spam email, or  we believe you do not in compliance with the CanSpamAct2003, we  reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.<br>
        We  may also pursue legal action against you to cover any costs incurred  in relation to the disruption of service the spam may have impacted  on allContact.<br>
        We  investigate all spam incidents thoroughly before making any final  decisions. If you believe you have received spam from an allContact  user, please forward the email you received to us at  staff@allcontact.com.<br>
        <strong>Contacting  Us</strong><br>
        If  you need to contact us, you can email us at  staff@allcontact.com.<br>
        <br>
    We  strive to provide excellent products, along with equally excellent  customer service. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy  or our practices, please feel free to contact us using one of the  methods listed above.</p></td>
