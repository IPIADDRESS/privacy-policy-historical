<div style="font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 2px;">1) Company Policy</div>
<div>The privacy of your nonpublic personal information is important to us. We 
use safeguards to protect your privacy and confidentiality. This Disclosure 
discusses information we collect and the manner in which it is used. 
<br><br>
We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update or modify our privacy 
policy simply by posting such change, update or modification on the Website. Any 
such change, update or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on 
the Website.
</div>

<div style="font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 2px;">3) Information Collecting</div>
<div>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Website and read 
the information contained on the Web pages, we may gather certain information about 
your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We may 
automatically gather the Internet domain, IP address from which you access our 
Website, and the date and time you access our Website and the pages you visit. 
<br><br>
We may collect nonpublic personal information from you when you voluntarily provide 
personally identifiable information to us though our Website, such as when subscribing 
to the Allfreethings.com newsletter. We limit use of such information to the purposes 
for which the information was provided. However, we reserve the right to use such 
information to contact you regarding additional services or products that you may find 
useful. This would typically be in the form of an electronic mail (e-mail) message that 
includes advertisements for a product or service from our sponsors.
<br><br>
If you send an e-mail message that includes personally identifiable information, for 
example, in an e-mail message containing an inquiry, we will use that information to 
respond to your inquiry. Remember that e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception.
<br><br>
It is our policy to not sell, rent, or give away any nonpublic personal 
information unless required by law. WE DO NOT DISCLOSE ANY NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION 
ABOUT YOU WITH ANYONE FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY PERMITTED BY LAW. 
<br><br>
We may use "cookies" to improve our service to you. Cookies may help us recall a previous 
visit. The cookies we use do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not 
use them to determine your identity. If you are not comfortable with this use, you may 
configure your browser to be notified when cookies are to be received and to provide you with 
the option of refusing cookies. However, refusing cookies may limit your ability to use our 
Website in its entirety. Our advertisers and sponsors may use cookies as well, but 
Allfreethings.com does not have access to any of this information and is not responsible for 
it's usage.
