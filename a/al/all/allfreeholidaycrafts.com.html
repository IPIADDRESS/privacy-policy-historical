    <p>Prime Publishing and/or certain third parties may collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (<b>"OBA"</b>) purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels. OBA is also referred to as interest-based advertising.</p>
    <p>Prime Publishing displays ads on both the Services and on the Channels. We may use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA. For example, if you read an article about a particular subject on the Services, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.</p>
    <p><strong>The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change.</strong> Prime Publishing allows firms including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liveramp.com/">LiveRamp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datonics.com/">Datonics</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.magnetic.com/">Magnetic</a> to monitor Company web sites and newsletters for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisements, "click-throughs" and/or other activities. These firms may use cookies, web beacons and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about Company users.  Users may go to each firm's site/URL for information on what is being tracked.

If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>
    <p>Push Notifications. We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
