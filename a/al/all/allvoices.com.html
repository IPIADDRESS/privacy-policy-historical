            certain information about a users’ visit to the Website that does not identify the user’s
            individual identity. Similar to other websites, allvoices uses standard web measurements and tracking
            technologies like "cookies", web servers logs, or other statistics programs, which keep records of traffic
            on allvoices websites. This data is generally anonymous information that does not personally identify a
            user, e.g., "clickstream data", such as domain name of the site providing the user with internet access,
            the IP (Internet Protocol) address used to connect the users computer to the Internet, browser type and
            version, type of operating system and platform the user uses, the average user session length, the number

    </ol>
