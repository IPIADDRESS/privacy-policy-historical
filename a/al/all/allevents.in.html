<p>

    If you are a consumer or an event attendee or someone who uses AllEvents.in to discover events and get tailored event recommendations or if you login on our website, we collect additional data from your end such as your name and contact information. This additional data is mostly used for our own purposes.

The period of 6 months is taken into consideration to solve payment or registration related disputes if it happens. As a consumer, when you fill an event inquiry form or enter a coupon code or buy tickets or contact the organizer through our system, your contact details are shared with the organizer to help organizer identify you and reach you for any communication related to that event or for their upcoming events. When you interact with organizers/users through our chat feature or through our chat plugin on any website, you will be introduced to organizer with your email id to better connect with you and provide you with the service/support that you were expecting from them.
</p>
<p>

    If you are receiving event invitations emails for a particular event using our email invitation platform from an organizer, we will notify you in the email that it is being sent by the organizer using our service and we do not store that data in our system. You can at any point unsubscribe directly from such mails or contact the organizer directly to delete your data. If you contact us, we may remove or update your information within a reasonable time.

At any point you can change settings for the type of communication you want or do not want to receive. 
</p>
<p>
Unsubscribing from marketing or service related communication emails does not mean that you may not receive weekly newsletter or event updates for which you opted in or based on the organizer profiles or city you follow or showed your interest at the time of signing up on AllEvents.in. If you never want to receive any emails from us or want to delete your preferences &amp; profile, you can raise your concern on <a href="mailto:privacy@allevents.in">privacy@allevents.in</a>.
