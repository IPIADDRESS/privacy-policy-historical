         <p>We collect all user's age, User Name, Password and Parent's Email address. A child's participation or access to an activity
             is not conditioned on him/her providing more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. We collect
             Parent's Email address to provide Direct Notice.  The parent or guardian will receive an e-mail notifying them that the
             identified child wishes to register on <u>www.SparkCityWorld.com </u> The parent or legal guardian will then be required to
             follow the directions in such notification in order to activate the kid's registration.</p>

          <p>In the event that we change our policy with respect to the collection of personal information from kids, or if new features,
              contests or sweepstakes which a kid wishes to use or participate in require the provision of personal information, their
              parent or guardian will be notified and will be required to give their consent to the collection and use of such information
              and/or be given the option to opt out of participation.</p>

          <p>
              We do allow Parent/Guardians to purchase a VIP membership that will allow their child unlimited access
              to all that Spark City has to offer, this includes: clothing, pets, private/VIP areas, furniture, special
              events and more.
          </p>

          <p>
              A Parent/Guardian is able to consent to the site's use of the child's Personal Information without having also to consent to
              the site's disclosure of the child's Personal Information to third parties.
