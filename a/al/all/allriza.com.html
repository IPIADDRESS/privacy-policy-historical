After you have registered your e-mail address on the Site and if you have clicked 'Remember Me' or signed in to the Site, Eimhir Ltd collects Site behavior and browser information as you navigate through the Site.

During registration a User is required to provide basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User may be required to provide other information associated with the use of that particular feature.
