<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="3"><b>All Time Favorites Online
Privacy Policy</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The All Time
Favorites (ATF) system is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust,
and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal
information you provide online.</font></p>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="3"><b>Basic Confidentiality Policy</b></font><br>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
It is ATF policy that <b>personal information</b>, such as your name, postal and
e-mail address or telephone number, is <b>private and confidential</b>.
Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure
location, is accessible <i>only</i> by designated staff, and is used <i>only</i>
for the purposes for which you provide the information.<i>If</i> you also
indicate on our sites that <i>you would like to receive information about other ATF
programs and services</i>, such as publications, networking groups, or
memberships, your personal information will be added to appropriate ATF mailing
lists. You can indicate your desire when completing a information forms or when
you send us e-mail. If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or
remove your name from the ATF's mailing list, or correct your personal
information, please email us at <a href="mailto:MailList@alltimefavorites.com">MailList@alltimefavorites.com</a></font>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="3"><b>No Release of Information
to Third Parties</b></font><br>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
Personal information <b>will not be released to third parties</b> <i>except</i>
to further the purpose for which you provide the information, such as requesting
information from vendors or if release is required by law or is pertinent to
judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings. <i>There are no other
circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal information to third
parties.</i></font>
</p><p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="3"><b>No Computer Tracking of
Identifiable Information</b></font><br>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information
about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not
e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our
visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our
visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites.
This information is used only for internal purposes by ATF technical support
staff.</font>
</p><p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Our computer also recognizes
what sites you click on during your visit to our website. We cannot identify the
visitor or the visitor's address. Site information is used to improve our
website and may be used to advise vendors and potential vendors of the numbers
of visitors who come to our site from their sites. No personal information is
collected.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">In addition, our web sites
track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile
statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily
requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries
those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to
better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but
again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to
gather such information.</font></p>
