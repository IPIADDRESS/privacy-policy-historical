          Technologies:</b>
        We use various technologies to collect information, and this may
        include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are
        small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that
        help us to improve our Services and your experience, see which areas

        In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is
        in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or
        as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
      </li> <li>

    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Data Security</h4> <p>
      We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
      personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
      unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to
      your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other
      third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
      your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
      confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any
      suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
      regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Data Retention</h4> <p>
      We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
      fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
      satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To
      determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
      consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the
      potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
      personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
      whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
      applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may fully
      anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated
      with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use
      this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Social Sharing Features</h4> <p>
      Our Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated
      tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions
      you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of
      such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or
      the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that
      provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the
      purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with
      social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the
      entities that provide these features.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Analytics Services Provided By Others</h4> <p>
      We may allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf. These
      entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect
      information about your use of our Services and other websites, including
      your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links
      clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by
      Algorithmia and others to, among other things, analyze and track data,
      determine the popularity of certain content, deliver content targeted to
      your interests and better understand your online activity.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h3 class="syn-mb-8">Your Choices</h3> <h4 class="syn-mb-8">Account Information</h4> <p>
      You may update, correct or delete information about you at any time by
      logging into your online account. If you wish to delete your account,
      please email us at
      <a href="mailto:support@algorithmia.com">support@algorithmia.com</a>,
      but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or
      for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or archived
      copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Cookies</h4> <p>
      Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
      you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser
      cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies,
      this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Promotional Communications</h4> <p>
      You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Algorithmia
      by following the instructions in those communications or by visiting
      <a href="/optout">https://www.algorithmia.com/optout</a>. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications,
      such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Access, Erasure and Correction</h4> <p>
      The laws in the European Economic Area and certain jurisdictions outside
      the United States, require us to provide users (to the extent those laws
      apply to such users) with information related to access, erasure and
      correction. Upon request Algorithmia will provide you with information
      about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you would
      like to review, delete or update your information, you may contact us
      using the contact information below. We will permit you to correct,
      amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate. We
      will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Please note,
      because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete or
      amend your information, residual copies may take a period of time before
      they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup
      systems. You will need to provide sufficient identifying information,
      such as your name and email address and possible additional identifying
      information as a security precaution.
    </p></div> <div class="syn-mb-32"><h4 class="syn-mb-8">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4> <p>
      We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes,
      we will notify you by revising the date at the bottom of the policy and,
      in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding
      a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage
      you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access our Services to
      stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help
      protect your privacy.
