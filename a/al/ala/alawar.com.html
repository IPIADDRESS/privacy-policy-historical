In connection with other activities, such as subscribing to the services offered on the Website, subscribing to periodic newsletters sent by Alawar, requesting customer support, downloading trial versions of software, utilizing online software applications or purchasing any of the products and services available on the Website, Alawar may ask you to voluntarily supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.  It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities and/or make any purchases.  If you elect to engage in these activities or make purchases, however, Alawar may ask that you provide us personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, and other personal information.  This information is requested in conjunction with the purchase and registration of our Products or Services.  In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to our newsletter service.
</p><p>
You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.
</p><p>
Alawar is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website.  Alawar will only share your information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our Website.
</p><p>
When you use the Website, Alawar or third parties authorized by Alawar may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to Alawar every time you access content on one of our internet domains within the Website.  Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site.  All of this information may be collected by Alawar and used to help improve our offerings to you.
</p><p>
We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services.  Alawar also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website.  Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.
</p><p>
When you place an order for software or services online, you may be re-directed to a third-party Website.  Any third-party company administers its own Privacy Policy that is not under the control of Alawar.  Prior to placing an online order, please review the Privacy Policy on that Website.  
</p><p>
Credit Card information is not retained as part of the registration process.  This information is processed during the purchase process and is then immediately destroyed.  You are provided an opportunity on the Alawar Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter.  This newsletter is a marketing tool that allows Alawar to inform you of new Products and Services, as well as other news relevant to the company.  The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address.  Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent.  You are given the opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.
</p><p>
[<b><i>While the subscription list is maintained by a trusted third party affiliate, the list remains the sole exclusive property of Alawar.  Your name and email address is not shared with any third party and will not be used to send you unsolicited communications.  A link is provided to allow you to change your subscription preferences, including cancellation of your subscription.</i></b>]
</p><p>
When you submit personal information to Alawar through this Website, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Alawar and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices.  You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Alawar.  Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.  
</p><p>
Alawar may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website.  Typically, these providers would offer services that Alawar customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Alawar services and products.  In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers.  Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's Website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy.  You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Alawar personal information collected from you.  In such instances, Alawar may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>
<b>Information for Affiliates and Software Developers </b>
</p><p>
From time to time, companies or individuals who develop software may access this Website in an effort to enter into a business relationship with Alawar.  In addition, owners of third-party websites may access this Website in an effort to affiliate with Alawar.  Contact information for this purpose is posted on our Website.  For these individuals and entities, in addition to information related to your business, Alawar reserves the right to request personal information including but not limited to your full name, physical address, email address, telephone contact number, employer, etc.  This information will normally be requested only in those situations where you are not contacting Alawar in the capacity of an agent or representative of an established business, and only in those circumstances where the information is required in order to consummate a business relationship.  You may elect not to provide personal identifying information.  However, failure to provide the requested information may hinder Alawar's ability to do business with you.    
</p><p>
<b>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Preferences</b>
</p><p>
You may access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences (such as whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Alawar or third parties) by writing Alawar at [privacy@alawar.com].
</p><p>
<b>Information Relating to Children</b>
</p><p>
The Alawar Website and any products or services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") does not apply.  However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase products and services, or download trial versions of software programs.  The collection of information is covered above.  
</p><p>
Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so in one of two ways.  If you know the user name and password or email address, follow the instructions below regarding Choices Available to You or you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information provided at the bottom of this page.
</p><p> 
<b>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</b>
</p><p>
Alawar operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission.
</p><p>
Alawar takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.   
</p><p>
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Alawar it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Alawar. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and also in other countries where Alawar and its service providers conduct business.  All Alawar employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
</p><p><br>
<b>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b>
</p><p>
<b>How your personal information is used</b>
</p><p>
Alawar collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.  We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected.  If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.  Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of Alawar and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.
</p><p>
Alawar may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.  This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Alawar may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.
</p><p>
Alawar recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, Alawar will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Alawar or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website.  Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Alawar will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
</p><p>
<b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b>
</p><p>
Alawar does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Alawar.  These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Alawar specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Alawar's affiliates for their use without your approval.
</p><p>
Alawar may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Alawar may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
</p><p>
In the event that all or substantially all of Alawar's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Alawar may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
</p><p>
<b>Choices available to you</b>
</p><p>
You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Alawar Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.  
</p><p>
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Alawar or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.  However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.
</p><p>
We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Service or applicable licensing agreements. 
 </p><p>
Alawar is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare. 
</p><p>
If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you must contact Alawar either by email at [privacy@alawar.com] or regular mail at [Alawar Entertainment, Inc 901 N. Pitt Street Suite 325 Alexandria, VA 22314].  
</p><p>
To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Alawar with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records.  The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to Alawar when you requested services or products.  Alawar reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.
