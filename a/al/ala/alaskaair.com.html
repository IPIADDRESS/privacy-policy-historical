	<a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/help/site/cookies.asp">cookies</a>, which are stored on the computer that you use to visit our Web sites. These cookies help you obtain information you have requested as well as personalize your visit.

	<h2>Security</h2>
	We utilize <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/help/site/aboutSSL.asp">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</a> technology to protect the submission of your personal information. This technology provides a certain level of protection when transmitting your credit card numbers and other personal information over the Internet.

	<p>Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. "Perfect security," does not exist on the Internet and under certain circumstances, unauthorized parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. In the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
	
	<h2>How Information is Used</h2>
	We make the My Account functionality available to you in order to expedite your transactions on our Web site (through the use of pre-filled forms) and to provide you with better service. In order for you to complete a purchase or conduct other transactions on our Web site, we may require the creation of a My Account profile, which requires that you submit certain personal information to Alaska Airlines.
	<p>Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, Alaska Airlines will not sell or share your personal information with anybody outside Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air.

However, we may disclose personal information to companies affiliated with Alaska and/or third parties to fulfill the products and services you have requested.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We may share pertinent personal information (including billing information) with our business partners or vendors to enable us to perform routine business functions.</li>
		<li>We routinely use email to communicate with you regarding the maintenance of memberships and services that you have enrolled in. This includes Mileage Plan member information, yearly Boardroom renewal notices, EasyBiz customer information, etc.</li>
		<li>If you have a My Account profile and have opted-in to receive online subscriptions, from time to time, we may share information contained in your profile with our Mileage Plan partners in order to provide you with more opportunities to earn or redeem miles, or to advise you of other benefits associated with our Mileage Plan program.</li>

		<li>We never share member information for members that we know or believe to be under the age of 18, with anyone outside of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air.</li>
		<li>We may disclose personal information in accordance with a lawful request or court order, to protect third-party rights, if we believe that the safety of a third-party would be jeopardized by not disclosing data.</li>
	    <li>If you have a My Account Profile and have not opted-out of “prescreened offers”, Alaska Airlines will share the following information with Alaska's bank card vendor:  Mileage Plan number, first and last name, middle initial, phone number and date of birth. If you wish to opt-out of this process, please refer to opt-out instructions found in the <a href="#Alaska_Airlines/Bank_of_America_Visa_Card">Alaska Airlines/Bank of America Visa Card</a> section.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Travel Related Services</h2>
	To provide you with a single source for purchasing packages that include other travel-related services such as vacations, hotels and/or rental cars, we have entered into agreements with select third-party travel companies that aggregate inventory information from their suppliers. If you desire to purchase a package that is facilitated through alaskaair.com, you will be linked to an <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/help/faqs/Privacy-Links.asp">Alaska Airlines branded Web site</a> hosted by the travel company. If you choose to purchase a package, it is necessary for you to provide personally identifiable information to execute the purchase. This information is then provided to the suppliers (e.g., car rental agency) for processing.
	<p>You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you have supplied directly to a supplier in any manner, in the past or in the future, is subject to their privacy statement and practices, for which Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air has no responsibility.</p>
	
	<h2>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
	In addition to the travel-related services and required information sharing described directly above, Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air do use the services of <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com/as/www2/help/faqs/Privacy-Links.asp"> third parties</a>, that process e-mail and mail for Alaska Airlines and its affiliates, persons authorized by you, as well as such entities and marketing and advertising companies that provide these services for the Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air companies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. Except as described in this paragraph and the sections above titled 'Travel Related Services', we do not permit the sale or transfer of personally identifiable information to entities outside of the Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air companies and our third party service providers for any non-Alaska Airlines use without your approval. We recommend our visitors read and understand the privacy policies of each of these Web sites that they visit.
