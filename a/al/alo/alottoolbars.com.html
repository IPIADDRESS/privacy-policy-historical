<h1>ALOT Toolbar Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>At alot.com, we work hard to deliver valuable web tools at no cost to you while driving revenue for creating and improving alot.com products in the future. Your happiness and satisfaction are very important to us and we hope to include you as one of our millions of satisfied users.</p>

<h3>POLICY OVERVIEW</h3>

<p>We want you to feel comfortable downloading and using our products. We understand that your trust depends on us respecting your privacy and safeguarding any information we may be able to access.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone using ALOT software (the “ALOT Toolbar") to make educated decisions about their online practices. To help you do so, this Privacy Policy details important information that will help answer questions regarding personal privacy in relation to our ALOT Toolbar. Also, this Privacy Policy is incorporated with and subject to the alot.com  <a href="http://www.alot.com/toolbar/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>alot.com’s principle revenue is earned through the ALOT Toolbar’s advertising functions. Generally, sites pay to get certain placement within keyword search results. If a user clicks an ad, the advertiser pays our search partner for the click and we share in that revenue.</p>
<p>alot.com’s web and toolbar web search are powered by our search partner.  Your search queries are passed to our search partner’s servers to produce the results that are returned.  Also, our toolbars may provide the ability to perform quick access searches of a variety of sites related to the themes of the respective toolbars.  Your search queries are passed along to these sites to generate the results that are returned to you.  Note that these sites will generally have their own privacy policies that are not under the control of alot.com.</p>

<h3>Practices</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Our software is installed only with your permission</li>
 <li>We do not collect or track personal information</li>
 <li>We allow you to disable certain search features if you feel they are not valuable to you. </li>
 <li>We make it easy for you to uninstall our software through the standard Add/Remove interface. If you no longer wish to use our software, simply uninstall it. </li>
 <li>We brand each of our products and provide you with links to our customer service department. </li>
 <li>We are proud of our software and our business and are happy to be up front with our users as to what we do. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>

<p>When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personal information" we mean information that might help identify a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>
<p>We do not collect personal information.  We need to collect some non-personal data to power our products and monitor our performance. Here is exactly what we do and don’t do:</p>

<ul>
 <li>We do not collect information that can personally identify a user. </li>
 <li>We collect information that is already available to every website you visit. Examples include Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser version, language and other browser and connection information. </li>
 <li>We use a unique ID in order to know how many people use our products. This ID is not personally identifying; it is a completely random number. </li>
 <li>We track clicks on our toolbars and on our sites in order to optimize the toolbar and our offerings.</li>
 <li>We collect search data that is not correlated to particular users at our search site and via the ALOT Toolbar which is used to monitor and optimize our business performance. We may also share aggregated information with others. </li>
 <li>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you may choose to provide your zip code or other location information to enable us to present the local weather forecast for your area when using our weather products.  You may be required to provide your name and email address when submitting comments or support issues via the support pages of the alot.com site.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
