<p><b><span>Updated: January 1, 2012</span></b></p>
<p><span><br>It is the policy of Alorica Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, âAloricaâ) to respect and protect the privacy of our customers and the users of </span><a href="http://www.alorica.com/"><span>www.alorica.com</span></a><span> (hereinafter, the "Site"). Through this Privacy Statement, we want to reassure users of the Site that we will not sell, share, or rent user information to others in a manner different than as set forth in this Privacy Statement. By accessing this Site, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not use this Site. Each time you use the Site, the current version of the Privacy Statement will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Site, you should check the date of this Statement (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.<br><br><b><span>Consent</span></b><span><br></span>By using our Site, the user agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Statement and the Site Terms of Use INCLUDING ALL LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES PROVISIONS which are an integral part hereof and the user consents to the collection and use of this information by Alorica as disclosed in this Privacy Statement.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Personal Information</span></b><span><br>In general, you can visit Alorica on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.</span></p>
<p><span>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you. You may give us a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Alorica that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you expressly tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.<br><br><b><span>Using and Sharing Personal Information<br></span></b><br><b><span>A. Fulfilling Your Transaction Request</span></b><br>If you request something from the Alorica Web site, for example and not by limitation, a service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request including where necessary sharing such information with third parties to fulfill your request.<br><br><b><span>B. Marketing Use</span></b><span><br></span>The information you provide to Alorica on certain Alorica Web sites may also be used by Alorica and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. To opt-out of receiving further marketing emails from Alorica, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each email.<br><br><b><span>C. Human Resources Web Sites</span></b><span><br></span>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on the Alorica Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Alorica for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry. Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.</span></p>
<p><b><span>D. Information for Business Partners</span></b><span><br>If you represent an Alorica client or vendor (âAlorica Business Partnerâ), we may use information provided on theAlorica Web site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the Business Partner you represent, and Alorica Business Partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of Alorica Business Partner programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other Business Partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Alorica customers or prospects. In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.<br><br><b><span>Information Security and Quality</span><br></b>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its integrity. We implement at least commercially standard measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting sensitive information, with the goal to keep your information secure. Please be aware, however, that no data transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure currently in the marketplace. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, the Disclaimers of Warranty and Limitations of Liability in this Site Terms of Use apply.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Supplementing Information</span></b><span><br>From time to time we may supplement information you give us via the Alorica Web site with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information about businesses. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Use of Suppliers<br></span></b><span>In some cases Alorica uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Alorica's policy and practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Alorica's policies.<br><br><b><span>Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies</span></b><br>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on our Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Alorica or others on Alorica's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies.</span></p>
<p><span>We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Alorica pages use cookies, sent by Alorica or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. If you do not want a cookie, you should set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some of our Web sites may not work properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Some Alorica Web sites also use Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites to provide better customer service. These technologies may be in use on a number of pages across Alorica's Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See âOnline Advertising.â</span></p>
<p><span>If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.<br><br><b><span>Service Quality Monitoring</span></b><span><br></span>Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us or our calling you. Please be aware that it is Alorica's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes.<br><br><b><span>Disclosures Required By Law</span></b><span><br></span>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to law, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.<br><br><b><span>Links to non-Alorica Web sites</span><br></b>Alorica Web sites may contain links to other third party Web sites. Alorica is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.<br><br><b><span>Children's On-line Privacy</span></b><br>Alorica recognizes and agrees with the particular importance of protecting the privacy of children. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</span></p>
<p><b><span>E-Mail Updates and Opting Out</span></b></p>
<p><span>By registering on the Alorica website (âSiteâ), visitors allow Alorica to use their personal identifiable information in accordance with the terms of Aloricaâs privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Upon enews Alert registration, Alorica will send enews announcements and updates as they are posted on </span><a title="www.alorica.com" href="http://www.alorica.com/"><span>www.alorica.com</span></a><span>. We may enhance or merge the information we collect on the Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to our customers and users.</span></p>
<p><span>We may communicate with the users of the Site via e-mail, telephone, mail, or fax in order to provide requested services, content, product information, notification of special offers, or in regard to customer service issues relating to an account. The users of the Site are always given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving subsequent eNews Alerts and having their online information used for purposes not directly related to the Site.</span></p>
<p><b><span>To âOpt-Outâ:</span></b></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive eNews Alerts or have your online information used for marketing purposes, please send email to Alorica: &nbsp;<a class="red-text first-child" href="mailto:tammy.weinstein@alorica.com"><span>tammy.weinstein@alorica.com</span></a><span>.
