<b>Information Collection and Use</b>
<blockquote>

<font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We
will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways
different from what is disclosed in this statement.  <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> collects
information from our users at several different points on our website,
including information about your knowledge level as you use our services
in order to provide you with the next level of tutoring services
suitable to your needs.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Registration</b>
<blockquote>

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the
registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their
contact information (such as name, mailing address and email address),
and choose the educational grade level and topic on which the user
wishes tutoring.  With this information, we will assign you a login name
and password to use each time you return to our site.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Billing Information</b>
<blockquote>

We request information from the user on our billing information form for
the services offered on our website.  Here a user must provide contact
information (name and billing address) and financial information (credit
card number and expiration date).  This information is used for billing
purposes.  If we have trouble processing the billing information, this
contact information is used to get in touch with the user.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Cookies</b>
<blockquote>

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing
information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to
any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the
user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  If a user
rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  Cookies can also
enable us to protect confidential data, and track and target the
interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Log Files</b>
<blockquote>

We use IP addresses  and  hostnames to analyze trends, administer the
site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information
for aggregate use.  IP addresses and hostnames are not linked to
personally identifiable information.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Sharing</b>
<blockquote>

We will share aggregated demographic information with others. This is
not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual
person.<p>

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for our
services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally
identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p><p>

In the future, it is possible that we will partner with another party to
provide specific services. In that event, when the user signs up for
these services, we will share names, or other contact information that
is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  Such
parties will not be allowed to use personally identifiable information
except for the purpose of providing these services.</p><p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Links</b>
<blockquote>

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font>
is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We
encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to
information collected by this Web site.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Updates and Student Reports</b>
<blockquote>

We will notify you of new <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> features and updates via email, unless
you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such notification
which appears under our request for your email address in our Account
Creation forms.  We also will send you a student report of your or your
child/children's progress every two weeks via email, unless you remove
the checkmark next to the text requesting such reports which appears
under our existing student account or new student registration
information in our Account Creation forms.  In order to continue to
receive student reports while subscribing to our services, you must
provide us with your new email address each time you change it.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b>
<blockquote>

From time-to-time it is possible that our site will request information
from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or
contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may
include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact
information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey
information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use
and satisfaction of this site.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Tell-A-Friend</b>
<blockquote>

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend
about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.
<font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them
to visit the site.  <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> stores this information for the sole purpose
of sending this one-time email.  The friend may request the removal of
this information from their database by clicking on the removal link at
the bottom of the invitation.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Security</b>
<blockquote>

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your
information is protected both online and off-line.<p>

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive
information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted
and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -
Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol.  To use this protection
technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape
Navigator 4.5 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher.
While on a secure page, such as our billing information form, the lock
icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or
open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p><p>

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we
also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information
mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need
the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing
clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to
personally identifiable information.  Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,
behind a locked cage.</p><p>

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can
send an email to <a href="mailto:security@aleks.com?subject=ecurity">security@aleks.com</a>.</p><p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Special Offers</b>
<blockquote>

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and
username. Established members will occasionally receive information on
products, services, special deals.  We may in the future send our
customers  a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we
present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please
see our choice and opt-out below.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Site and Service Updates</b>
<blockquote>

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are
not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain
important information about the service. We communicate with the user to
provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their
account via email or phone.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b>
<blockquote>

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your
zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor
to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data
provided to us.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b>
<blockquote>

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their
information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the
point where we ask for the information.  For example, our billing
information form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product
from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail
address off of our lists.<p>

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional
materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these
communications by clicking on the opt-out link on the bottom of e-mail
communications, or by notifying us in regard to other communications at
<a href="mailto:support@aleks.com?subject=opt%2dout">support@aleks.com</a>.</p><p>

In the event we in the future offer services that require an outside
parties, users of our site will always be notified when their
information is being collected by any outside parties.  We would do this
so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should
proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p><p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Notification of Changes</b>
<blockquote>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users on our
Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect,
how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at
any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a
manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will
notify users by way of an e-mail.  Users will have a choice as to
whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We
will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which
the information was collected.<p>

</p></blockquote>
<b>Special Policy on Information Regarding Children Under 13</b>
<blockquote>

We will not knowingly collect online contact information from a child
under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental
notification of the nature and intended use of this information, which
shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the
information and participation in the activity.  Where prior verifiable
parental consent is not obtained, online contact information shall only
be used to directly respond to the child's request and shall not be used
to re-contact the child for other purposes.<p>

Children under 13 years old may use <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font> at  <a href="http://www.aleks.com">www.aleks.com</a> only if the
child's parent or guardian has paid for such use with such parent or
guardian's credit card; such payment is verifiable parental consent.
Children under 13 years old are not permitted to use any <font color="#3333CC"><b>ALEKS</b></font>
"guest" or "free trial" features, because we are unable to obtain
verifiable parental consent for their use of such features.</p><p>

We will not collect personally identifiable offline contact information
from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.  We
will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable
information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable
parental consent. We will not give the ability to children under 13 to
publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact
information without prior verifiable parental consent, and will make
best efforts to prohibit a child from posting any contact information.
We will not entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game,
prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to
participate in such activity.</p><p>
