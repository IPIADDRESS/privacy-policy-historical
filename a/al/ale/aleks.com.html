<p>
	<strong>Plug-ins and Cookies: </strong></p>
<p>
	A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. A plug-in is software which the user downloads and is installed into the user's web browser that enables certain web software to operate. Cookies enable us to protect confidential data, and track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the&nbsp;ALEKS Website. We may also use cookies to track your actions on commercial pages of our website. This information may be used by third-party vendors, including Google, to show you ads about our products or services when you visit other sites across the Internet. If you wish to opt out of the use of data collected on our site to send you targeted advertising during your visits to other websites, go to:</p>

</ul>
<p>
	In order to use&nbsp;the ALEKS Website,&nbsp;a user must accept the installation of one or more ALEKS plug-ins into the user's browser. Cookies and the ALEKS plug-in are not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>
	As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp;We use&nbsp;this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Log files are&nbsp;are&nbsp;linked to personally identifiable information&nbsp;for purposes of (i) tracking and&nbsp;fixing software "bugs" and (ii) as and to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Sharing:</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>ALEKS does <strong>not</strong> disclose or share personally identifiable information with third parties except for purposes of credit card processing&nbsp;as described below.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Credit Card Processing: </strong>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users and parents or guardians of child users&nbsp;for our services. ALEKS Corporation&nbsp;does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Third Party Partners: </strong>In the future, it is possible that ALEKS will provide additional services,&nbsp;or will partner with another party to provide specific services to the&nbsp;users of the ALEKS Website. In that event, such parties will not be allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. In addition, we will&nbsp;not disclose or share personally identifiable information pertaining to a&nbsp;child under the age of 13&nbsp;until we have obtained verifiable&nbsp;parental consent&nbsp;to do so.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>ALEKS reserves the right to disclose to third parties <strong>non</strong> personally identifiable information about our users and their use of the&nbsp;ALEKS Website and related services. For example, ALEKS may disclose aggregate data about the overall patterns or demographics of the users of the&nbsp;ALEKS Website to third parties.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>
	This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ALEKS is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the ALEKS&nbsp;Website.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Transmission Errors or Unauthorized Acts</strong></p>
<p>
	Although ALEKS will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of&nbsp;personally identifiable information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. ALEKS will not be liable for disclosures of&nbsp;personally identifiable information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Required by Law</strong></p>
<p>
	ALEKS may be&nbsp;required by law&nbsp;to release information regarding our&nbsp;users to law enforcement officials or to use the information internally to permit the investigation of credit card fraud, illegal use of the Internet, violation of our terms of service or other cases of misconduct on the&nbsp;ALEKS Website. We reserve the right to disclose&nbsp;personally identifiable information under such circumstances,&nbsp;or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Change of Ownership</strong></p>
<p>
	In the event that there is a change of ownership or sale of assets of ALEKS, whatever information that we have collected from the&nbsp;ALEKS Website may be transferred to a new owner. ALEKS will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the new owners of the information follow the same privacy practices that are described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Updates,&nbsp;Student Reports and Other Communications from ALEKS</strong></p>
<p>
	We will notify you of new ALEKS features and updates via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such notification which appears under our request for your email address in our Account Creation forms.&nbsp;We also&nbsp;send&nbsp;periodic student reports of&nbsp;childrenâ€™s' progress&nbsp;via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such reports which appears under our existing student account or new student registration information in our Account Creation forms. In order to continue to receive student reports while subscribing to our services, you must provide us with your new email address each time you change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
<p>
	From time-to-time it is possible that our site will request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong></p>
<p>
	If a user elects to use&nbsp;any referral service we may provide&nbsp;for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. ALEKS will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. ALEKS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may request the removal of this information from their database by clicking on the removal link at the bottom of the invitation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>
	As&nbsp;part of the registration process,&nbsp;users are assigned a login name as described above (see "Registration" above) and an anonymous password. ALEKS will use the login name and password to identify the user on all subsequent visits to the&nbsp;ALEKS Website. It is the user's responsibility to keep his or her password confidential.</p>
<p>
	ALEKS&nbsp;takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
<p>
	When our registration/order form asks users to enter financially sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher. While on a secure page, such as our billing information form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>
<p>
	While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the financially sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job&nbsp;are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can contact us at <a href="https://www.aleks.com/support/form/security?subject=Security" target="_blank">http://support.aleks.com/security</a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Special Offers</strong></p>
<p>
	We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, or special offers. We may&nbsp;send our customers a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Site and Service Updates</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>We&nbsp;send&nbsp;site and service related announcements to users on&nbsp;occasion when the information contained in such announcements&nbsp;is&nbsp;important.&nbsp; For instance, if our service&nbsp;were to be&nbsp;temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send&nbsp;such an email.&nbsp; You may not opt-out of these communications, which&nbsp;are not promotional in nature.&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>
	If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>
	Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our billing information form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists.</p>
<p>
	Users who do not&nbsp;wish to receive certain communications, such as&nbsp;newsletters or promotional materials from ALEKS or&nbsp;our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the opt-out link on the bottom of e-mail communications, or by notifying us in regard to other communications at <a href="https://www.aleks.com/support/form/?support_issue=other&amp;other_subject=opt%20out" target="_blank">http://support.aleks.com</a>.</p>
<p>
	In the event that in the future we offer services that require&nbsp;outside parties, users of our site will&nbsp;be notified when their information is being&nbsp;collected by any outside parties. We would do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Special Policies&nbsp;Regarding Children </strong><em>(Please note: as stated above, these policies do<strong> not</strong> apply to K-12 Students using ALEKS through their school.)</em></p>
<p>
	We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, and to monitor, and participate with, their children in using the ALEKS Website. We encourage parents to monitor their children's online use, and to help protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personally-identifying information on any website without parental permission.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Children: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian for permission.</strong></p>
<p>
	No personally-identifying information should be provided to the ALEKS Website by children without the consent of their parent or guardian.</p>
<p>
	We will not knowingly collect online contact information from a child under age 13 without prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of this information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Where prior verifiable parental consent is not obtained, online contact information shall only be used to directly respond to the child's request and shall not be used to re-contact the child for other purposes.</p>
<p>
	Children under 13 years old may use ALEKS&nbsp;only if the child's parent or guardian has paid for such use with such parent or guardian's credit card; such payment is verifiable parental consent. Children under 13 years old are not permitted to use&nbsp;ALEKS&nbsp;without the parent or guardian's credit card payment unless the child's parent or guardian has provided another form of legally acceptable&nbsp;verifiable parental consent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. We will not give the ability to children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable&nbsp;information without prior verifiable parental consent, and will make best efforts to prohibit a child from posting any&nbsp;such information. We will not entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>
	ALEKS reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement, or any other ALEKS policy or practice, at any time. Any changes or updates to this Privacy Statement will be effective upon posting to the&nbsp;ALEKS Website. Although we may change or update this Privacy Statement at any time, ALEKS will provide notice of any material changes to this Privacy Statement by posting a notice on the&nbsp;home page of the ALEKS Website. For your information, the date of the last update to this Privacy Statement is listed at the top of this page.&nbsp;We have also provided a print button below so that you can keep a copy of this Privacy Statement for your records.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>
	Privacy and security are important to us all. We welcome your feedback and thoughts on privacy and security.
