		</ul>
				
		<p>IP ADDRESSES</p>
		
		<p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
		
		<p>COOKIES</p>
		
		<p>Our websites use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our websites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites and also allows us to improve our Sites. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie Policy.</p>
		
		<p>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
		
		<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
		
		<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
		
		<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
		
		<p>USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION</p>
		
		<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
		
		<ul>

			<li>Communications: We may use personal information we collect about you to contact you by e-mail, post or telephone with information about the Thomson Reuters Foundation and events that might be of interest to you. You can opt out of receiving these communications at any point by contacting foundation@thomsonreuters.com.</li>
			<li>Internal statistical analysis: We may use the personal information we collect about you to facilitate internal statistical analysis, for example to determine the number of people using a particular service from a specific country or region. We have a policy of anonymising the information where possible.</li>
			<li>Optimisation: To ensure that news and content from our Sites are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer. </li>
			<li>To carry out our obligations to perform the Services or arising from any contracts entered into between you and us or to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
			<li>To notify you about changes to our Services.</li>
																
		</ul>
		
		<p>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</p>
		
		<p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
		
		<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
			<li>If Thomson Reuters Foundation or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
			<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Thomson Reuters Foundation our partners, or others.
