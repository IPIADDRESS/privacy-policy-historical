SmartBear processes data for the purposes as set forth in our Privacy Policy, including to provide the SmartBear Services and as explained in the <a href="#Use">Use of Information</a> and <a href="#Sharing">Sharing of Information</a> sections. To fulfill these purposes, SmartBear may access data, including Personal Data, to provide the SmartBear Services, to correct and address technical, service or security problems, or in response to contractual requirements. Please see our SmartBear Privacy Policy <a href="#InformationCollected">Information We Collect</a> and <a href="#Retention">Data Retention</a> sections for additional details on how we collect, use, disclose and share data, make automated decisions, and retain data, including Personal Data, about individual users or customers.</p>

<p>Our legal bases for the processing of Personal Data are: (i) consent or (ii) any other applicable legal bases, such as our legitimate interest in engaging in commerce, offering products and services of value to the customers of the SmartBear Services, preventing fraud, ensuring information and network security, direct marketing and advertising, and complying with industry practices.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Rights for European Residents</strong>. As a resident of the EU or a country following substantially similar legislation regarding the protection of Personal Data, individuals may have one or more of the following additional rights:</p>

<p><strong><em>Access</em></strong>. To request a copy of the Personal Data we have collected about you by contacting us.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rectification &amp; Erasure</em></strong>. To request that we rectify or delete any of the Personal Data about you that is incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Objection</em></strong>. To object, at any time, to Personal Data about you being Processed for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Restriction of Processing</em></strong>. To request restriction of Processing of Personal Data about you for certain reasons, such as, for example, if you consider Personal Data about you collected by us to be inaccurate or you have objected to the Processing and the existence of legitimate grounds for Processing is still under consideration.</p>

<p><strong><em>Data Portability</em></strong>. To request and receive the Personal Data we have collected about you in a commonly used and machine-readable form.</p>

<p><strong><em>Right to Withdraw Consent</em></strong>. If Personal Data about you is processed solely based on your consent and not for any other legitimate interest, to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of our Processing based on such consent before it was withdrawn, including processing related to existing contracts for our products and services.</p>

<p><strong><em>Right to Lodge a Complaint with a DPA</em></strong>. If you believe our Processing of Personal Data about you is inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory data protection authority (“DPA”).</p>

<p>To exercise any of the above listed rights, please contact us as set forth below and provide sufficient details so that we can respond appropriately. We will process any requests in accordance with applicable law and within a reasonable period of time. We may need to verify the identity of the individual submitting a request before we can address such request. If the request relates to data our customers collect and process through the SmartBear Services, we will refer the request to that customer and will support them in responding to the request. &nbsp;For SmartBear customers, certain information may be reviewed, corrected and updated by logging into the SmartBear Services account and editing the profile information.</p>

<p><strong>Questions and Complaints</strong>. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, SmartBear commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. Residents of a country participating in the Privacy Shield Framework may direct any questions or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield compliance to our Privacy Shield and Data Protection Contact. We will work with you to resolve your issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we have not responded to a concern relating to data processed under the Privacy Shield Framework in a timely manner, or we have not addressed the concern satisfactorily, you may contact our U.S.-based dispute resolution provider, at no cost, at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim">https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim</a>. If neither SmartBear nor our independent dispute resolution provider resolve your complaint, you may have the possibility to invoke binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. However, prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a country participating in the Privacy Shield Framework must first: (1) contact us and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from our designated independent dispute resolution provider; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European DPA) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident.</p>

<p><strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement</strong>. SmartBear’s commitments under the Privacy Shield are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p><strong>Compelled Disclosures</strong>. SmartBear may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Shield and Data Protection Contact</strong>. Unless otherwise specified, the data controller of personal data uploaded to the SmartBear Services is the SmartBear customer for whom such Services are provided and SmartBear is the processor of such data for such customer. In certain cases, SmartBear may also be the controller of aggregated, anonymous or pseudonymous data relating to the SmartBear Services.
