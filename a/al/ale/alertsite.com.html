			<h2>Applicability of Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to apply to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>.</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy is a statement of how information about you is collected from <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>, used and potentially shared by AlertSite.  In particular, this Privacy Policy will tell you:</p>

			<ol>
			<li> What information, including personally identifiable and preferential information is collected from you through <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>;</li>
			<li> Your choices with regard to providing information;</li>
			<li> How the collected information will be used by and with whom it will be shared by AlertSite; and</li>
			<li> The security of transmissions of any information or communications via <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>;</li>

			</ol>

			<h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

			<p>AlertSite does not currently request personally identifiable information from you in order to enable you merely to utilize <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>.  However, AlertSite uses a subscription form for you to request services.  In connection with this subscription form, AlertSite collects your contact information, such as name, address and phone number, e-mail address and financial information, such as account or credit card numbers.  Information collected from the subscription form is used to send orders, billing materials, and information about AlertSite.  This information is also used to contact you when necessary in connection with our services.  Financial information that is collected is used strictly for internal purposes only.  AlertSite will not disclose, sell or give rights to any personally identifiable information from you to any third-party in ways other than disclosed in this policy.</p>

			<p>Some of the information AlertSite receives about you or your visit to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> may be used for our internal research and to help us to improve the site and the services AlertSite offers to its customers. In general, the Internet addresses of computers, also known as IP addresses, are logged to track user sessions on an anonymous basis. AlertSite analyzes this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there.  Some of the information AlertSite receives about you or your visit to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> may be used for research and to help AlertSite improve the site and the services offered to its customers. This IP address tracking is done in the aggregate form and we do not link this information to personally identifiable information.</p>

			<p>During the registration process, AlertSite will pre-populate certain forms with information previously submitted by the user as they work through the process.  This practice is done only to enhance and simplify the registration process. </p>

			<h2>Security of Transmissions</h2>

			<p>AlertSite utilizes its best efforts to protect the security of any information or communication submitted by you to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>, including, but not limited to, any personally identifiable information you may include in such submitted information or communication.  AlertSite uses Secure Sockets Layer to help ensure that submissions and transmissions by users are kept confidential.</p>

			<p>In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises AlertSite's security system, AlertSite shall not be responsible for any occurrences or damages that are directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party's ability to view, use or disseminate your submissions or transmissions.</p>

			<p>AlertSite reserves the right to share or disclose any information or communication you may submit to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> when AlertSite determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information or communication is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against a user who may be:</p>

			<ol>
			<li> breaching the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy or the Agreement of Terms of Use of <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> located at the URL <a href="http://www.alertsite.com/terms_of_use.shtml">www.alertsite.com/terms.shtml</a>;</li>
			<li> causing intentional or unintentional injury to another;</li>
			<li> interfering with another's rights or property, including AlertSite's rights or property;</li>
			<li> violating any applicable law, rule or regulation; or</li>

			<li> such disclosure is required by any applicable law, rule or regulation.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Service Providers</h2>
			<p>We use other third parties to provide enhanced notification services and member credit card processing on our site.  When you sign up for any of these services, we will share information as necessary for the third party to provide that specific service.  In the case of our enhanced notification services such as phone alerts, paging and SMS services, our third party provider is supplied with the telephone number and message the user has requested to be sent.  Our third party credit card processor is provided with the card information necessary to process payment for services we submit and our user authorizes.</p>

			<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. </p>

			<h2>Links</h2>

			<p><a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> may contain links to other websites.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>, and AlertSite makes no representations or warranties about, nor is it responsible for, the privacy practices of other websites.  When you enter a linked website, AlertSite encourages you to read the privacy policy of that linked website, as its privacy policy may differ substantially from that of <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>.</p>

			<h2>Cookies</h2>

			<p>AlertSite utilizes "cookies" to track and store information about <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> users.  "Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored on your hard drive.  Cookies track your personal preferences and activities, but in no way contain or refer to any personally identifiable information.</p>

			<p>If you do not want cookies to be inserted into your hard drive, you can disable its ability to accept and receive cookies through your Web browser.  However, keep in mind that if you disable your hard drive's ability to accept and receive cookies, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the convenience and additional features of <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>.</p>

			<p>AlertSite's use of cookies on <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> allows AlertSite to aggregate certain information about <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a> users.  The aggregated information helps AlertSite to serve you better by compiling user preferences to improve the features of <a href="http://www.alertsite.com">www.AlertSite.com</a>.  AlertSite may also share this aggregated information with third parties, but keep in mind that the aggregated information contains absolutely no personally identifiable information. We do not use cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  AlertSite reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our homepage.</p>

			<h2>Choice/Opt-out (Evaluation Period)</h2>
			<p>AlertSite sends weekly promotional communications to users who have signed up for our 30-day trial evaluation during the evaluation period that contain the users monitoring results to date and additional information regarding AlertSite's products and services. At the end of the 30-day evaluation period, two follow up promotional e-mails strictly containing information about AlertSite's products and services are sent (one the week after the 30-day expiration and the second thirty days later). Consequently, these communications will end no later than sixty days following the beginning of the evaluation.</p>

			<p>In addition to the evaluation period communications, users also receive an order confirmation e-mail along with a security verification e-mail immediately following registration.</p>

			<p>Users are not given the choice to opt-out of receiving the communications described above since they are requirements of registering for a free evaluation of our services. </p>

			<h2>Choice/Opt-out (Other)</h2>
			<p>Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a service from us, but don't want any marketing material such as information about upgrades, discounts or special promotions, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists. For any non-service related communications or information uses, our opt-out mechanism defaults to the opted-in status until users explicitly opt-out for the first time. </p>

			<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:customercare@alertsite.com">customercare@alertsite.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact listed below. </p>

			<h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
			<p>A user may access their personally identifiable information through a secure login provided on our website.</p>

			<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct or update it by making the change directly through your manage account control panel.  If you should no longer desire our services, you may delete or deactivate your personally identifiable information by e-mailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@alertsite.com">support@alertsite.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact listed below. </p>

			<h2>Customer Forum</h2>
			<p>If you use the customer forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this forum, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.</p>

			<h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>
			<p>We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally
			identifiable information such as the customer's name.  We do obtain the
			customer's consent, prior to posting the testimonial, to include
			any personally identifiable information along with the testimonial.
			</p>

			<h2>Questions, Comments &amp; Complaints</h2>

			<p>AlertSite encourages you to provide AlertSite with feedback regarding this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions, comments or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact <a href="mailto:admin@alertsite.com">admin@alertsite.com</a> or send mail to the following address: <br><br>
