			<p>Please note that this policy applies to AA and/or its subsidiaries, but not to websites maintained by other companies or organisations to which we link. Please ensure that you read the Privacy Policy of such other companies or organisations before submitting any personal information. Furthermore, from time to time AA may employ third party business partners to collect personal information on AA's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by AA to fully comply with the AA Privacy Policy as set forth herein. </p>
			
			<h2 id="1">EXACTLY WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU AND BY WHAT MEANS?</h2>
			
			<p>AA collects personal information in several ways directly from its online visitors when they order for themselves, or when they register for a service offered by AA. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping address(es), credit card billing address(es) and birth date so that we can process and fulfil your orders. Credit card details are entered directly into our Protx Payment Partner's systems and are neither transmitted nor held on AA systems. In certain instances we may be required to collect and store additional data including credit card details. This will only be done with your explicit consent. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.</p>
			
			<h2 id="2">OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH OUR SERVICES</h2>
			
			<p>As a user of our services, we may collect non-personal data about use of the website, such as pages visited, times and volume of use of the services as well as Traffic Data. Traffic data includes logs, details of networks, time of log-on or access, length of sessions and similar systems data.</p>
			
			<h2 id="3">WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?</h2>
			
			<p>Our site uses cookies to keep track of how often you visit our site, the contents of your shopping cart, previous purchases and to deliver content specific to your interests. (A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser which tracks your movements within websites.) Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the features of our website, including the ability to purchase items. </p>
			
			<h2 id="4">HOW THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USED, INCLUDING ANYONE IT MIGHT BE SHARED WITH</h2>
			
			<p>AA may use your personal information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalised shopping experience.

We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of your information to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs. If we change our policy on disclosure to others, we will inform you and give you the choice of opting out.</p>
