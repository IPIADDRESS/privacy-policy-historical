      protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information 
      via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
      <br>
      When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
      (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is 
      protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While 
      on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of 
      Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
      becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 
      ‘surfing’. <br>
      <br>
      While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we 
      also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All 
      of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
      above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the 
      information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a 
      customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
      identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected 
      screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must 
      re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. 
      Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
      practices. As well as any time new policies are added, our employees are 
      notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and 
      what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally, 
      the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure 
      environment<br>
      <br>
      If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can 
      send an email to support@alphaimports.com</font></td>
