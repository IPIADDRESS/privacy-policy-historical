Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we will treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>
                <p><strong>Special Categories of Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>We collect the following special categories of personal data about you.</p>
                <p>Details about your:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>dietary requirements which may disclose your religious or philosophical beliefs;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>health;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>race or ethnicity;</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>We collect and process the above data only where it is strictly necessary to do so in order to deliver the travel service that you have purchased. Furthermore, we will only collect and process the above special categories of sensitive personal data where you have provided us with your explicit consent to do so.</p>
                <p>You are not under any obligation to consent to us processing your sensitive personal data. However, without your consent, we won’t be able to make the necessary arrangements to provide the travel services that you have booked or are attempting to book. As a result, if you do not provide your consent, we will be unable to proceed with your booking.</p>
                <p>If you are happy to consent to our use of your sensitive personal data, you will also be able to withdraw your consent at any time. However, as this will prevent us or (where we are acting as an agent) the supplier of your chosen travel service from providing the travel service you have booked, we (or the supplier of your chosen arrangements) will be required to treat any withdrawal of consent as a cancellation of your booking and the cancellation charges referred to in clause 13 of our Agency Terms of Business will become payable.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;<strong>If you fail to provide personal data</strong></p>
                <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.</p>
                <p>Where we are acting as an agent and we need to collect personal data to enter you into a contract with the supplier of your chosen travel arrangements, we may not be able to take steps to enter you into that contract if you fail to provide the data when requested.</p>
                <p>In other words, where we require details from you in order to provide you with your chosen travel services, if you do not provide us with the necessary details then we will not be able to provide (or arrange for the provision of) the services you have booked or are attempting to book.</p>
                <p>In this case, depending upon when you fail to provide the necessary date, we may either not be able to process your booking or we may have to cancel your booking, in which case we will treat this as a ‘cancellation by you’ in accordance with our Agency Terms of Business.&nbsp;We will notify you if we are unable to process a booking or are required to cancel a booking for this reason.</p>

                <h2>3.&nbsp;How your personal data is collected?</h2>

                <p><strong>(B) </strong>External Third Parties as set out in the&nbsp;<em>Glossary</em>&nbsp;shown below.</p>
                <p><strong>(C) </strong>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

                <h2>6.&nbsp;International transfers</h2>


                <p>&nbsp;Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
                <p>Where you have requested a booking for travel arrangements which are located or otherwise due to be fulfilled outside the EEA, we will have to transfer your personal data to the suppliers fulfilling or providing those travel arrangements outside the EEA in order to make your booking and for those suppliers to be able to provide you with the travel arrangements you have booked. Where we are unable to rely on one of the safeguards outlined below when transferring data to those suppliers outside the EEA, we will rely on the derogation under Article 49 of the GDPR in order to transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA (as the transfer relates to the performance of a contract for your benefit), and you hereby permit us to do so. You also acknowledge that where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, controls on data protection may not be as wide as the legal requirements within the EEA.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;For all other transfers of data, whenever your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank">European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en" target="_blank">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</a>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA. See contact details above.</p>

                <h2>7.&nbsp;Data security</h2>

                <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                <h2>8.&nbsp;Data retention</h2>

                <p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></p>
                <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
                <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                <p>If you make a booking with us we will keep your information for 6 years from your return date of travel (in the case of adults) or 6 years from the date of your 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday (in the event of any children that travel on the booking) in order to enable us to defend any legal claims that you may pursue against us.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, by law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for seven years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
                <p>If you require any further information regarding our retention periods then you can request the same by&nbsp;<em>contacting us</em>.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see&nbsp;<em>Request erasure</em>&nbsp;below for further information.</p>
                <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                <h2>9.&nbsp;Your legal rights</h2>


                <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below links, further details can be found in section 10 below the Glossary to find out more about these rights:</p>
                
             
                        <p>(A) Request access to your personal data.</p>

                <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact Mindi Kaur on 0207 741 1200.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;<strong>No fee usually required</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;<strong>What we may need from you</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;<strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

                <p>to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                <ul>

                        <p>&nbsp;<strong>Request correction</strong></p>

We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

                <ul>
                    <li>

                </ul>
                <p>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
