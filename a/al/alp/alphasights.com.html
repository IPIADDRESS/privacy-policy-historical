Any    breach of this <em>Privacy Policy</em> by a Client or a Registered User may result in termination of    usage rights.</p>
<p>This <em>Privacy Policy</em> applies to data about Clients‟ and Registered User‟s businesses and,    more specifically, to personal information supplied by individuals about themselves in their    capacity as (i) employees or representatives of either Clients or Registered Users, (ii) natural    persons who are Registered Users, as well as (iii) visitors to any Site(s). We refer to all such    persons as “Individuals”.

<h3>Personal Information Collected</h3>
<p>AlphaSights collects information voluntarily provided by Individuals during the User    Registration process or Client acceptance procedure. Such information will be complemented    by additional information generated through interaction with the Site(s), through    correspondence, in connection with potential or actual participation in any consultation,    survey, poll or assignment (“Project(s)”) or any other interaction with AlphaSights, Clients or    Registered Users. This will include personal information such as name, contact details    (including email address, postal address and telephone numbers), skills, expertise,    professional biography including academic and employment history, Project participation or    other contributions and, for Registered Users, any compensation parameters including    payment details.
