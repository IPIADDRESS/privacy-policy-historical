This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, use, share and protect personal information provided by Clients, Registered Users or any visitor to our Site(s). Any breach of this Privacy Policy by a Client or a Registered User may result in termination of usage rights.
</p>
<p class="body-copy">
This Privacy Policy applies to data about Clients‟ and Registered User‟s businesses and, more specifically, to personal information supplied by individuals about themselves in their capacity as (i) employees or representatives of either Clients or Registered Users, (ii) natural persons who are Registered Users, as well as (iii) visitors to any Site(s). We refer to all such persons as “Individuals”. By registering on a Site or making use of any services available through the Site, each Individual gives their consent to the processing of personal information concerning the Individual as outlined below. By using our Site(s) in any capacity, you agree to the Privacy Policy in force at that time.
</p>
<p class="double-vertical-spacing highlighted-copy">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>
<p class="body-copy">
AlphaSights collects information voluntarily provided by Individuals during the User Registration process or Client acceptance procedure. Such information will be complemented by additional information generated through interaction with the Site(s), through correspondence, in connection with potential or actual participation in any consultation, survey, poll or assignment (“Project(s)”) or any other interaction with AlphaSights, Clients or Registered Users. This will include personal information such as name, contact details (including email address, postal address and telephone numbers), skills, expertise, professional biography including academic and employment history, Project participation or other contributions and, for Registered Users, any compensation parameters including payment details.
