<h3>OPTING OUT</h3>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by <a href="/contact-us">contacting us</a>. Opting out will not apply to personal data provided to us for other purposes.</p>
<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>AlphaSights may send one or more cookies – text only strings of characters identifying a visitor's browser – when you visit our website(s). You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. AlphaSights records every visit to its website(s) and logs web request and internet protocol address information. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website(s) may become inaccessible or not function properly.</p>
<h3>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</h3>
<p> We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2> 5.  DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA  </h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with third parties such as clients, suppliers, sub-contractors, data processors and any parties to whom we may sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy.</p>
<p> We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not consent to our third-party service providers using your personal data for their own purposes.</p>
<h2> 6.  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h2>
<p>We may share your personal data within the AlphaSights group and external third parties. This may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we endeavour to ensure, pursuant to our agreements with such third parties/group members, that a similar degree of protection is afforded to it as within the EEA. Please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<h2>7.  DATA SECURITY </h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They should only process your personal data on our instructions and be subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2> 8.  DATA RETENTION  </h2>
<p> HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR? </p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as we believe necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, reporting or audit requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available by <a href="/contact-us">contacting us</a>.</p>
<h2>9.  YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS </h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include rights:</p>
<p>To request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p>To request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p> To request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p>To object to processing of your personal data. This is where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>To request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p>To request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p>To withdraw consent. This occurs at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p> If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please <a href="/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED </h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h3>
<p> We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<h3>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND </h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please <a href="/contact-us">contact us here</a>  in the first instance.</p>
