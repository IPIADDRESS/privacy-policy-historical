      <p>HEALTHvision is extremely committed to protecting your privacy. is a 
        founding member of Hi-Ethics (Health Internet Ethics), a coalition of 
        health information Web sites that has developed Ethical Principles for 
        offering Internet health services to consumers. The Principles are designed 
        to help ensure that Internet health services reflect high quality and 
        ethical standards, provide health information that is trustworthy and 
        up-to-date, clearly identify online advertising, disclose sponsorships 
        or other financial relationships, keep personally identifiable information 
        private and secure, and empower consumers to distinguish online health 
        services that follow the Principles from those that do not. HEALTHvision 
        strives to ensure that the operation of this Web site complies with the 
        Principles, including those related to privacy as further described below.

      </p>
      <p><b>Your role, responsibilities, and risks</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need to be an informed user of this site. Please read all our 
          policies in full so you know how our site works and how you interact 
          with the site.</li>
        <li>Pay special attention to your risks as a user. Web site users open 
          themselves up to certain risks, such as data collection. </li>
        <li> Understand how we collect data and how it is used. It is our goal 
          to protect your personal information from misuse. We do, however, offer 
          programs that collect data for special reasons, such as research, scientific 
          studies, and statistics, in which case you may be interested in participating. 
        </li>
        <li>Be aware that use of this site, its services, programs, and the health 
          information on it cannot replace nor is it intended to serve as a health 
          care provider-patient relationship. You must always consult with a professional 
          for diagnosis and treatment for specific health problems. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><br>
        What you should expect from us</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will strive to maintain your privacy, confidentiality, and security 
          at all times. </li>
        <li> It is our goal to ensure your trust and confidence by providing you 
          with as much information as we can about data collection procedures 
          and information when needed. </li>
        <li>We will not sell or share any information you provide, nor will we 
          intentionally use your data without your permission, unless for purposes 
          of maintaining the site or for reviewing the site's use. </li>
        <li> We will make every effort to notify you accordingly of all data collection 
          practices. </li>
        <li>It is our intention to clearly inform you when your risks or privacy 
          may change during the course of using this site. </li>
        <li> We will make every attempt to tell you when our privacy policy is 
          no longer in effect and another one is, such as when you use an integrated 
          program that is being operated on another web site with a different 
          privacy policy.</li>
        <li> It is our goal to make you aware when you leave our site for another. 
        </li>
        <li> We want you to know that this system operates on a secure server 
          and your personal and professional information and health-related personal 
          information is encrypted before it is transmitted. Encryption is a form 
          of scrambling and de-scrambling that ensures that no unauthorized person 
          can see your information.</li>
        <li> We will separate health information content from advertising and 
          sponsorship programs so you can distinguish between the two. </li>
        <li> Where health professionals may interact with consumers, we will make 
          every effort to tell you if this establishes a patient-provider relationship 
          and make available the credentials and qualifications of professionals. 
        </li>
        <li> We will not accept or show you health information content, advertising, 
          sponsored programs, or services that we know to contain false or misleading 
          information or that promote ineffective or dangerous products. </li>
      </ul>
      <b><br>
      Our Security Measures</b> 
      <p>We want your personal information to remain as secure as possible; our 
        business depends on it. We use encryption practices to help insure the 
        integrity and privacy of the personal information and/or health-related 
        personal information you provide to us. As an added security precaution, 
        all personal information and/or health-related personal information are 
        kept on servers with firewalls that meet or exceed industry standards 
        to prevent intruders from gaining access. Although we make every reasonable 
        effort to protect personal information and health-related personal information 
        from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties, you should be aware 
        that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information via 
        the Internet and that hackers or thieves do find ways to thwart security 
        systems.</p>
      <br>
      <b>Changes in our Privacy Policy</b> 
      <p>It is our goal to use personal information and health-related personal 
        information in the manner described in the privacy policy that is in effect 
        when your information is collected. We do, however, reserve the right 
        to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time and will post revisions 
        to our site. If at any point, personal information or health-related information 
        is to be used differently from those practices stated in the privacy policy 
        in effect when your data was colleted, we will notify you. You will be 
        given the choice to opt-in to any additional uses or disclosures of your 
        personal information.</p>
      <br>

        our goal to protect your privacy and we strive to develop practices and

      <p>At different places on our site, you may be asked to volunteer your name, 
        e-mail, address and telephone number. We refer to this type of information 
        asPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) because it can be used to 
        identify or contact you. When this information is combined with any information 
        on your health or medical status, we refer to this information as Personally 
        Identifiable Health Information (PIHI). We often collect information on 
        site use that has nothing to do with you as an individual, only as an 
        anonymous user of the site. We call this information "aggregate information." 
        We intend to use the personal information, health-related personal information, 
        and aggregate information only for the purposes for which it was provided.</p>

        needed to use this site, and we ask that you provide it with the knowledge 
        that it will be used to enhance your experience. This information is kept 
        confidential. We do offer special data collection programs that you can 
        "opt-in" to use, in some cases to receive e-mail on health topics or to 
        participate in a new service. For opt-in programs we provide you, when 
        applicable, with detailed information on: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is collecting the data;</li>
        <li> What data are collected; 
        </li><li> Why and how the data are transferred to a third party;</li>
        <li> How the data are being used; </li>
        <li>How long the data are being collected; </li>
        <li> Who has access to the data; </li>
        <li> What revenue that is generated from data use in relation to advertisers 
          and sponsors; and </li>
        <li>How to opt-out of data collection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that HEALTHvision does not actually collect any personally 
        identifiable health information (PIHI). Any of this information you voluntarily 
        provide to us is collected only by WellMed, a third party content provider,

      <p><span class="text"><b>Where this Information Is Collected</b> </span></p>
      <span class="text"> 
      <p>We collect information about you at several places throughout the site. 
        You will be informed on how this information is colleted at that time. 
        You will also have the ability to opt-in to information collection when 
        you enter the site or use a service. Most information is collected in 
        the following instances:<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Registration</b></p>
      <p>In order to have access to all of the services and content available 
        on our site, you are required to complete a registration form that requests 
        certain information, such as name, telephone number and e-mail address. 
        In addition, you are asked during registration to tell us about health 
        topics that you are interested in. We offer specialized registration for 
        certain programs, events, and classes that may request some or all of 
        the above information. </p>
      <p>We may use your registration information to send you an e-mail confirming 
        your registration with our site, to respond to questions from you, or 
        to notify you if there is a problem with any order for goods or services 
        that you placed. We may also, from time to time, send e-mails, with your 
        permission, on special promotions or newsletters we think may be of interest 
        to you.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Interactive Services/Tools</b></p>
      <p>Some of the interactive tools on our site ask you for <span class="text"><strong>Personally 
        Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> and <strong>Personally Indentifiable 
        Health Information (PIHI)</strong></span>. Specifically, our health risk 
        assessment tools may ask for information on your personal and/or family 
        medical history including height, weight, blood pressure, history of certain 
        conditions and/or diseases and medication history. Our health care professional 
        directory may ask you for information on your insurance plan and geographic 
        location in order to identify listed professionals in your area. The health 
        risk assessment tools use the personal health information you provide 
        to generate a personal health record to help you manage your health. Your 
        personal health record is kept strictly confidential and can only be accessed 
        by using your password and login ID. We will make every effort not to 
        use or disclose your personal health record to any one without your express 
        consent. In some cases, you can permit your physician, pharmacist or other 
        health care-related professional to have access to your personal health 
        record.</p>
      </span><span class="text"> 
      <p> WellMed, Inc. is contracted to provide the health risk assessment tools 
        on this site. When you select to use a tool, you will in fact be working 
        on WellMed's site and it will collect your data and return the results 
        directly to you via our servers. In all instances where a WellMed tool 
        is used, you will have access to WellMed's privacy policy and information 
        on how the tool works and when it was last evaluated.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Chat Rooms/Bulletin Boards</b></p>
      <p>As a service to our users, we may feature chat rooms/bulletin boards 
        where users with similar medical conditions can share information and 
        support one another. In addition, we may also offer online discussions 
        on a variety of topics moderated by medical experts. You should be aware 
        that any information shared in a chat room/bulletin board is public information 
        and you should think carefully before disclosing any personal and/or health-related 
        personal information in any chat room/bulletin board.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Online Shopping</b></p>
      <p> When this service is offered on this site and you purchase nonprescription 
        products and services from us, such as ordering flowers for delivery to 
        a local hospital, we will request that you provide your name, e-mail address, 
        credit card number and expiration date, phone number and billing and shipping 
        addresses.</p>
      <p> If you order prescription drugs or medical equipment, we will ask for 
        all of the information above, as well as the information that you would 
        ordinarily provide to your pharmacist, including your prescribing doctor's 
        name, your residential address, your gender and birth date, any drug allergies 
        and existing medical conditions. If applicable, we will also ask for your 
        health insurance information including the name, address and telephone 
        number of your insurer and your member identification number (which may 
        be your social security number). We may also ask for additional information 
        about your current prescriptions and medical history. This information 
        will help us provide you with the necessary information to make the safest 
        and most effective use of your prescription medication or equipment.</p>
      <p> This information will be kept in the strictest confidence. We will make 
        every effort to maintain the privacy and security of this information 
        at all times. </p>

      <b>How We Use Your Personal Information</b> 
      <p>We continually seek new ways to maintain your trust as a user and improve 
        our offerings. To provide new and better services, we tend to monitor 
        user traffic patterns and try to analyze what our users like and do not 
        like about our current offerings so we can design better services for 
        you. We may also use certain information for testing purposes, site development 
        and planning, and during the normal course of maintaining the site. When 
        you use our site, you automatically allow us to collect this information. 
        In these cases, researchers, business analysts, system designers, and 
        others may have access to the data we collect.</p>
      <p>We do not intend to use or disclose any personal information or health-related 
        personal information you provide on our site to an unrelated third party 
        without your express permission, except as explained in this section. 
        You should know that there are circumstances when, in the ordinary course 
        of business, we will share some information about you with a related third 
        party.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We have relationships with different vendors and suppliers that ship 
          products ordered on our site directly to our customers. In these cases, 
          we provide to the vendor the information necessary to fulfill your order, 
          such as the items ordered, your name, and shipping address. We require 
          these partners to adhere to our privacy policy and have discussed with 
          them that they are not to use our customer information for any other 
          purpose.</li>
        <li>If you have insurance coverage for your prescriptions, your insurance 
          company or prescription benefit manager may have access to information 
          about your orders so they can process your benefits or assist you with 
          your prescription orders, if necessary. This information is shared in 
          accordance with the terms of your health plan and the information remains 
          confidential.</li>
        <li>We may also share aggregate statistical information on our users, 
          sales, traffic patterns and site usage with our business partners and 
          sponsors. There is nothing in this information that could be used to 
          identify or contact you.</li>
        <li>We may, from time to time, contract with vendors to provide specific 
          services, such as data analysis, data storage, e-mail processing, customer 
          service, sweepstakes or special promotions. We ask vendors to adhere 
          to our confidentiality standards and do not permit a vendor to use our 
          customer information for any other purpose. In many of these instances, 
          you will be given the opportunity to opt-in to this collection of information 
          and can opt-out at any time.</li>
        <li>We may share registration data with business partners that maintain 
          a co-branded service or content, only with your affirmative consent. 
          For more information on co-branded sites, read the information below 
          on our relationships with third parties.</li>
        <li>In certain limited circumstances, we may be legally compelled to release 
          your personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search 
          warrant, law or regulation. In the event that we are compelled to disclose 
          personal information and/or health-related personal information to a 
          third party, we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law 
          or court order. We also reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement 
          authorities in investigating and prosecuting users that violate our 
          rules or engage in behavior that is harmful (or illegal) to other users.</li>

      Our Relationship with Third Parties</b> 
      <p>Where third parties such as sponsors, information providers, and health 
        assessment software tools providers, have access to health-related personally 
        identifiable information from this Web site, our agreements with these 
        third parties will follow these privacy principles in giving you notice 
        and choice with respect to their access and use. Where we have relationships 
        with third parties, we will adopt procedures to tell you if third parties 
        have access to personally identifiable information about you from our 
        site. We will take appropriate precautions to prevent inadvertent disclosures 
        of personally identifiable information to third parties and will take 
        immediate steps to eliminate such disclosures, if they occur, once they 
        have come to our attention. </p>
      <p>At present, there is only one third party, health assessment software 
        tool on this Web site. My HealthQuotient™ by WellMed is a personally 
        identifiable health information self-assessment software tool that appears 
        on the Site as part of the "MyHealth" section. As described 
        on the WellMed Web site, the tool "Assesses your overall health status, 
        identifies risks and delivers personalized information and recommendations 
        relevant to your specific needs." The personally identifiable information 
        that you input into the tool will not be disclosed to any third party 
        by WellMed or VHA. Again, please note that VHA does not collect any personally 
        identifiable health information. Any of this information you voluntarily 
        provide to us is collected by WellMed, and their use of personally identifiable 
        information is governed by WellMed's Privacy Policy. Also, if you elect 
        to "opt-in" to receive email communications from VHA, please 
        understand that these communications are coming from WellMed on our behalf. 
      </p>
      <p>If you wish to have your personally identifiable health information removed 
        from the WellMed database, you may do so by submitting a written request 
        to WellMed. WellMed will remove personal information only at the request 
        of an authorized user of their products. In order to verify that it is 
        the authorized user requesting removal of their personal information, 
        WellMed requires you to send a signed statement, including your name, 
        address, email address and birth date, to the address below authorizing 
        WellMed to remove your personal information from their active databases 
        and other readily searchable media. </p>

        Attn: Record Removal<br>
        520 NW Davis St.<br>
        Suite 300<br>

      </span>
<p>WellMed will notify you by email after your personal information has been removed.</p>
      <span class="text"> 
      <p>Additionally, we work with several types of third-party vendors, including 
        those that provide products and services that we integrate to our site, 
        sponsors that provide us revenue through logo and link placement on our 
        site, advertising companies that serve up advertisement programs for the 
        site, and organizations that maintain this site. We request that third-party 
        vendors supply us with information on their security procedures, and we 
        evaluate them periodically to ensure that they are using data in the agreed 
        upon way. </p>
      <p>You should know that our relationship with some third party vendors provide 
        us with revenues based on the number of users who view an advertisement 
        or use a sponsored or co-branded program. These revenues are based on 
        the use of a site and not on you as an individual. In some cases we also 
        receive revenue from the use of external services, such as buying flowers 
        online or other such services, and may get a commission on specific purchases 
        made online. In addition, we may allow third-party vendors to buy aggregate 
        data collected on our site but that data cannot be used to identify you. 
      </p>
      <p>There are three types of relationships that differ from our standard 
        business partner relationship in which we license content or a product 
        for integration. These exceptions are:<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Sponsored or Co-branded Sites</b></p>
      <p>We allow other companies to make services and/or content available to 
        you, sometimes on a sponsored or co-branded basis. To access the services 
        on a sponsored or co-branded site, you may have to complete an online 
        registration form in addition to the registration you completed for us. 
        Whenever you provide registration information on sponsored or co-branded 
        sites, data can be collected. You should read the individual privacy policies 
        of sponsored or co-branded sites. Reading the policies will help you make 
        an informed decision on whether or not you want to use the site.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>• Advertising Servers</b></p>
      <p>We may have relationships with third-party advertising servers to display 
        advertisements on our site. If you click on an advertisement while on 
        our site you will be taken to another site where your risk and privacy 
        change. These third party ad servers may use cookies to collect non-personal 
        information on your preferences and interests via the advertisement you 
        decide to view. We do not give them access to non-personal information 
        that we might collect on our site unless they agree not to use that information 
        in combination with information they already possess to identify our users. 
        We do not intentionally share with third party ad servers any personal 
        or health-related personal information that you share with us.</p>
      <p>You should know that we might allow advertising to be coordinated with 
        health information content on our site. This happens through linking up 
        identification codes with an ad and a health topic. In no way is your 
        use of this site and the health information you view directly connected 
        with advertising. <br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="text"><b>• External Links</b></span></p>
      <p><span class="text">We feature external links to other web sites that 
        we believe you might find useful; however, we do not endorse these sites.<strong> 
        Additionally, unless otherwise noted in this section, links to other sites 
        are provided strictly for informational purposes, and are not based on 
        any fees or reimbursements paid to HEALTHvision for “clicks.”</strong> 
        We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. 
        We will make every effort to notify you when you are leaving our site 
        and we encourage you to read the privacy policy of each site you visit 
        that may collect information or ask you to disclose personal information 
        and/or health-related personal information.</span></p>
      </span> 
      <p><strong>Framed Links.</strong> In some cases, this 
        Web site will “frame” another Web site within this site’s 
        navigation. When this is done, you will be notified that you are accessing 
        another site within this site, and that the framed site carries a different 
        set of policies, prior to accessing it. </p>
      <p>We have agreements with the following organizations 
        to frame their content within our site:</p>
      <p>· WellMed<br>
        · GeoAccess<br>
        · Veritas Medicine<br>
        · Medline from the National Library of Medicine<br>
        · Consumer Product Safety Commission<br>
        · Food and Drug Administration<br>
        · USDA Food and Safety Inspection Service <br>
        · National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</p>
      <p>Veritas Medicine pays a fee to HEALTHvision, based 
        on clicks generated to their site from this site. The use of all other 
        framed sites is not based on any fees or reimbursements paid to HEALTHvision. 
        In the case of WellMed, HEALTHvision pays a fee for their content and/or 
        services. For all other framed sites, there is no financial relationship 
        based on these links.</p>
      <span class="text"><br>
      <b>Our Children's Policy</b> 
      <p>Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to register on our site, 
        or to access areas that require registration. We have established a mechanism 
        in the registration process that does not allow children under 13 to complete 
        the registration process. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected 
        information from an individual under the age of 13, that information will 
        be immediately and permanently removed from our servers. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Your Privacy Choices</b> </p>
      <p>You have the choice on this site to opt-in to information collected about 
        you in most circumstances, the exceptions being the instances when data 
        are used for site maintenance and so on. If you opt-in to data collection 
        we make every effort to give you detailed information on the program or 
        service you select. To opt-out of data collection, make any changes or 
        updates, or request that information be deleted, you have several choices. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Opt-out</b> 
      <p>When you register with our site, you are given the option of receiving 
        e-mail with information that we think you might find useful including 
        promotions, announcements of new services and products, and newsletters 
        on particular health topics. You may also participate in our personalized 
        e-mail reminder system that allows you to send an e-mail reminding you 
        of certain health-related activities such as a doctor's visit or to schedule 
        tests. If you decide, at any time, that you no longer wish to receive 
        these e-mails you may opt-out by deselecting the checkbox on your personal 
        information page. </p>
      <br>
      <b>Change/Update Personal Information</b> 
      <p>You may change or update your personal information and/or health-related 
        personal information at any time using the following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Go to your personal information page and change the information there.</li>
        <li>You can contact us in writing using the address in our Contact Us 
          link</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Remove or Delete Personal Information</b> You may remove previously provided 
      personal and/or health-related personal information at any time using the 
      following options: 
      <ul>
        <li>You can contact us in writing using the address in our Contact Us 
          link</li>
        <li>To delete information from the Wellmed database, please follow the 
          instructions outlined on this page under the header, <strong>"</strong><b>Our 
          Relationship with Third Parties."</b> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Users should be aware that it is not always technically possible to remove 
        or delete the information you provide to us. We back-up our systems to 
        protect information from inadvertent loss, and that means a copy of your 
        personal information may exist in a non-erasable form that may be difficult 
        or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, upon receiving your request 
        we will try to remove or delete all personal information and/or health-related 
        personal information stored in the databases that we use for research 
        and daily business activities. We will not intentionally disclose any 
        personal information stored in a non-erasable format after receiving your 
        request for removal, except as required by law. </p>
      <p>There are certain restrictions on your ability to correct, update or 
        remove the health information you enter into a personal health record. 
        If your doctor or other health care professional has access to your personal 
        health record, and they add information to that record, your personal 
        record could be considered an official medical record for legal purposes. 
        In this case, information cannot be deleted or removed, only updated or 
        annotated. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>• Relationship to Advertising/Sponsorship Policy.</strong>The 
        principles and practices outlined in our Advertising/Sponsorship Policy 
        will be continued and enhanced by the ongoing application of this Privacy 
        Policy. For example, we will not permit any sales or marketing of personally 
        identifiable health information to third party sponsors that would reveal 
        to them personally identifiable medical conditions. We will provide the 
        names and addresses of an individual user to sponsors or other third parties 
        only when you indicate that you desire to review additional information 
        from the third party and understand that your name and address information 
        will be transmitted.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>• Questions or Comments. </strong>We are committed to continuously 
        improving the quality of the health information and tools found on this 
        Web site. If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy
