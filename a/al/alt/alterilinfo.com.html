This policy will be  continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and  our customers’ needs.</p>
<p>What Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types of  information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that  is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information  collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
<p>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</p>
<p>Registration Information<br>

We provide the same protections for these electronic  communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received  by mail and telephone.</p>
<p>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard  technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are Cookies?”)  and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site  is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may  include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our  Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web  site.</p>
<p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering our business activities, providing the products and  services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor the use of  the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our  content and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout,  services and for other lawful purposes.

<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences  allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.  However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the  configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have  your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site  will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.A cookie  cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer  viruses.</p>
<p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow  us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site  and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<p>IP Addresses<br>

IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data  known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request)  can be sent to you.</p>
<p>Sharing and Selling Information<br>
We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that  uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal  details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process  transactions or provide services that you have requested.</p>

You may request access to all your personally identifiable information  that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at  the usual address.</p>

We may also disclose account  information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public.</p>

<p>Our Commitment To Data Security:</p>
<p>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our  computers in the United States.

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are  made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy  changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you  have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior  consent.</p>
