																					<p align="right">Last updated on September 05, 2007</p>
																					<br>
																					<p>At www.alfy.com (the "Site") we recognize that respecting the privacy of our 
																						users ("you") is as important as the quality of the online experience that we 
																						deliver. Our Site complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
																						and related rules (collectively, "COPPA"), which you may read about by clicking <a href="#" onclick="window.open(&quot;http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html&quot;,&quot;privacy&quot;,&quot;toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=770,height=450&quot;)">
																							here</a>.
																					</p>
																					<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it describes our information 
																						collection practices, the kind of information we gather, and how, why and under 
																						what circumstances we may use or disclose your personal information. When we 
																						refer to personally identifiable information we mean any combination of your 
																						e-mail address, full name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card 
																						information, billing address and social security number, or any other 
																						information that would allow someone to identify or contact you. By visiting 
																						and using the Site you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to 
																						comply with the other terms and conditions governing your use of this Site. You 
																						should review the Site's other terms and conditions by clicking <a href="terms.aspx" target="top">
																							here</a>.</p>
																					<p><u>The Information We Collect</u></p>
																					<p>You may access and use most of the content and offerings available on the Site 
																						without providing us with any personally identifiable information. We generally 
																						do not collect any personally identifiable information from users aged 12 and 
																						younger, except that we may collect a valid email address which we use only to 
																						send the user one email message in order to activate the user's Alfy account. 
																						Once the user's account is activated, we delete the email address from our 
																						system. As part of the registration process we may also ask users aged 12 and 
																						younger for other non-personally identifiable information, such as first name, 
																						birth date, gender, and zip code.</p>
																					<p>We do require users 13 years of age and older to provide us with certain 
																						personally identifiable information, such as first and last name, valid email 
																						address, birth date, gender and zip code.
																					</p>
																					<p>In addition, in order to access certain content or to participate in certain 
																						services provided through the Site, all users regardless of age are required to 
																						provide certain personally identifiable information, such as name and email 
																						address. For example, in order to earn and accumulate points on the Site, to 
																						subscribe to an email newsletter that you sign up to receive, to participate in 
																						message boards/chat rooms or to enable your participation in a contest, 
																						sweepstakes or other promotion that you elect to enter, we collect certain 
																						personally identifiable information so that we can provide you with the service 
																						you have selected. Participation in any of these activities is voluntary so you 
																						can choose whether or not to give us this information. Our information 
																						collection, use and disclosure practices with respect to children under the age 
																						of 13 are further described below in a section titled Kids, Parents and COPPA 
																						or by clicking <a href="#CA">here</a>.</p>
																					<p>In general, when we collect any personally identifiable information from you, 
																						you will know because you will have to provide that information by filling out 
																						a form. A user or parent can access and update the user information previously 
																						provided to us, or modify your opt-out choices, by sending us an email 
																						identifying the change to be made to info@alfy.com.</p>
																					<p><u>Information Gathered Through Technology</u></p>
																					<p>In addition to the information that we receive from you directly, we gather 
																						date, time, browser type and the IP addresses of all of our users for our 
																						internal purposes. We keep this information for system administration, for web 
																						server load balancing, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and 
																						for our internal security audit log. We do not link IP addresses to any 
																						personally identifiable information.</p>
																					<p>When your web browser accesses the Site, we collect certain information via 
																						"cookies." "Cookies" are pieces of information that our Site sends to your 
																						computer while you are visiting the Site. Most web sites use "cookies" because 
																						"cookies" make the use of the Site more useful for the user. We do not store 
																						any personally identifiable information in "cookies." nor do we link or combine 
																						information collected through cookies to any personal information that is 
																						submitted online by our users on the Site.</p>
																					<p>We may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our 
																						behalf. These companies may employ "cookies" and "action tags" (also known as 
																						"single pixel gifs" or "web beacons") to deliver advertisements that are more 
																						relevant and more interesting to you, and to measure advertising effectiveness. 
																						We do not control the "cookies" and "action tags" that they employ. Any 
																						information that these third parties collect via "cookies" and "action tags" is 
																						not linked with personally identifiable information that you provide to Alfy. 
																						If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="top">
																							here</a>.
																					</p>
																					<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept "cookies." You can reset your 
																						browser to refuse all "cookies" or indicate when a "cookie" is being sent. You 
																						may disable the "cookies" if you wish by using utilities provided by companies 
																						not associated with our Site. Unfortunately, if you disable cookies on your 
																						computer, you will not be able to take advantage of many of the great features 
																						and content the Site has to offer.</p>
																					<p><u>How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information</u></p>
																					<p>Your privacy is important to us, which is why we do not share your personally 
																						identifiable information with third parties except in accordance with this 
																						Privacy Policy. We use the personally identifiable information and other 
																						information you provide us in order to (a) provide you with the services you 
																						have elected to receive, subject to the procedures for parental consent 
																						described below, such as entry into contests, sweepstakes or other promotions, 
																						email newsletters, and to track the accumulation of points, (b) notify you 
																						about new features and services on the Site or other products and services that 
																						we think you may find interesting; and (c) for analytical purposes to help us 
																						to improve the Site and for our business generally. We sometimes engage third 
																						parties to provide you with products or services that you have requested, like 
																						a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill 
																						prizes for a sweepstakes. We share personally identifiable information with 
																						these third parties as necessary for them to provide you what you have 
																						requested on our behalf. Unless we tell you differently, these third parties do 
																						not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to 
																						them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We will disclose your personally 
																						identifiable information when required by law, for example, in response to a 
																						court order or subpoena. We may also disclose such information in response to a 
																						law enforcement agency or other public agency request or if we believe that 
																						such disclosure may prevent a crime from being committed. We may disclose your 
																						personally identifiable information to enforce our <a href="terms.aspx">terms and 
																							conditions</a> or to protect the rights, property, safety and security of 
																						the Site, our users or others. If all or substantially all of the Site are 
																						transferred or sold to a third party, personally identifiable information 
																						collected by us may be transferred to the acquirer.</p>
																					<a name="CA">
																						<p><u>Kids, Parents and COPPA</u></p>
																						<p>We care about the safety and privacy of all children, particularly those under 
																							the age of 13. We do not ask children under 13 to disclose more personal 
																							information that is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity, 
																							and we always seek parental consent in accordance with COPPA.</p>
																						<p>Generally speaking we do not collect any personally identifiable information for 
																							children under 13 without first asking for parental consent. If and when we do 
																							ask for consent, we do it only in certain types of circumstances, as permitted 
																							by COPPA. For example, we may collect the child's e-mail address before seeking 
																							parental consent when a child asks to participate in a contest on a one-time 
																							basis only, the first time a child requests that we send him or her our online 
																							newsletter (in which case we will communicate with the parent and tell the 
																							parent that we are about to engage, at the child's request, in a regular 
																							communication with the child, and give the parent the opportunity to stop 
																							further communication), when the collection is meant to protect the child's 
																							safety during his or her visit to the Site (and in that case we will notify the 
																							parent and give him or her the opportunity to prevent further use of the 
																							information), and when the collection is done for the purpose of protecting the 
																							security of the Site, or to respond to law enforcement, if necessary. The 
																							e-mail addresses that may be collected from children under the age of 13 are 
																							not used for any other purpose.</p>
																						<p>Other than as described above, we will ask for verifiable parental consent (in 
																							compliance with COPPA), <u>before</u> we collect any personally identifiable 
																							information from any child under the age of 13, and <u>before</u> we use or 
																							disclose any personally identifiable information that a child under 13 has 
																							provided to us.</p>
																						<p>We may seek your parental consent in several ways: for example, via confirmatory 
																							e-mail if we will use the information collected from your child for internal 
																							purposes only (such as, for example, communicating updates about the Site's 
																							content). Before we disclose the e-mail address of a child under 13 to any 
																							third party (or through chat rooms or message boards when the personally 
																							identifiable information has not been stripped from postings) we will get a 
																							signed consent from a parent via mail or fax, or accept and verify a credit 
																							card number in connection with a transaction or subscription, or take a call 
																							from a parent through a toll-free telephone number staffed by trained 
																							personnel, or ask a parent to send us a confirmatory e-mail accompanied by the 
																							parent's digital signature.</p>
																						<p>We also fully comply with COPPA in connection with other types of information 
																							that your child provides us (for example, information collected through 
																							"cookies") if these types of information are tied to personally identifiable 
																							information.</p>
																						<p><u>Links To Other Sites</u></p>
																						<p>To enrich the user experience on our Site, we may provide links from the Site to 
																							third party web sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the third 
																							party web sites that we provide links to. The third party web site operators 
																							(and not us) are responsible for the information collection, use and disclosure 
																							practices of those third party web sites. We advise our users, and their 
																							parents in case of our under 13 year old users, to check the privacy policies 
																							of each of the third party web sites before using it, to understand how your 
																							personal information will be handled on each third party web site.
																						</p>
																						<p><u>Additional Policies</u></p>
																						<p>Certain features of the Site may be subject to additional terms and conditions 
																							and/or privacy policies. In such event, we will give you notice of the 
																							additional policies so that you can review them prior to participating in such 
																							Site features.</p>
																						<p><u>Legal Information </u>
																						</p>
																						<p>Although the Site follows and complies with COPPA, this does not guarantee 
																							safety or that the relevant person is a child or a parent or legal guardian, 
																							and the Site does not guarantee the actual identities claimed by its users. 
																							Also, we do not guarantee that users who are children will not voluntarily 
																							release personal information about themselves or about you or their friends or 
																							other acquaintances on our Site or on web sites that they visit or link to from 
																							our Site. It is very important that parents understand the features, uses and 
																							potential risks of using any website. That's why we advise all users and their 
																							parents to practice safe computing and urge parents to advise their children 
																							not to give out any personally identifiable information without their consent.</p>
																						<p><u>Changes And Updates</u></p>
																						<p>We reserve the right to change the information, features, products, policies, 
																							promotions, disclosures and disclaimers of this Site at any time, including 
																							this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of the Site of any material changes 
																							to this Privacy Policy by posting on the Site a revised Privacy Policy, which 
																							will indicate the new effective date of such Privacy Policy. <b>BY VISITING THE 
																								SITE, YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, UNLESS YOU ARE 
																								A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13, IN WHICH CASE, YOUR PARENTS ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY 
																								POLICY</b>. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically to determine if 
																							any changes were made to it since you last visited us. Your continued use of 
																							the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you 
																							have accepted such changes. In the event there is a material change in the 
																							information collection, use or disclosure practices described in this Privacy 
																							Policy, we will provide parental notification of the changes and give parent's 
																							the opportunity to withdraw consent to the new uses.</p>
																						<p>If you are a user or a parent and have any questions or comments about this 
																							Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at:</p>
