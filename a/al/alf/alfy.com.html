<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center">Privacy Policy</p>

<p>At www.ALFY.com (the "Site") we recognize that respecting the privacy of our users is as important as the quality of the online experience that we provide.</p>

<p>Currently, you may access and use the content and offerings available on the Site without any registration process and without any personally identifiable information. We currently do not collect any personally identifiable information from any user.</p>

<p>Some games on the Site may ask the user questions for gaming purposes; for example, a game on the Site may ask the user to provide a "name" to be used within that game.  You are under no obligation to provide your real-life name or any personal identifiable information; and we do not retain such user-provided information beyond the scope of the particular game being played.</p>

<p>The servers on which the Site is hosted may gather various technical details about visits to the Site.  For example, the servers may log the date of each visit, the time of each visit, browser type of visitors, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of visitors, links followed within the Site, and other information.  We may retain and/or use such information for various purposes, for example, for server load balancing, for system administration, for quality control, to report aggregate data to advertisers, and for our internal security audit logs.</p>

<p>When your web browser accesses the Site, we collect certain information via "cookies": a cookie is a file or an information item that the Site writes into your computer and/or reads from your computer while you are visiting the Site.

<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can configure your browser to refuse or reject or disable all cookies, or to alert you when a cookie is being sent. If you disable or limit the utilization of cookies on your web browser, some of the content and/or games on the Site may not be operational or usable.</p>

<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements or banners on the Site. These advertising companies may use cookies and/or "action tags" (also known as "single pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") in order to select and/or deliver advertisements that are more relevant and more interesting to each user, to measure or estimate advertising effectiveness, or for other advertising-related purposes.  We do not control the cookies and/or "action tags" that such advertising companies may employ.</p>

<p>The Site may include online games, typically Flash games or Java games or Shockwave games, that were developed by third parties and/or are hosted on servers of third parties.  Such third parties, whose content may appear on the Site, may have different data collection practices and different privacy policies.</p>

<p>The Site may include links to third party web-sites. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party web- sites that we provide links to. The third party web site operators (and not us) are responsible for the information collection, use and disclosure practices of those third party web-sites.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change the information, features, products, policies, promotions, disclosures and disclaimers of this Site at any time, including this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of the Site of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting on the Site a revised Privacy Policy, which will indicate the new effective date of such Privacy Policy.
