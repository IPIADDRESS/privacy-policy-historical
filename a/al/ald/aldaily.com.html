Arts &amp; Letters Daily (ALDaily) is committed to maintaining your confidence
and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to
protect personal information which you provide online.
<p>
<b>Personal Information</b>
</p><p>
Currently we do not ask for registration on the site, nor do we keep track
of any personal information (name, address, e-mail address) of any visitors
to the site.
</p><p>
It is the policy of Academic Partners LLC, the parent company of Arts &amp;
Letters Daily, that personal information, such as your name, postal and
e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential.
Accordingly, any personal information you might provide is stored in a
secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only
for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to
your request or to handle your complaint).  The following policy is
intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you
make use of our sites and their features.
This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
</p><p>
<b>Traffic data</b>
</p><p>
Each time a visitor comes to an Academic Partners Web site, our servers --
like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information,
including, for example, the visitor's
domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or
whitehouse.gov),
referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited
prior to
clicking through to an Academic Partners Web site) and browser and platform
type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
</p><p>
We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis
of general
traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how
traffic flows
within the sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about
visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an
aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your
individual identity or personally identifiable data without your
permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies,
no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
</p><p>

<b>Advertising</b>
</p><p>
ALDaily has a contract with an outside company, DoubleClick Inc., to use
its technology to deliver ads on our site. This allows us to deliver ads to
users according to such factors as domain name, geographic location, and
editorial content.
</p><p>
ALDaily is not a member of the DoubleClick Network. Our agreement with
DoubleClick specifies that information about our users may only be used to
deliver ads on our site and may not be aggregated with other information
collected by DoubleClick. We do not provide any personal information, such
as names, postal addresses, phone numbers, or e-mail addresses, to
DoubleClick. The only information DoubleClick receives is what is
automatically passed by a Web browser, such as an Internet Protocol number,
domain name, and browser type.
</p><p>
ALDaily also works with BURST! Media to deliver ads to the site. All users
who receive an ad served by BURST! retain complete anonymity where BURST!
is concerned. As ads are delivered, BURST! does not acquire or collect any
personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email
address all remain your private properties. BURST! does, however, collect
information which is specific to how you use the Internet. BURST! servers
note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the
server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the
type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained
solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's
effectiveness on behalf of BURST! clients and customers.  To view Burst's
complete privacy policy statement, please <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp">visit their site</a>.
</p><p>

<b>Use of cookies</b>
</p><p>
A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a
Web server
and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used for several
purposes, but we only use cookies in a limited way.  We allow our traffic
counter(Hitbox.com) to use cookies to identify the number of unique
browsers that visit our sites and to keep track of how many times browsers
visit the site.
</p><p>
We also allow BURST! Media to use cookies to help serve advertisments.
Unlike many other ad networks, BURST! does not use cookies for the purpose
of setting unique identifiers that are used to identify you whenever you
return to a web site within the BURST! Network, they are just used to help
serve ads on the site you are visiting.  Cookies cannot be used to identify
individuals, only machines, so advertisers will not know who you are.  Most
web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your
browser to prevent that use if you desire.
</p><p>
<b>Promotion</b>
</p><p>
From time to time, ALDaily may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events
which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and
demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used
for the
event. ALDaily may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies,
in which
case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to
be shared
with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A
registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be
released to
any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's
consent,
and ALDaily will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the
registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information
with any
other businesses or organizations.
</p><p>
<b>Surveys</b>
</p><p>
ALDaily may from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the
site to
obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be
compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third
parties, but no
personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.
</p><p>
<b>Other disclosure of personal information</b>
</p><p>
ALDaily will not otherwise use or disclose any personal information you
provide to us without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy
policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. 
</p><p>
<b>Other sites</b>
</p><p>
ALDaily contai
ns many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and
are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web
sites.
</p><p>
<b>Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?</b>
</p><p>
If you have any further questions or concerns about ALD's privacy policies
and use
of personal information, please send them to <a href="mailto:web@academicpartners.com">web@academicpartners.com</a>

<font size="2"><p>New material is added to <b>Arts &amp; Letters Daily</b>
six days a week. We continually test links for reliability. However,
despite our best efforts, links may fail (often only temporarily) without
warning. We apologize for any inconvenience. </p>
<p>New links are added at or near the tops of sections, with older ones
sliding down the columns accordingly. Most items will continue to be
available for three or more days. </p>
<p>Items removed from the main page are transferred to our <a href="arch.htm"><b>ARCHIVE</b></a>. As  most links will eventually expire,
we urge readers who see an item  especially worth keeping to save it while
the link is still valid.  Items removed from the main page during 1999 have
been moved to our <a href="arch99.htm"><b>1999 ARCHIVE</b></a>. Items
removed from the main page during 1998 have been moved to our <a href="arch98.htm"><b>1998 ARCHIVE</b></a></p>
