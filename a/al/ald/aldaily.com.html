<li><strong>Affiliates</strong>. We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personal information will be subject to this Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Affiliated Third Parties.</strong> If you are a registered user of Vitae, we do not sell or rent any information about you to nonaffiliated third parties.&nbsp; For non-Vitae users, we may disclose your name, email address, position, and mailing address to nonaffiliated third parties for the purpose of marketing products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. &nbsp;You may opt out of any such marketing by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:help@chronicle.com">help@chronicle.com</a>.

</ul>
<p>In addition to the disclosures described above, for our Vitae users, we also may share your Vitae information in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other Vitae Users.</strong> Unless you choose otherwise, your User Profile in its entirety will be available to all other members of Vitae.&nbsp; Your user name and any information that you post to Vitae, including, without limitation, reviews, comments, and text, will be available to, and searchable by, all Vitae users, to the extent that you have chosen to make your information public. Your user name may be provided to members whose profiles you view.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Institutions and Recruiters</strong>. If you “follow” an institution, express an interest in learning about career opportunities or research opportunities, or about other things we view as reasonably consistent with your expressed interests, we may share your information, including your User Profile, with academic institutions and recruiters (as applicable), even if you have chosen to make your User Profile private. If you have not chosen to make your User Profile private, academic institutions and recruiters (along with other visitors to Vitae, as noted above) will have access to your information, and may contact you to build out their networks, find new talent, search your profile, or otherwise interact with you.</li>
<li><strong>Employment Applications.</strong> If you apply for an open position posted on Vitae, we will provide the employment materials that you select to the recruiter, educational institution, or other entity that is involved in the hiring process, as is applicable based on the particular posting. Additionally, some educational institutions (and/or the companies that the institution may use to manage applications through a hosted applicant or other tracking system) may offer you the option to upload certain application information (such as contact information, education, experience, and other sections from your Vitae profile, which may vary by institution), by using Vitae. If you apply for an open position posted on such a third-party website using the Vitae feature on that website, then you will be granting such third-party providers access to your information, and your information will be governed by their terms and privacy policies.  See <a href="#thirdPartyLinks">Third-Party Links</a> below.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Letters of Recommendation.</strong> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Ferpa) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records, including the right to provide written consent before the educational institution discloses personal information from the student’s education records. In addition, the student has a right to read a letter of recommendation containing such personal information provided by a representative of an educational institution. If you are a student or otherwise qualify under Ferpa, you understand and acknowledge in requesting a letter of recommendation or otherwise using the services to secure employment, that your information may be transferred to the prospective employer. You understand and agree that The Chronicle cannot control or be responsible for subsequent distribution of this information by the recruiter, educational institution, or other entity other than to provide the information for the stated purpose. You are consenting to the disclosure of any information contained in your education record, and to waive the right to read the letter of recommendation.</li>

You may restrict, however, who may view your User Profile and what information persons may see in your User Profile. To do so, log into your account and select the appropriate privacy setting.</p>
<p><strong><a name="useOfCookies"></a>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms.</strong> We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.</p>
<p>We use these technologies to recognize you and to provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies to ensure that your browser does not see the same advertisement repeatedly, to present ads in a series or sequence, and to measure the number of unique visitors who have viewed a particular ad. We use cookies to store user preferences, record past activity on a site in order to better service you when you return, and to customize web page content based on users’ browser type or other information that you have provided.</p>
<p>We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. We also permit third-party cookies on our Site.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session Cookies</strong>. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="disablingCookies"></a>Disabling Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and  how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site but will not have access to most areas of our Site.</p>
<p><strong><a name="localStorage"></a>Local Storage Objects.</strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel,” and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
<p><strong><a name="clearGIFs"></a></strong><strong>Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags, and Other Technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
<p><strong><a name="adNetworks"></a>Advertising/Third-Party Ad Networks and Online Tracking.</strong> We, advertisers, sponsors, and our third-party service providers may use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. We, advertisers, our third-party service providers, and the ad networks may track your behavior on this Site. Specifically, third-party ad-network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic-measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or nonpersonally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our Service.</p>
<!--
<p>One of our third-party service providers is Criteo, a digital performance advertising company.

<p>You may opt out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding the use of this information used by these companies, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> (NAI) and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (DAA).</p>
<p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) means only that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean that you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements based, for example, on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or if you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer, or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s websites, accessible by the links above.</p>
<p><strong><a name="userGenerated"></a>User-Generated Content.</strong> We invite you to post content to our Site, whether in your User Profile or through contributing to our blogs, columns, video logs, or posting webinars.</p>

<p><strong><a name="securityPI"></a>Security of Personal Information.</strong> We have taken commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best reasonable efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
<p><strong><a name="accessPI"></a>Access to Personal Information.</strong> You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your User Profile.
