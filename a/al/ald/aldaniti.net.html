                          A ldaniti  uses Sitestat, a Nedstat product, to measure and analyse information  with respect to your visits to the Aldaniti  site.

<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"> Aldaniti  also uses cookies to improve your login experience. A cookie is a  small file that is stored on your computer when you visit a website.  If you visit the website again, it is recognized as a repeat visit by  means of the cookie. The cookie contains merely a unique number and  therefore no personal data., and the cookie cannot be used to  identify you when you visit any other web sites including web sites  of third parties such as Nedstat.</p>
                        <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" xml:lang="en-GB"> For  example, Aldaniti may store your login details in a cookie that will  remain on your computer after you log out.
