 <p>Collectively, the terms below are referred to as the "Agreement." Alien
                      Technology Corporation and its affiliates worldwide (collectively "ALIEN")
                      are committed to taking reasonable steps necessary to protect
                      your privacy. Once you choose to provide your "personal
                      data" to ALIEN (any information by which you can be individually
                      identified), ALIEN will endeavor to make sure it is only
                      used in connection with your business relationship with
                      ALIEN. However, by submitting personal data to ALIEN, you
                      indicate that you consent to ALIEN's use of such data as
                      described within the scope of this Privacy Policy. Should
                      you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, however,

                <h2 class="header2">Purpose of Collection</h2> 
                <br> 
                ALIEN may in the course of business collect personal data that
                is voluntarily provided by you at our web site. When you provide
                personal data to ALIEN, ALIEN will usually inform you of the
                purposes for which it is being collected. The potential uses
                include, among others, providing requested information or educational
                materials, providing ALIEN services via online access, or training
                or educational activities. Our policy is not to share personal
                data with unrelated companies, except as provided for in this
                Agreement or as described at the time of collection or as necessary
                in connection with internal information processing activities.
                We recognize that your data is confidential and we will take
                all reasonable measures to protect your data while it is in our
                possession. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Collection of Personal Data by ALIEN</h2> 
                <br> 
                When you submit your personal data at this web site in response
                to a registration form or while accessing applications located
                at this web site, the data controller/administrator collecting
                the personal data for purposes described is Alien Technology
                Corporation, a Deleware, USA company. ALIEN normally only requests
                limited business-related personal data, such as name, title,
                company address, e-mail address, and telephone and fax numbers,
                and other information necessary to respond to your request. ALIEN
                disclaims any legal duty to verify the accuracy of any personal
                data that you provide to ALIEN. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                Typically ALIEN will ask for you to submit personal data at the
                following times:
                <ul> 
                  <li>Registration to gain access to certain areas of the site
                    or for Alien Academy;</li> 
                  <li>When we have to respond to your request for further information;</li> 
                  <li>When we will need to distribute requested reference materials,
                    products or services; and</li> 
                  <li>Obtaining resumes submitted by you in connection with seeking
                    employment; and</li> 
                </ul> 
                It is ALIEN's policy to collect personal data only when its collection
                is necessary. In any instance where non-mandatory information
                is sought, you will be notified of this at the point of collection. ALIEN's web site is not structured
                to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intended to collect
                personal information from anyone we know to be under 13 years
                of age. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Collection of Personal Data by ALIEN Affiliates</h2> 
                <br> 
                When you link to the web site of an ALIEN affiliated, or an ALIEN
                sister company (or its subsidiary), referred to below as "ALIEN
                Affiliates", and you are asked to submit personal data, the data
                controller/administrator collecting the data for that web site
                or application shall be the applicable ALIEN Affiliate as described
                in any supplemental Privacy Policy information provided. In such
                instances, you may be asked to review to the appropriate supplemental
                Privacy Policy information and, if applicable, asked to complete
                and submit necessary consent forms to assure ALIEN's and each
                ALIEN Affiliate's compliance with the privacy laws, governing
                the collection and use of personal data in your country of residence. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Consent To Collection And Use</h2> 
                <br> 
                By voluntarily accessing the applications, services or information
                provided to you by ALIEN and any ALIEN Affiliate on their web
                sites you acknowledge that such access is requested by you to
                facilitate our mutually beneficial business purposes. ALIEN and
                each ALIEN Affiliate therefore reserves the right to deny access
                to such services or information by you, where you decline to
                provide requested consent, if such consent is required by law
                in your country of residence in order for ALIEN or any ALIEN
                Affiliate to process or transfer the necessary personal data.
                You agree that by checking an "I Agree," "I Consent" or similar
                box, or voluntarily disclosing your personal data at an ALIEN
                web site, you may be deemed to have granted your limited consent
                to the mutually beneficial uses reasonably contemplated at the
                time of your consent, including ordinary data processing activities
                by third parties on ALIEN's behalf, to the extent such consent
                is legally sufficient in your country of residence. ALIEN ordinarily
                uses your data to better understand your needs and provide you
                with better service. Specifically, we use your data to update
                you on the benefits and features of ALIEN products and services
                and to provide you with information and material requested by
                you. From time to time, we may also use your data to contact
                you for market research or to provide you with marketing information
                we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will
                always do our best give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving
                such direct marketing or market research material. We will also
                follow internal requirements for avoiding the delivery of unwanted
                mail to you, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving
                unsolicited material, where applicable. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Consent To Export of Personal Data</h2> 
                <br> 
                Where collection of your information may be deemed to be "exporting" your
                personal data under the laws of your country of residence, you
                agree that providing your personal information to ALIEN or an
                ALIEN Affiliate located in a jurisdiction other than your country
                of residence shall be deemed your express consent to the transfer
                of your personal information outside your country of residence,
                to that of the designated data controller/administrator, for
                the mutually beneficial uses reasonably contemplated at the time
                of your consent. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Sensitive Personal Data</h2> 
                <br> 
                ALIEN's intention is not to seek any sensitive personal data
                through our web site. Sensitive personal data includes a number
                of types of data relating to: race or ethnic origin; political
                opinions; religious or other similar beliefs; trade union membership;
                physical or mental health; sexual life or criminal record. We
                suggest that you do not provide sensitive data of this nature,
                unless as part of an employment application. If you elect to
                provide sensitive personal data not requested by ALIEN, you expressly
                consent to ALIEN's use of that data consistent with the mutually
                beneficial uses reasonably contemplated at the time of your consent
                or as more specifically described at the point where you choose
                to disclose your personal data. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Transfer of Personal Data</h2> 
                <br> 
                Personal data collected by ALIEN may be transferred to ALIEN
                Affiliates, which are member companies of the worldwide ALIEN
                organization, where it is necessary to meet the purpose for which
                you have submitted the information. By submitting personal data
                on ALIEN's web site, you are providing explicit consent to worldwide
                transfer of such personal data to, and use by ALIEN or any ALIEN
                Affiliate, within the scope of the privacy policies stated by
                ALIEN or any ALIEN Affiliates. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Cookies</h2> 
                <br> 
                Cookies may be used on some pages of our site. "Cookies" are
                small text files placed on your hard drive that assist ALIEN
                in providing a more customized web site experience. For example,
                a cookie can be used to store registration information in an
                area of the site so that a user does not need to re-enter it
                on subsequent visits to that area. The use of cookies is intended
                to make navigation of our web sites easier for you and to facilitate
                efficient registration procedures. Cookies also enable us to
                monitor individuals' use of our site for the purpose of continuing
                to improve its usefulness. If you are concerned about cookies,
                most browsers permit individuals to decline cookies. In most
                cases, you may refuse a cookie and still fully navigate our web
                sites. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Third Parties</h2> 
                <br> 
                ALIEN will not sell, rent, or lease your personal data to others.
                Unless we have specifically informed you, obtained your consent
                or are required by law, we will only share the personal data
                you provide online with ALIEN Affiliates and/or business partners
                who are acting on our behalf, and then only for the uses described
                in "Use of Data". If there is an instance where ALIEN may desire
                to share such information with third parties, you will be asked
                to consent to such disclosure at the time you submit the data.
                However, the sharing of such information will be made only for
                purposes consistent with the uses described in the Privacy Policy. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Legally Compelled Disclosure</h2> 
                <br> 
                Despite ALIEN's commitment to protecting your personal data,
                there may be circumstances under which ALIEN may be deemed to
                be legally compelled to disclose your personal data. These circumstances
                may include, among others, situations where disclosure is required
                by law applicable to ALIEN, or necessary to comply with an order
                of a court or governmental agency, or necessary for matters of
                safety and security. In such cases, ALIEN will make good faith
                efforts to provide only that information which is the subject
                of the official order or request. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Third Party Links</h2> 
                <br> 
                There are several places throughout the ALIEN web site that may
                link to other web sites that do not operate under ALIEN's privacy
                practices. ALIEN does not endorse or make any representations
                about them, or any information, software or other products or
                materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from
                using them. When you link to other web sites, ALIEN's privacy
                practices no longer apply and ALIEN assumes no responsibility
                for the information or other practices of a site that is accessible
                through ALIEN. We encourage you to review each site's privacy
                policy before disclosing any personally identifiable information. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Data Retention</h2> 
                <br> 
                ALIEN does not retain all of the data that we receive. Contact
                information about visitors will be kept as long as the information
                is valid or until a user with appropriate authorization requests
                in writing that we delete that information. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Your Choices</h2> 
                <br> 
                ALIEN respects your right to make your own choices about how
                your personal data is handled. Should you choose to subscribe
                to mailing lists or any registrations, and later decide to unsubscribe
                we will provide instructions, on the appropriate web site area
                or in communications to you or you may contact ALIEN at privacy@alientechnology.com.
                In addition access to certain applications or services may involve
                particular uses, disclosure or transfer of the personal information
                being collected during registration for that application or service.
                If required under the laws of your country of residence, you
                will be notified of such intended uses, transfer or disclosure
                and asked to provide your consent. Failure to provide you consent
                where so requested may mean you will not be provided access to
                the applications or services for which your personal information
                cannot be lawfully processed. <br> 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                <h2 class="header2">Accuracy, Access &amp; Further Notification</h2> 
                <br>
