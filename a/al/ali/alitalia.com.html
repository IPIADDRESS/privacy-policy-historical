            POLICY AND CONSENT TO THE USE OF PERSONAL DATA, PURSUANT TO ITALIAN LEGISLATIVE DECREE NO. 196 OF JUNE&nbsp;30, 2003, ART. 13 
        </div>
        <div class="section_text">
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alitalia Società Aerea Italiana S.p.A. ("Alitalia S.p.A.") handles all of its customer data according to the legislation referred to in Italian legislative decree no.&nbsp;196 of June&nbsp;30, 2003, regarding the "Personal data protection code," which implements the European Union directives on this subject in Italy.
<br><br>
Alitalia S.p.A. ensures that the processing of personal data—however it is obtained—is performed with respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as the individual's dignity, with particular reference to confidentiality, personal identity and the right to personal data protection. This policy is not valid for data collected through Alitalia's partner websites, which may be accessed using links on the Alitalia website, for which the company is not responsible in any way. For such processing, a separate policy should be provided by the respective owners.
<br><br>
For security reasons, Alitalia is required, to an increasing extent, to notify the various local authorities worldwide—the immigration and customs service in particular—of our customers' personal and travel data, obtained as part of normal flight schedules; as well as in Italy where requested by the Central Directorate for Immigration and Border Police. This notification is required in order to implement the contract of carriage.
<br><br>
Furthermore, measures taken to ensure data confidentiality comply with the provisions set out in the opinions of the Working Group Art. 29&nbsp;for Personal Data Protection no. 2/2007 of February&nbsp;15, 2007, reviewed and updated on June&nbsp;24, 2008, on the information for passengers concerning the transfer of PNR data to the United States authorities (for more details, please see Information for Passengers Traveling to the United States).
<br><br>
Please carefully refer to this page regularly to check for any necessary updates or revisions, as well as to adopt and/or conform to national, community or international legislation, or to adapt to technological innovations.
<br><br>
Updates will be reported on this web page and will remain visible at all times, so that anyone who wishes to do so can be fully informed about the use of their own personal data through the Alitalia website or through other different data collection channels.
