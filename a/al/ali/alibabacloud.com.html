            <article class="product-description markdown-body">
                <p>(Effective Date: May 25, 2018)</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the access and use of the Alibaba Cloud International Website currently located at www.alibabacloud.com and the Alibaba Cloud International Marketplace Platform currently located at www.alibabacloud.com/marketplace (the “<strong>International Marketplace</strong>”) (collectively the “<strong>Alibaba Cloud Platform</strong>”), including, and the use by registered users of the Alibaba Cloud Platform of Alibaba Cloud products and services (the “<strong>Cloud Services</strong>”) provided by the Alibaba Cloud entity listed in Clause 2 of the <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/faq-detail/42417.htm" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>  (referred to as “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>Alibaba Cloud</strong>” hereinafter). Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the same meaning as in the Terms of Use of the Alibaba Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we collect, use, transfer, retain, secure and disclose your personal data and/or personal data about your customers or end users that you provide to us pursuant to your use of the Alibaba Cloud Platform and/or our Cloud Services, as well as other terms relating to data location. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal data. </p>
<p>Many of our Cloud Services offered through the Alibaba Cloud Platform are intended for use by business organisations. If you use your organisation’s email address to register an account and purchase or use our Cloud Services, the owner of the domain associated with your organisation’s email address, and/or your organisation, may monitor or control your account with the Alibaba Cloud Platform and access, process, and/or control your personal data, as well as the contents of your communications and files. Your organisation’s use of our Cloud Services may be subject to your organisation’s own rules or policies, and you shall direct all privacy enquiries relating to such rules or policies to your organisation’s administrators. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organisation.</p>
<p>Cloud Services may be used by our customers (i.e. registered users of Alibaba Cloud) to develop or host their own services and products for the customer’s end users. Any information collected or handled by Alibaba Cloud in such circumstances is processed on behalf of our customer who controls the collection and use of such information. We do not have a direct relationship with the end users of our customers. Where this is the case, end users should direct all privacy enquiries, such as any requests to access, correct, amend or delete personal information, to the Alibaba Cloud customer providing their services or products. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers.</p>
<p><strong>A. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>

<p>Our legal basis to process personal data for EEA Users includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and Alibaba Cloud (for example, to provide you with the Cloud Services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the website or Cloud Services); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve our Services); <strong>and based on your consent (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>We may disclose your personal data to third party service providers engaged by us to assist with providing you with our services (including partners providing customer services to you, contacting you regarding promotions products and services, performing risk control, fraud prevention and legal compliance procedures, and conducting payment processing services) (the “Third Party Service Providers”). These Third Party Service Providers may be located in Singapore or outside of Singapore, and are under a duty of confidentiality to us and are only permitted to use your personal data in connection with the purposes specified in Section B above, and not for their own purposes.</p>
</li><li><p>The International Marketplace enables you to purchase or subscribe to products and services (“<strong>Marketplace Products</strong>”) from companies other than Alibaba Cloud (“<strong>Third Party Vendors</strong>”), and should you purchase or subscribe to Marketplace Products offered by a Third Party Vendor, we may provide such Third Party Vendor with your personal data for the purposes of processing your purchase and/or subscriptions on the International Marketplace. Other than such personal data disclosed by Alibaba Cloud to the Third Party Vendor, in some cases you may be required to submit personal data to Third Party Vendors to use such Marketplace Products. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such collection, use or disclosure of personal data by Third Party Vendors. The privacy policies of Third Party Vendors may differ from ours, and we have no control over the information that you submit to those Third Party Vendors. You should read the relevant privacy policies for those Third Party Vendors before providing your information to such Third Party Vendors.</p>
</li><li><p>We may share your personal data with affiliated companies in the Alibaba Group and/or their designated Service Providers, for the purposes specified at Section B above..</p>
</li><li><p>We may provide aggregated or anonymized data to third parties, but when we do so, the information we share is in a de-identified format that does not personally identify you.</p>
</li><li><p>We have established and will establish relationships with other parties and websites to offer you the benefit of their products and services. We offer you access to these other parties and their websites either through the use of hyperlinks to these sites from our Alibaba Cloud Platform or through offering “co-branded” sites in which both we and other parties share the same uniform resource locator, domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet, such as <a href="https://jp.alibabacloud.com/">https://jp.alibabacloud.com/</a>. In some cases you may be required to submit personal data to register or apply for products or services provided by such third parties or co-branded partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these third party sites or co-branded sites. The privacy policies of those other parties may differ from ours, and we have no control over the information that you submit to those third parties. You should read the relevant privacy policy for those third party sites and co-branded sites before responding to any offers, products or services advertised by those parties.</p>
</li><li><p>Our website offers publicly accessible community forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be accessed, read, collected, and used by others anywhere in the world. To request removal of your personal data from our community forums, contact us at <a href="http://mailto:intlcompliance@service.aliyun.com" title="intlcompliance@service.aliyun.com">intlcompliance@service.aliyun.com</a>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>D. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>As part of providing you with the Cloud Services, we may need to transfer your personal data from your jurisdiction to an overseas jurisdiction. Recipients of the data in these jurisdictions may be subject to data privacy laws less protective or not equivalent to those in your own jurisdiction. Such overseas transfer or processing of your personal data  may be necessary to process and administer your customer account and to provide the Cloud Services (including providing customer services to you, contacting you regarding promotions, products and services, performing risk control, fraud prevention and legal compliance procedures, and conducting payment processing services). You appoint us to perform any such transfer of personal data to any such country and to store and process such personal data in order to provide our Cloud Services to you. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with any laws or regulatory obligations relating to personal data and/or privacy and your use of the same on or in connection with the Cloud Services, and you warrant that you have obtained all requisite consents from all relevant data subjects to permit the use of the same.</p>

<p><strong>E. SECURITY MEASURES</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>We use commercially reasonable endeavors to protect the personal data that you provide to us. We also employ several security techniques, including but not limited to the use of industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for transmission of personal data in registration information and payment information and the adoption of identity, credential and access management measures for transmission of such personal data to prevent security breaches and unauthorized access of personal data. We limit access to your personal data and other data to people who need to access to such data for their work.</p>
</li><li><p>Nevertheless, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee security in connection with your use of the Alibaba Cloud Platform and our Cloud Services.</p>
</li><li><p>We retain your personal data as long as you have an account with us, as needed to provide services or products to you, to resolve disputes, or as required or permitted by applicable laws, such as tax and accounting laws. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>F. RIGHT TO ACCESS/CORRECT PERSONAL DATA; CONTACTING US</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request access to your personal data held by us (or on our behalf) and to request correction or deletion of such personal data.  Additionally, upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold your personal information. You may contact us at intlcompliance@service.aliyun.com to request access, correction or deletion of your personal data. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

<p><strong>H. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated by us posting an amended Privacy Policy on our Alibaba Cloud Platform. Once posted on our Alibaba Cloud Platform the new Privacy Policy will become immediately effective. We may also in our discretion provide notice to you of any changes to the Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. Any information and/or personal data we hold about you (as described in this Privacy Policy and whether or not collected prior to or after the amended and restated Policy comes into effect) will be governed by the latest version of our Privacy Policy. We strongly encourage you to visit the Alibaba Cloud Platform from time to time to review the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Alibaba Cloud Platform and/or the Cloud Services signifies your acceptance of the changes to the Privacy Policy. </p>
<p><strong>AUSTRALIA ADDENDUM</strong></p>
<p>If you are located in Australia, you acknowledge that Alibaba Cloud (Singapore) Private Limited is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this Privacy Policy, or how we handle your personal information, please contact our General Counsel at the address for “Outside the EEA” set forth in Part F above, who will review your complaint and respond within a reasonable period.  If you are dissatisfied with the handling of your complaint or concern, you may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner:</p>
<p>Office of the Australian Information Commissioner<br>GPO Box 5218<br>Sydney NSW 2001<br>Telephone: 1300 363 992<br>Email: enquiries@oaic.gov.au</p>
<p><strong>EEA ADDENDUM</strong></p>
<p>This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you are located in the EEA and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud is the controller of personal data only when it collects personal data and determines the purposes and means of processing that personal data.  For example, when customers of our Cloud Services register an account with us or provide contact information in order to receive customer support, we are the controller of that data.  When customers host their own services on our Cloud Services, we act as a data processor with respect to that data. </p>
<p>Our business may require us to transfer your personal data to countries outside of the EEA, including to countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country, such as the United States, Singapore and China. We take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your personal data are bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as standard contractual clauses. A copy of those clauses can be obtained by contacting us at intlcompliance@service.aliyun.com.</p>
<p>You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.</p>            </article>
