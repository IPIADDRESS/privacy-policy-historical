Personally identifiable information also includes information about your transactions or relationship with us if you have been a customer or you have provided this type of information to any of the CEVO family of companies. If you participate in any of our events, in addition to your name and contact information, Personal Information also includes your billing address, shipping address, event registration information, your Pay Pal information and your CEVO registration number.</p>

<h3>User Consent</h3>

<p>By submitting Personal Information through the Site and/or by downloading and using the Software, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. Because of its importance and to make it easier for you to find and review it, we have made this Privacy Statement into a separate document on the Site. However, bear in mind it is a part of our agreement with you, and the Terms describe how and when we may make changes to these statements and terms, and how they become binding upon you. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page. We encourage you to check the page regularly as you will be bound by the changes once posted.</p>

<h3>Our Commitment</h3>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Keeping the information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use and maintain your information is important to us.

We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.

<h3>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</h3>

<p>As you navigate our Website or use the Site, certain information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. When you enter the Site, we collect your browser type and IP address. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to the Site. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly.</p>

<p>We also use cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and viewed. This type of information is collected to better understand how you use our community and make the community and the Site we provide more useful to you.</p>

<p>BY REGISTERING WITH CEVO, YOU AGREE TO DOWNLOAD AND RUN THE SOFTWARE AND ALLOW IT TO SCAN YOUR COMPUTER'S GAMING ENVIRONMENT FOR THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS AND FILES. YOU ALSO AGREE TO ALLOW ALL THE DATA THAT THE SOFTWARE CAPTURES TO BE SENT TO OUR CONTENT SERVERS.

THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL SPYWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER AND WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH YOUR HARDDRIVE OR ANY FILES CONTAINED ON YOUR COMPUTER. When you use the Software, we collect information about the computer on which the Software is executed, including without limitation, the hardware address of its network adapter.</p>

We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate the site, enhance and improve our service, improve the look of the site and display advertising and marketing information.</p>

<p>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.</p>

<p>We may also contract with third parties in order to promote the products and/or services of these third parties by placing ads on the Site . We may use information posted by registered users to tailor the display of ads to the interest of users.

In such instances, we will make every effort to keep your personally identifiable information complete, up to date, and accurate based on the information you provide us.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>

<p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties unless the information is collected while operating an event for a third party, or you ask or authorize us to do so. We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the Site and to help us communicate with other users. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (expect pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant).

You can tell when another company is involved in a service provided on the Site, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that service.</li>

<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, the Terms or any of our guidelines for promotions, events or any other features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of CEVO, its sponsors, affiliates,  suppliers, advertisers, other customers or users, or any other party.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, Site users, or third parties.</p>

Often these third party advertising companies employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other web sites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours, and even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information and we encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.
