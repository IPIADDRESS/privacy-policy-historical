<b>HOW ALABAMA LIVE USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</b>: This site does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.  Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment. A user's personally identifiable information
may be used by Alabama Live, LLC and its affiliates for editorial
purposes.  Alabama Live, LLC may also use such information for
marketing and promotional purposes. Alabama Live, LLC may share
your personally identifiable information with other companies
with which it conducts business.  For example, if you enter our
contests, make a purchase, or use our e-mail services, we sometimes
rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In
such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information
to them. We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers,
so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While
Alabama Live, LLC will seek to require such third parties to follow
appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use
this information except for the express purpose for which it was
provided, Alabama Live, LLC does not bear any responsibility for
any actions or policies of any third parties.

research and statistical purposes.  For example, we might report
to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between
the ages of 30-35.
</p><p>
Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose
personally identifiable information  (e.g., first and last name,
address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas,
that information can be collected and used by others and may result
in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
