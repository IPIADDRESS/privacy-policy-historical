<div><h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: November 25, 2015</p>
<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you when you visit our websites, use our mobile applications, shop at our stores, use our products, access our services, participate in our programs, or otherwise interact with us. It also describes how we use and disclose the information we collect, how we protect information from unauthorized use or disclosure, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use of such information. Additional practices or terms may apply to special offers, promotions, contests or specific services, such as those provided by our pharmacies. You should also refer to any separate notices we provide regarding those terms or practices.</p>
<p><strong>CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>By accessing our website to obtain information or services; by providing solicited or unsolicited personal information to us online, at any of our retail locations, or through one of our mobile applications (“apps”); by enrolling in one of our customer loyalty or other programs, or through other means, you are consenting to our use of such information, subject to applicable laws, and agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We define the term “personal information” to mean any information that we directly associate with, or use to identify, a specific person. This may include information such as an address, phone number, email address, or fax number; a user name or other online registration information; a financial account or credit card number, and transaction information or purchase history, when associated with a person’s name. Personal information does not include “aggregated information,” which is information that we collect about a group or category of persons or services. It also does not include “de-identified information,” which is information from which we or our agents have removed any information that can be used to specifically identify a person. This policy does not restrict or limit our collection, use, or disclosure of aggregated or de-identified information.</p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We may collect your personal and other information described below in various ways, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Information You Provide. We may request, or give you the opportunity to provide, personal information when you register as a user of our website or one of our mobile applications, shop online or in our stores, sign up for our programs, offers, or sweepstakes, take one of our surveys, use our products or services, cash a check, contact us about a prior purchase, or email, call, or otherwise communicate with us. Similarly, if you contact us regarding a product or service that you are interested in or concerned about, we may request that you provide personal information that will enable us to respond to your inquiry.</li>
<li>Automatically Collected Information. When you shop online or in our stores or register for or use any of our online, mobile or other services, transactional and other information, such as the date of your purchase, registration, or service usage, their descriptions and, if applicable, the dollar amount or value of the transaction, your Internet protocol address, browser type, domain names, access times, operating systems, mouse clicks and movements, and scrolling activities may be collected automatically or “passively” by us or by one or more of our third party service providers. For example, we may use third-party analytics tools that collect information about use of our websites and user traffic. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to other information that may identify you.</li>
<li>Location Information. If you use one of our mobile applications and your mobile device’s settings allow it, we may collect information about your real-time location. You may adjust the settings on your<br>mobile device to allow or prevent the sharing of location information. For example, you can disable “Location” (or “Location Services” on iOS-based devices) on your mobile device to prevent sharing your location information with us. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your mobile device to learn how to adjust your mobile device settings. Please note that if you disable the sharing of location information, you may be unable to access some features of our services that are designed for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Mobile Device Information. We may also collect mobile device information using beaconing technology, such as: the device type, model and operating system version, and current IP address. We do not use this technology to collect personal information such as name, mobile telephone number, or email address. To disable our ability to identify your mobile device, you can delete our app, adjust the in-app settings, or turn your Bluetooth to “off” on your device.</li>
<li>Other Information. We may obtain information about you from third parties such as demographic marketing information, address verification, or mailing list information and combine it with other personal information pertaining to you.</li>
<li>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies. MyWebGrocer is a third party service provider we use to host some of our websites and also to provide content on some of our websites that are not hosted by them. We and/or MyWebGrocer may use cookies, web beacons, Uniform Resource Locators (URL), and similar technologies to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track information about you and your activities online at our websites over time and across third-party websites or online services including, but not limited to, your computer’s Internet protocol address and operating system, your browser type, the site from which you linked to our site, the time and date of your visit, how you use our services, and what products and services you purchase. In addition, we may use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and how you interact with our websites and mobile applications. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience, store items in your online shopping cart between visits, and analyze the use of our services and solutions to make them more useful to you. These technologies also allow us to aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information, which may or may not include personal information, and provide this information to our service providers.<br>We and/or MyWebGrocer may also link this information with other personal information about you and may use this linked information to allow third parties to serve ads on our websites or mobile applications or to serve our ads to you on a third party’s website. If you “click through” to or otherwise visit third-party websites, they may also collect information about you and your visit. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of MyWebGrocer or other third parties that collect your personal information. For additional information on the privacy practices of MyWebGrocer, please click here. We also encourage you to check the privacy policies of other third parties whose information you find on our website to learn about their practices with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Internet browsers allow you to remove or manage cookie functions and adjust your privacy and security preferences. For information on how to do this, access the “help” menu on your Internet browser. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove Flash cookies. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, please visit Adobe’s website. Please note, however, that disabling our cookies may result in your inability to take full advantage of all of the features of our services.<br>We also offer AdChoices on some of our websites which provides you with the ability to opt out of certain third party services that may involve tracking. For more information, click on the AdChoices link listed under “About This Site” on our websites that offer this service.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</strong><br>Currently, our web servers do not recognize or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. Our websites and mobile applications may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> We may use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to your requests or inquiries.</li>
<li>Processing and completing your transactions including, as applicable, order confirmation, billing, enrollment in our loyalty or other programs, and delivering products or services.</li>
<li>Providing you with newsletters, articles, product or service alerts, new product or service announcements, savings awards, event invitations, and other information.</li>
<li>Contacting you about programs, products, or services that we believe may be of interest to you, or sharing with you special offers from other companies.</li>
<li>Providing you with personally tailored coupons, programs, promotional information, and offers.</li>
<li>Conducting market research, surveys, and similar inquiries to help us understand trends and customer needs across product categories or customer groups.</li>
<li>Analyzing transactions or purchase histories to present customized offers to you or to improve our products, services, programs, and other offerings.</li>
<li>Evaluating your shopping experience or existing products and services, or to create new items.</li>

<li>Verifying and validating your identity.</li>
<li>Keeping a record of our interactions with you if you place an order or otherwise deal with our representatives over the telephone or online.</li>
<li>Preventing, investigating, or providing notice of fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, or unauthorized access to or use of personal information, our website or data systems; or to meet legal obligations.</li>
<li>Enforcing our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of our business, nor do we disclose to them the personal information we collect for their own direct marketing purposes. However, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, we may disclose or transfer your personal information as described under the “Certain Business Transfers” section below. We may also share your personal information with our parent or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described in the “Our Use of Personal Information” section above. Though not an exhaustive list, our most common practices with respect to the disclosure of personal information are described below.</p>
<ul>
