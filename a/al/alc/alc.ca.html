<p><strong>1.0 Policy Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br></strong>The Atlantic Lottery Corporation (AL) will pursue and implement reasonable protection measures for the prevention and the reduction of risky behaviour in the electronic service delivery environment. <br><br><strong>2.0 Goals of the Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This policy provides AL with the appropriate responsiveness to successfully and safely maintain electronic service delivery within its jurisdiction, while achieving the level of integrity that earns trust and respect from players as well as non-gambling audiences. <br><br>AL strives to present the best possible balanced environment for electronic service delivery (internet) to satisfy the broadest player base. Within best-known practices and information, AL makes certain to: <br><br>• Maintain an entertainment experience that focuses on harmless fun. <br>• Enable players to make informed gaming decisions. <br>• Provide proactive features to reduce the likelihood of a player developing harmful gambling behaviours and reduce the ability for a player to abuse play. <br>• Promote responsible use of AL products. Continuously enhance the public’s trust in AL’s integrity. <br><br><strong>3.0 Player Protection </strong></p>
<strong><p>In keeping with its mission, vision and values, AL has implemented reasonable player protection measures and strategies aimed at reducing possible problem gambling risks. These strategies are based on best available knowledge related to problem identification and risk reduction, and employs player protection concepts consistent with the capabilities of the gaming system and play environment. <br><br><strong>4.0 Mandatory Controls</strong></p>
</strong><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>AL acknowledges its corporate role in problem gambling risk management and has established, and from time to time will review specific wagering, deposit and behaviour controls to address or mitigate the potential for harmful player behaviour. <br><br><strong>5.0 Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All individual player activity is strictly confidential. AL relies on transparent and confidential system responses in initiating player protection features. Limited exceptions are in strict accordance with the AL’s Internet Privacy Policy. <br><br><strong>6.0 Modifiability</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As changes in knowledge and prevention concepts become known, AL has the right to evaluate, test or implement such changes. This policy does not require an indefinite continuation of protection features or concepts, and equally does not require an adoption of new or evolving concepts.</p>
