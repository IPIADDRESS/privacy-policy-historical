The following describes the information we may collect, how we use it, how you

<b>1. The Information We Collect<br>
</b>ALC offers features contained within ALC.ca that require the collection, 
maintenance and use of some personal information. The following pieces of

and is used to distribute e-mail services to which you have subscribed. <br>
<br>
<b>Name, Address, Phone Number, Credit Card Information (optional) and Date of 
Birth<br>
</b>This information will be used to identify you on ALC.ca, to ensure that you are

offered through our website, we maintain your answers and/or any opinions or 
information that you volunteer.</p><p>
Your submission to survey questions is used to accumulate survey results, which 
may be published in aggregate form (i.e., your submission is not associated with 
you as an individual). We may use your response to improve products, services or 
our website. 
</p><p>
Contest entry information is collected, retained and used as described in the 
contest terms and conditions.</p><p>
<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>3. Sharing the Information<br>
</b>ALC sometimes retains outside organizations to perform specialized services such 
as data processing, verification of residency and age of majority requirements 
and customer services. Our trusted service suppliers may at times be responsible 
for processing and handling some of the information we receive from you.
</p><p>
Suppliers who provide specialized services for ALC are given only the 
information necessary to perform those services and are prohibited from using 
that information for purposes other than to carry out the service they have been 
contracted to provide. ALC protects customerâs personal information disclosed to 
third parties by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the 
information and the purpose for which it is to be used. ALC takes appropriate 
steps to ensure that our suppliers provide a comparable level of protection 
while your personal information is in their possession.
</p><p>
At no time will your personal information be shared or sold to third parties for 
any purpose other than disclosed to you.</p><p>
<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>4. Cookies and Statistics<br>
</b>Cookies are small text files that identify an individual computerâs browser 
entering a website. They allow the website to ârememberâ certain pieces of 
information as the individual moves through it and enhance the overall 
experience with the site. Through cookies, a website can facilitate a userâs 
access to, and use of, the site. ALC uses cookies only for the above-mentioned 
purposes and will not use them to personally identify users unless consent to do 
so is specifically obtained.
</p><p>
For certain services to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If 
you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you 
are visiting other websites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify 
you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability of accepting or 
rejecting any cookie presented by the server of the website you are visiting. 
The site will work if you choose to reject cookies, but some functionality will 
not be available to you.</p><p>
When you go to information portions of our website and move from page to page, 
read pages or download content onto your computer, we learn about which pages 
are visited and what content is downloaded. However, none of this is associated 
with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate form. 
</p><p>
We use this information to find out how many people visit our website and which 
sections of the site are visited most frequently. This helps us to know what 
type of information is most useful to you so that we can improve our website and 
make it easier for you to access information.</p><p>
<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>5. Our Commitment to Security<br>
</b>Personal information about you will only be accessible to authorized ALC 
employees and representatives who require access to this information in the 
performance of their duties.
</p><p>
ALC maintains security standards, systems and procedures to help prevent 
unauthorized access to, or loss or misuse of, confidential information about 
you. Our technology is routinely updated and tested to improve the protection of 
our information about you and to assure the integrity of our information.</p><p>

			<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>Advertising</b><br>
			2. No person shall advertise or use the name, trademark, official marks and 
			logos of the Corporation or any other characteristics used to identify a 
			lottery without the written authorization of the Corporation.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Sale of Tickets</b><br>
			3. Tickets may be sold to the public by the Corporation throughout the Atlantic 
			provinces or by a retailer within the place or area where such retailer is 
			authorized, but the Corporation, may at any time and at its discretion, refuse 
			to issue tickets bearing any selection, or limit the number of selections that 
			may be made by or the number of tickets that may be sold to any person(s).
			<br>
			<br>
			4. Except as authorized by the Corporation, no ticket may be sold to the public 
			at a price other than that shown thereon.
			<br>
			<br>
			5. The Corporation may establish discounts or commissions with respect to the 
			sale of tickets to distributors and retailers within the Atlantic region.
			<br>
			<br>
			6. The sale of tickets to individuals under the age of majority in their 
			province of residence and the purchase of tickets by individuals under the 
			applicable age of majority are prohibited, and, subject to clause 15, prizes 
			related to such tickets will not be paid or awarded to anyone.
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>Draw</b><br>
			7. A draw in a lottery may be made by any method established by the Corporation 
			and may be held at such time and place as the Corporation determines.
			<br>
			<br>
			8. When a draw in a lottery cannot be held on the date fixed, such draw shall 
			be held as soon as practicable thereafter.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Irregular Tickets</b><br>
			9. <b>Any ticket</b>,
			<ol start="1" type="a">
				<li>
				other than a ticket awarded as a prize, for which payment has not been received 
				prior to the date on which it would have, but for such non-payment, become a 
				winning ticket
				</li><li>
				which is un-issued, altered, counterfeited, forged or produced in error, or 
				which is in any material manner illegible, mutilated, defective, misprinted, or 
				otherwise incomplete, or
				</li><li>
					which is issued by a computer terminal and i) which has been canceled by the 
					retailer, or ii) for which the computer entries have not been recorded or have 
					been lost as a result of a computer failure or otherwise, is void and shall not 
					in any case entitle its holder to a prize. A void ticket shall not entitle a 
					holder to a refund of the amount paid, if any, except where the Corporation is 
					able to determine, from the control number and other data appearing on such 
					ticket, that it is a ticket duly issued at the time where it is alleged to have 
					been issued and not subsequently canceled at the request of the holder. 
					Moreover, a ticket on which a spot bearing the words "void if removed" when 
					such a spot has in fact been removed or exposed in a manner such that any 
					portion of the number concealed under such spot has been exposed is void and 
					shall not entitle its holder in a prize nor to a refund of the amount paid, if 
					any.</li>
			</ol>
			10. Subject to the provisions of section 9 hereof, if any ticket issued by a 
			computer terminal bears entries that differ from the entries which are recorded 
			in the computer system under the control number appearing on such ticket, then 
			such ticket shall not be void, but shall conclusively be deemed to bear the 
			entries which are so recorded in the computer systems.
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>Payment 
				of Prizes</b><br>
			11. The Corporation has no obligation to pay or deliver a prize unless the 
			holder of a winning ticket
			<ol start="1" type="a">
				<li>
				gives the Corporation the right to publish his/her name, address and/or recent 
				photograph without any claim for broadcasting, printing, royalty, or other 
				rights;
				</li><li>
				if requested by the Corporation, gives satisfactory evidence of identification 
				and/or a valid release for the prize and undertakes to indemnify and save the 
				Corporation harmless from any further claims made by either such holder or by 
				any other person regarding such prize;
				</li><li>
				endorses the winning ticket or provides the Corporation with a duly attested 
				Power of Attorney allowing another person to endorse the winning ticket on 
				his/her behalf; and
				</li><li>
					upon request, satisfies the Corporation that he/she was the full age of 
					majority, according to the laws of the Province in which he/she resided, at the 
					time the winning ticket was purchased.</li>
			</ol>
			12. Retailers and distributors incur no liability toward anyone in the case of 
			acts of God, fortuitous events or force majeurs. In all other cases, whether 
			the liability is contractual or in tort or delictual, including negligence on 
			their part or that of their employees, the liability of retailers and 
			distributors is limited to the amount paid for the ticket.
			<br>
			<br>
			13. The Corporation incurs no liability toward anyone in the case of acts of 
			God, fortuitous events, or force majeurs. In all other cases whether the 
			liability is contractual or in tort or delictual, including negligence on its 
			part or that of its employees, the liability of the Corporation is limited, if 
			the claim is based on a valid winning ticket, to the cost to the Corporation of 
			the prize won with such ticket or otherwise, to the amount paid for the ticket.
			<br>
			<br>
			14. Except for money prizes, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, 
			substitute for any prize i) the cash equivalent to the Corporation's cost of 
			such prize or ii) a prize of any equivalent cost to the Corporation. No 
			representation or warranty as to the fitness and serviceability of any 
			merchandise or service prize is given or to be implied.
			<br>
			<br>
			15. An individual under the age of majority, according to the laws of the 
			Province in which he/she resided, may be entitled to a prize where it can be 
			established that the acquisition of the winning ticket did not contravene 
			section 6 above. The Corporation shall transfer or pay the prize to the legal 
			guardian on behalf of the holder of a winning ticket upon receiving a 
			satisfactory order from a Court of competent jurisdiction or, in the case of a 
			prize with a value of less than $1,000, upon receiving a satisfactory release 
			from his/her parent or legal guardian.
			<br>
			<br>
			<a href="#Top"><img src="Images/Top.gif" alt="Top" border="0" align="right"></a><b>Claims</b><br>
			16. No right of action exists against the Corporation with respect to any draw, 
			ticket or prize, unless the claimant:
			<ol start="1" type="a">
				<li>
				satisfies the Corporation that he/she is the holder of a valid ticket and, when 
				he/she claims a prize, that such ticket is a winning ticket, and that the 
				conditions of section 11 have been fulfilled; and
				</li><li>
					produces a written claim and such winning ticket to the Corporation prior to 
					the expiry of one (1) year commencing on the date of the draw or within the 
					time limit otherwise specified on the ticket, whichever is earliest</li>
			</ol>
			17. In the event of any dispute with regard to a prize, the Corporation may in 
			the case of money prize, pay the money into Court or as directed by the Court 
			and, in the case of any other prize, deliver the prize or evidence of 
			entitlement thereto to the Court pending determination of the matter by a Court 
			of competent jurisdiction.
			<br>
			<br>
			18. A person who makes claim for a prize is conclusively deemed to represent 
			and warrant to the Corporation that he/she is the person or holder lawfully 
			entitled to receive such prize, and such representation and warranty shall 
			survive the awarding of the prize.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>General</b><br>
			19. These rules and regulations apply to all lotteries conducted and managed 
			under the authority of the Corporation and all tickets issued under such 
			lotteries. The rules and regulations, the conditions and explanations appearing 
			on tickets and such other conditions as are established by the Corporation, 
			including, without restriction the generality of the foregoing, the conditions 
			appearing on selection forms and prize structure statements, constitute the 
			contractual rights and obligations with respect to lotteries. In the event of 
			any discrepancy or inconsistency between these rules and regulations and the 
			conditions and explanations appearing on a ticket or such other conditions as 
			are established by the Corporation, these rules and regulations shall prevail.
			<br>
			<br>
			20. The Corporation may from time to time amend these rules and regulations
			<br>
			<br>
			21. Where the context so requires, in these rules and regulations, the neuter 
			gender shall include the feminine or masculine gender and vice versa, and the 
			singular shall include the plural and vice versa.
			<br>
			<br>
22. In the event any provision of these rules and regulations, of the 
conditions and explanations appearing on a ticket or of such other conditions 
as are established by the Corporation are determined by a Court of competent 
jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such determination shall solely 
affect such provision and shall not, in itself, render void or unenforceable 
the remaining provisions thereof.
