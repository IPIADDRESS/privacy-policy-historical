<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to any information Alumniclass.com receives, collects and stores through our Websites and is incorporated into all other domains or Websites owned and operated by Alumniclass.com. Other domains or Websites owned by Alumniclass.com currently include: <a href="http://www.classyears.com">www.classyears.com</a>, <a href="http://www.reunionposts.org">www.reunionposts.org</a>, <a href="http://www.highschoolalumnireunion.com">www.highschoolalumnireunion.com</a>, <a href="http://www.reunionguidebook.com">www.reunionguidebook.com</a>, <a href="http://www.johnnyandran.com">www.johnnyandran.com</a>, <a href="http://www.pawzoom.com">www.pawzoom.com.</a>.   We intend to create more Websites.
</p>

<p>
Each Alumniclass.com Website may offer different features, functions, services and tools.  We share the information you provide between our Websites when you register or upload any content.  This privacy policy is Alumniclass.com's company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to any information and data we collect.
</p>

<a name="information"></a>

<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>
Alumniclass.com does not share your information with third-party solicitors unless you are a reunion coordinator or committee member seeking reunion planning information from outside sources. If you have a dispute regarding a reunion or purchase of reunion tickets your email address may be shared with the reunion coordinator in order to assist you with your dispute. Reunion related disputes are the responsibility of the reunion coordinator and by registering for a reunion or purchasing reunion related items you agree your email address may be shared with the reunion coordinator.
</p>

<p>
Alumniclass.com retains the right to use your information (e.g. your name, where you graduated from, your class year and any other information deemed necessary by Alumniclass.com) in promoting our Websites to other alumni, website members, users, schools or school districts, through communications such as electronic newsletters, emails, and other lawful means.
</p>

<p>
When you co-register with other websites, information may be shared between Alumniclass.com and the websites with whom you co-register.  This may include pre-populating our Websites with your information through the co-registration process.  Examples of co-registering may include, but are not limited to, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, and <strong>Pinterest</strong>. As with other social networking sites, the information you provide when you register and create your profile (e.g. your name, e-mail address, hobbies, occupation, marital status, work place, community affiliations, and similar information) on any of our Websites shall be maintained by Alumniclass.com and some or all of your information may be displayed on all Alumniclass.com Websites.  Information we display on our Websites will not include your email address.  Although e-mail addresses are often required, you may not be required to verify your email address to become a member.  If you provide an invalid email address, you will not receive email notifications. 
</p>

<p>
Members are given the option to submit more detailed information about themselves, including their maiden name, city in which they reside, birthday, marital status, and activities in which they participate. Because this information is publicly displayed on our Websites, it may appear in the results of searches conducted through Internet search engines while you are a member of our Websites and potentially for some time after your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.  Because this information is public, it may be included on third-party websites and devices and your geographic location may also be displayed based upon the Zip Code you provide, mapping, community affiliations, to assist members and visitors to the websites with a tool to help find people.
</p>

<p>
The Alumniclass.com Websites where your information may be shared and publicly displayed include, but are not limited to, <a href="http://www.classyears.com">www.classyears.com</a>, <a href="http://www.reunionposts.org">www.reunionposts.org</a>, <a href="http://www.highschoolalumnireunion.com">www.highschoolalumnireunion.com</a>, <a href="http://www.reunionguidebook.com">www.reunionguidebook.com</a>, <a href="http://www.johnnyandran.com">www.johnnyandran.com</a>, <a href="http://www.pawzoom.com">www.pawzoom.com.</a>.

</p>

<p>
When you or any member sends emails through the website's internal email system, the website is designed to hide email addresses to protect the privacy of both the sender and the receiver.
