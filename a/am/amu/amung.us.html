	Data is collected in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Free widget services:</b><br>
        You will not be required to provide any personally identifiable 
        information, or any information at all, should you choose to install one 
        of our free widgets on your website in order to utilize our statistics 
        services. You, and any user who visits a website containing a whos.amung.us Inc. free
        widget, will be providing an IP address, page URL reference(s), and browser/operating
        system information in the request header. This is a standard HTTP request header
        and is available freely to the operator of any website you choose to visit. We, and/or our partners, may
        log certain aspects of this header and/or data as part of our services. We, and/or our partners, may log
        certain aspects of the content where our widgets are installed, as well as non-personally
        identifiable actions users may take on these sites/pages (such as a copy action).
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li><b>Subscription based Pro widget service:</b><br>
        In order to effectively provide our subscription based Pro service we require

        log certain aspects of this header and other information collected via Javascript 
        as part of our services, no personally identifiable information is collected,

        and/or other business relationship with whos.amung.us Inc. will be
        required to provide any necessary personally identifiable information
        in order to complete the business transaction/relationship. This information
        may include, but is not limited to: names, addresses, phone numbers, 
        server information, email addresses, trademarks and copyrights used in

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Privacy Policy Requirements</strong>
	<br>
	By using any of our services you agree to have and abide by an appropriate privacy policy and 
	will comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection of information from visitors to your website(s).
	It is your responsibility to take any action required to uphold regulatory requirements and inform your users adequately 
	that your website(s) use third party technology and cookies that assist in collection and sharing of anonymous NPII for the purpose
	of analytics and advertising. You must post a privacy policy and that policy must provide notice of your use of cookie(s) and/or services 
	that collects anonymous (non personally identifiable) traffic data. You may wish to add a link to the whos.amung.us
	privacy policy (this page) in order to improve transparency and empower user's choice, where an opt out mechanism is made available.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>IP Address Usage:</strong>
	<br>
	Every computer and device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. 
	Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country, region and city 
	from which a computer is connecting to the Internet. Like other web traffic analytic service providers, whos.amung.us collects 
	the IP address of website visitors in order to provide website owners with a general idea of where in the world their visitors come from, this is 
	known as geolocation. Regardless of a website owners usage of whos.amung.us, or other analytic services, they have access to IP addresses for
	visitors to their website(s).
</p>
<p>
