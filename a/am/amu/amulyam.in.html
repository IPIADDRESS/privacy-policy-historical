            <p align="left"> Amulyam.in, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy   applies to Amulyam.in and governs data collection and usage including   Amulyam website and email services.                                                                       This   Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new   registering members. </p>
            <p align="left"> We   firmly believe that both our Members and our clients benefit because we   market only to people who have given us express permission to do so. </p>
            <p align="left"> While the word "privacy" may mean different things to different people,   we believe that once you understand how we use your information, the   steps we take to protect it, and the resulting benefit to you, you will   not only feel confident when sharing information with us, but will also   find your participation in the program a most rewarding experience. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Collection of Information </strong></p>
            <p align="left">Amulyam collects both personal and non-personal information using the   methods listed below. Our primary purpose in collecting such information   is to provide you with a personalized Amulyam experience by displaying   content and delivering offers that are likely to be of interest to you   according to your preferences. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Information Collected at Registration </strong></p>
            <p align="left">To take advantage of the offers available at Amulyam, you must register   for our service and become a Amulyam Member. Amulyam collects personal   information when you register with us and when you use Amulyam services.   Amulyam may combine information about you that we have with information   we obtain from business partners or companies. During registration, we   require members to give us basic contact information (such as your first   name, last name ,e-mail address and mobile number), demographic   information (such as your zip code, age and gender) and personal   information(education,profession,marital status). The registration form   information requests may change from time to time. Although additional   demographic information may be requested at the time of registration,   only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and   utilization of our services. Once you register with Amulyam, you are not   anonymous to us.<br>
                <br>
            We   do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. The   Amulyam Program is available only to persons who are eighteen years of   age and over. The site will automatically block enrollment of any person   once they indicate they are under the age of eighteen. If we later   learn that a user is under the age of eighteen, we will terminate the   account and delete the user's information. Inherent in the Program is   the responsibility of parents and/or guardians to ensure that their   children's privacy is protected. Amulyam.in will not be liable for any   content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the   terms of this agreement.</p>
            
            <p align="left"><strong>Information Collected through Participation in the Amulyam Program </strong></p>
            <p align="left">When you sign in to the Amulyam website, the server automatically   recognizes you by your cookie. This cookie acts as a unique identifier,   which allows us to personalize the website to your specified interests   and allows you to access your personal information. It also allows us to   keep track of your activity on our site and allows us to properly   credit Incentives to your account. This information may be added to your   personal profile and used to deliver offers and advertisements that are   most relevant to your interests.<br>
                <br>
            The   program makes active use of third-party cookies; therefore, full   participation in the Program is dependent upon you setting your browser   configuration to accept third-party cookies. We also use cookies to   tailor the program to your interests and, most importantly, to ensure   that only you can access your account. We also review "log-file" data to   monitor site performance and analyze traffic patterns and usage of our   site.</p>
            <p align="left">Amulyam also retrieves the following information from your browser:<br>
                
                </p><ul style="text-align:left; list-style: circle">
                    
                    <li>Your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer)</li>
                    <li>Platform-dependent information (e.g., Windows)</li>
                    <li>Requested document (the page you're looking at)</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL (the page you came from if within the Amulyam.in site)</li>
                    <li>Date and time of your visit</li>
                    <li>Your registered Amulyam account information</li>
                    
                    <li>Purchase transaction detail (from merchants on the Amulyam.in site)</li>
                    <li>IP   address associated with member transaction in the system</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
            <p></p>
            <p>Additionally, for each visitor to our website, our server automatically   recognizes the following:<br>
                
                </p><ul style="text-align:left; list-style: circle">
                    <li>Host origin of the request (your IP address or that of your ISP if using   proxy servers)</li>

                    <li>Referrer URL (the page you came from if within the Amulyam.in site)</li>
                    
                    <li>Your registered Amulyam. account information</li>
                    <li>Date and time of your visit</li>
                </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p align="left">This information, sometimes called log-file or clickstream data, is used   to monitor site performance and ensure the Program functions properly.   It may also be appended to your personal profile so that we may further   tailor the Program to your interests.<br>
                Many   of Amulyam advertisers, shopping affiliates and merchants also utilize   third-party cookies to identify you as a Amulyam member. This enables   them to report your purchases back to Amulyam so we are able to credit   your account with Incentive Money.<br>
                We   and our advertisers currently use third-party cookies and clear pixel   GIFs (also referred to as "web beacons") to measure page views on both   Amulyam and advertisers' web sites and email responses. These devices   allow us to identify unique visitors to Amulyam' site, member visits to   advertisers' sites, and act as a counter for ongoing monitoring of site,   email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a   specific offer for both Amulyam.in and its advertisers. These commonly   used counters collect absolutely no personal information and, as always,   this technology is only used to enhance the program and make it more   relevant to your personal interests.<br>
                
                <br>
            Third-party cookies are also used to count unique page views, email   responses and future transaction activity corresponding to specific   offers. Amulyam will also capture and store your transaction details,   which may include the items and quantities purchased, purchase price,   date and time of purchase. This information is used to credit Incentive   Money for free mobile recharge and movie tickets and to adjust your   account balance in the event of returns and exchanges. This information   is also used by the Member Services department while assisting you in   resolving account inquiries. We may also use your transaction   information to provide you more timely relevant offers, products and   services.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Information Collected Via Online Surveys, Sweepstakes and Other Promotions 	</strong></p>
            <p align="left">From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in   contests, sweepstakes or surveys. If you choose to participate, we will   request certain personally identifiable information from you.   Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and   you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to disclose this   information. The requested information typically includes contact   information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic   information (such as gender and zip code).<br>
                <br>
                We   use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes. We may   also use the information gathered to better personalize your Amulyam   program experience.<br>
                <br>
            We   may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys,   contests and sweepstakes. That company is prohibited from using your   personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not   share the personally identifiable information you provide through a   contest, sweepstakes or survey with any third party unless we give you   prior notice and choice.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information </strong></p>
            
            <p align="left">We do not rent or sell your personal information to anyone without your   express consent. When we do share data with our advertisers it is in   aggregate form and is designed to ensure you are not identified   personally. In order to provide you with information about offers and   services you have indicated an interest in, we may provide certain of   your personal information to specific advertisers to allow them to   provide information about the offer or service to you in the most   convenient and meaningful form. Also, by participating in an   advertiser's offer, you are authorizing us to share your relevant   personal information with the advertiser responsible for the offer. In   the event either we or a participating advertiser are unable to capture   your transaction detail, we may need to provide certain of your personal   information to the advertiser to validate your transaction with them to   ensure that your account is credited with the correct Incentive Money.   However, before any personal information is provided to an advertiser   for any such purpose, the advertiser will be contractually bound to   observe the strict requirements of the Amulyam Privacy Policy.<br>
                <br>
                Amulyam engages in email and direct mail marketing. Because email is an   integral part of the program, you sign up to receive email targeted to   your interests at the time of registration. If you later decide you wish   to cease participation in this portion of the program, you may do so at   any time on this page: <a href="http://www.amulyam.in/dsUnSubscribe.do">http://www.amulyam.in/dsUnSubscribe.do</a>.   To further ensure we have your consent, we make sure each e-mail we   send you contains an additional opportunity to "opt out" of receiving   future e-mails. If you are not interested in receiving either e-mail or   direct mail marketing, you may choose to opt out from receiving the   e-mail or close your membership.<br>
                <br>
                Although we house our data in Canada, it is possible that some of our   data processing may occur outside of Canada. While the data protection   laws of these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort   to protect your information based upon the express terms of this Privacy   Policy. By enrolling in the program, you consent to this transfer of   your personal data.<br>
                <br>
                As   long as you remain a Amulyam member, opting not to receive email does   not exempt you from receiving administrative emails, which include, but   are not limited to, notices about vital program and membership status   changes or alterations to our Terms of Service.<br>
                
            <strong>Member Communications and Email</strong></p>
            <p align="left">Amulyam employs a strict policy against sending unsolicited email.   Because email is an integral part of the program, you sign up to receive   email targeted to your interests at the time of enrollment. If you   later decide you wish to cease participation in this portion of the   program, you may do so at any time by clicking on the opt-out links   contained within each amulyam email or by sending an email to   unsubscribe@amulyam.com.<br>
                <br>
                Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from   receiving administrative emails that include but are not limited to,   notices about vital program and membership status changes, Privacy   Policy and Terms of Service updates and purchase and redemption   confirmation emails.<br>
                <br>
                Members may also receive Amulyam program offers via SMS. We contact you   with offers we think you are interested in. Members may opt out of of   these communications by sending a request to unsubscribe@amulyam.com.<br>
                <br>
                Our   Member Services Department may contact you in response to your   inquiries, to provide services at your request and to manage your   account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone or fax in   accordance with your wishes.<br>
            <strong>Amulyam Advertisers and 3rd Party Websites</strong></p>
            
            <p align="left">The Amulyam website and emails contain links to various other sites.   While Amulyam makes every effort to ensure that our advertisers post   clear and complete Privacy Policies and observe appropriate data   practices, each of these sites has a privacy policy that may differ from   that of Amulyam. The privacy practices of other websites and companies   are not covered by this policy.<br>
                <br>
                Amulyam may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad   networks, to display advertisements on the Amulyam website or in Amulyam   email. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your   computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time   they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may   compile information about where you, or others who are using your   computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked   on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted   advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.   Amulyam does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be   placed by these parties on your computer, and has no control over these   parties' privacy policies or information collection practices.<br>
                <br>
                Except as specifically set forth below, it is our policy not to provide   your personally identifiable information to our advertisers unless you   make the choice to share it with them. We occasionally pass personally   identifiable information via a secure interface to certain of our   advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for   their offers. However, this information is only to be used by the   advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the advertiser for   the purposes of completing an offer.<br>
                <br>
                We   occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our   behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings,   providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing   statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those   companies the personal information they need to deliver the service.   They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information   and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
                <br>
                In   the event that we were unable to capture your transaction detail,   Amulyam may need to validate your transaction with an advertiser or   merchant partner to ensure that your account is credited with the   correct Incentive Amount. The validation information shared is used   solely for this purpose and may include your first name, last name,   email address, mailing address or date of birth. We will require that   these third parties comply with the information practices set forth in   this Privacy Promise and that the information not be shared or used for   any other purpose.<br>
                <br>
                
                We   may share non-personally identifiable information collected via the   program in aggregate, anonymous form with advertisers or other third   parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are   most appealing to different segments of our member base. We do not   disclose your first name, last name, address, email address, or any   other personally identifiable information to these third parties unless   you give your express consent.<br>
                <br>
                We   occasionally send the information we gather about our members to trusted   third-party data processors to organize, process and/or analyze the   data on our behalf. We use this information to enhance our program   offerings, namely to tailor advertisements, updates, and offers to your   particular interests and to ensure that your opt-out requests are   honored. All such third-party data processors are prohibited from using   your personal information except to provide these services to Amulyam.   They are contractually bound to observe the strict policy stated herein,   so you can rest assured that the confidentiality of your personally   identifiable information will be maintained.<br>
            <strong>Data Verification and Supplementation</strong></p>
            <p align="left">Data verification involves the use of third-party data processing   services to standardize and clean your provided enrollment information   so that it is easily identified and accessed in our database. Data   supplementation involves appending any publicly available information   about you to your personal profile.<br>
                <br>
                In   order to provide you with the most rewarding experience, we might send   your information to data processors so that they can clean your address   and standardize to ensure it is most accurate and up-to-date. Next, we   might seek out any information about you that is publicly available on   the open market and overlay this data onto ours for comparison purposes.   Information collected in this manner could include your spending habits   from a mail-order catalogue, demographic information you provided in   entering a sweepstakes, or your financial history. All of this results   in a program that is tailored to your personal interests and provides   you with the most relevant Point-earning opportunities.<br>
                <br>
                We   use this information solely for the purpose of enhancing the offerings   of the Amulyam Program, namely to tailor advertisements, updates, and   Incentive-earning and spending offers to your particular interests. All   such third-party data processors are contractually bound to observe the   strict policy stated herein, so you can rest assured that the   confidentiality of your personal information will be maintained.<br>
