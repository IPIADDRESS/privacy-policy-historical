Amulyam collects personal information when you register with us and when you use Amulyam services. Amulyam may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or companies. During registration, we require members to give us basic contact information (such as your first name, last name ,e-mail address and mobile number), demographic information (such as your zip code, age and gender) and personal information(education,profession,marital status). The registration form information requests may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services. Once you register with Amulyam, you are not anonymous to us.<br><br>

The Amulyam Program is available only to persons who are eighteen years of age and over. The site will automatically block enrollment of any person once they indicate they are under the age of eighteen. If we later learn that a user is under the age of eighteen, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information. Inherent in the Program is the responsibility of parents and/or guardians to ensure that their children's privacy is protected. Amulyam.in will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this agreement.<br><br>

This enables them to report your purchases back to Amulyam so we are able to credit your account with Incentive Money.<br>

These devices allow us to identify unique visitors to Amulyam' site, member visits to advertisers' sites, and act as a counter for ongoing monitoring of site, email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a specific offer for both Amulyam.in and its advertisers. These commonly used counters collect absolutely no personal information and, as always, this technology is only used to enhance the program and make it more relevant to your personal interests.<br><br>

Amulyam will also capture and store your transaction details, which may include the items and quantities purchased, purchase price, date and time of purchase. This information is used to credit Incentive Money for free mobile recharge and movie tickets and to adjust your account balance in the event of returns and exchanges. This information is also used by the Member Services department while assisting you in resolving account inquiries. We may also use your transaction information to provide you more timely relevant offers, products and services.<br><br>

We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest, sweepstakes or survey with any third party unless we give you prior notice and choice.<br><br>

When we do share data with our advertisers it is in aggregate form and is designed to ensure you are not identified personally. In order to provide you with information about offers and services you have indicated an interest in, we may provide certain of your personal information to specific advertisers to allow them to provide information about the offer or service to you in the most convenient and meaningful form. Also, by participating in an advertiser's offer, you are authorizing us to share your relevant personal information with the advertiser responsible for the offer. In the event either we or a participating advertiser are unable to capture your transaction detail, we may need to provide certain of your personal information to the advertiser to validate your transaction with them to ensure that your account is credited with the correct Incentive Money. However, before any personal information is provided to an advertiser for any such purpose, the advertiser will be contractually bound to observe the strict requirements of the Amulyam Privacy Policy.<br><br>

To further ensure we have your consent, we make sure each e-mail we send you contains an additional opportunity to "opt out" of receiving future e-mails. If you are not interested in receiving either e-mail or direct mail marketing, you may choose to opt out from receiving the e-mail or close your membership.<br><br>

While the data protection laws of these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect your information based upon the express terms of this Privacy Policy.

Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows them to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Amulyam does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your computer, and has no control over these parties' privacy policies or information collection practices.<br><br>

We occasionally pass personally identifiable information via a secure interface to certain of our advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their offers. However, this information is only to be used by the advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer.<br><br>

We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br><br>

The validation information shared is used solely for this purpose and may include your first name, last name, email address, mailing address or date of birth. We will require that these third parties comply with the information practices set forth in this Privacy Promise and that the information not be shared or used for any other purpose.<br><br>

We use this information to enhance our program offerings, namely to tailor advertisements, updates, and offers to your particular interests and to ensure that your opt-out requests are honored. All such third-party data processors are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Amulyam.

Data supplementation involves appending any publicly available information about you to your personal profile.<br><br>

Next, we might seek out any information about you that is publicly available on the open market and overlay this data onto ours for comparison purposes. Information collected in this manner could include your spending habits from a mail-order catalogue, demographic information you provided in entering a sweepstakes, or your financial history. All of this results in a program that is tailored to your personal interests and provides you with the most relevant Point-earning opportunities.<br><br>
