            <p>The services offered by AMF Bowling Centers, Inc., its parent
companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "AMF," "we,"
"us" or "our") include the AMF.com website (the "Site"), and any
other features, content, or applications offered from time to time
by AMF in connection with the Site (collectively, the "AMF
Services"). The Site and the AMF Services are owned by AMF.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy states the terms under which Content and
personally-identifiable and non-identifying information about you
is collected and used when accessing the Site, whether you are a
"Visitor" (meaning you simply browse the Site) or you are a
"Subscriber" (meaning you have voluntarily submitted your Personal
Information to the Site in order to receive the AMF Services
offered through the Site). Please read this page carefully.
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have
the meanings given them in the Terms of Use Agreement. "Personal
Information" means all personally-identifiable information (such as
your name, address, home and mobile telephone numbers, birth date
or e-mail address) to be used in connection with the AMF Services
that is submitted by Visitors or Subscribers who access the Site.
By accessing the Site, you agree to the terms set forth in this
Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be modified at any time.
AMF will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material
changes to this Privacy Policy; however, you should visit this page
periodically to review it each time you use the Site. By continuing
to access or use the Site as a Subscriber or Visitor, you agree to
be bound by this Privacy Policy. Please consult our <strong><a href="/terms.aspx" title="Terms">Terms of Use

<p><strong>I.&nbsp;<span>Information and Content Collected By
AMF</span></strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.&nbsp;<em><strong>Personal
Information</strong></em><br>
 Your privacy is important to us. AMF does not collect Personal
Information unless you voluntarily submit that information to AMF
when you use the AMF Services, send inquiries to AMF, or

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
b.&nbsp;<em><strong>Content</strong></em><br>
 AMF assumes no responsibility for securing any Content you submit

to use, for any purpose, any Content you submit to the Site.<br>
<br>
 c.&nbsp;<em><strong>Information Gathered
Automatically</strong></em><br>
 When you visit our Site, AMF may automatically collect certain
non-identifying information about you, such as your movement about
the Site, the pages on the Site you visit most frequently, the type

your computer's hard drive as "cookies" or similar types of files
to track and target your interests and preferences to ensure you
are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements as well as to
customize advertising and Site Material based on browser type and
Personal Information you may submit to the Site. AMF uses this
information internally to help it enhance the efficiency and
usefulness of the Site and to improve customer service. If you
object to this practice, please consult your browser's

<p><strong>IV.&nbsp;<span>Use/Disclosure of Personal Information
Collected By AMF</span></strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.&nbsp;<em><strong>How AMF Uses
Your Personal Information</strong></em><br>
 The Personal Information we collect from you may be used in one of
the following ways:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">i.&nbsp;To personalize your
experience. Your Personal Information helps us to better respond to
your individual needs.<br>
 ii.&nbsp;To improve the Site. We continually strive to improve
offerings on the Site based on the information and feedback we
receive from you.<br>

helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service
requests and support needs.<br>
 iv.&nbsp;To administer bowling tournaments, contests, promotions,
surveys or other Site features.<br>
 v.&nbsp;To send periodic mailings. The addresses and mobile
numbers you provide to us through the AMF Services may be used to
send you information and updates pertaining to AMF, in addition to
receiving occasional company news, updates, or related product or
service information. You are responsible for all telecommunications
charges relating to your use of the AMF Services, including but not
limited to any charges for text messages that are sent to you by
AMF.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b.&nbsp;<em><strong>Disclosure of
Your Personal Information</strong></em><br>
 AMF treats any Personal Information you submit to the Site as
confidential. Information AMF gathers, whether voluntarily provided
by you or automatically collected, may be used for our internal
business and marketing purposes. Additionally, AMF may transfer,
disclose or share certain Personal Information with third party
vendors for the sole purpose of compiling AMF's customer databases.
These third parties have access to Personal Information needed to
perform their functions, but are prohibited from using it for any
other purpose. Except for the foregoing, AMF will not sell, trade
or otherwise intentionally transfer your Personal Information to
third parties without your permission. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other statements or representations here or
elsewhere on the Site, AMF reserves the right to disclose any
Personal Information in our possession if AMF believes that such
disclosure is compelled: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to
respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process
received by AMF, whether or not a response is required by
applicable law; (2) to enforce the AMF Terms of Use Agreement or to
protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the
public and AMF Visitors and Subscribers. AMF reserves the right to
transfer Personal Information to a successor in interest that
acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of AMF
or substantially all of its assets to that successor in
interest.</p>

<p><strong>V.&nbsp;<span>Additional Privacy Protections for
Children</span></strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While certain AMF Services
advertised on the Site may be designed for children, the Site
itself is not designed for or targeted to children under the age of
13 and AMF will never knowingly collect the information of a child
under the age or 13 through the Site unless such information is
submitted by that child's parent or guardian in connection with
such AMF Services. Any information submitted to AMF about a child
under the age of 13 by anyone other than that child's parent or
guardian will be deleted. Any information AMF reasonably believes
originated from a child under the age of 13 will be deleted.
Children should never reveal their addresses, phone numbers, or
other personally-identifiable information on the Internet.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Parents who submit their child's
information to the Site in connection with the AMF Services may
review any identifiable information collected about their child,
have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no
further collection or use of their child's information. If you have
submitted information about your child and would like to review
this information, AMF requests that you mail or fax your request
to:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">AMF Bowling Centers, Inc.<br>
 7313 Bell Creek Road<br>
 Mechanicsville, VA 23111<br>
 Fax: 804 417 2157</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your request must contain your
child's name, your name, your relationship to the child, your
signature, and the date of your request.</p>

<p><strong>VI.&nbsp;<span>Security</span></strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a.&nbsp;AMF has reasonable security
measures in place to protect Personal Information you submit to the
Site. All Personal Information submitted to the Site or in
connection with the AMF Services is accessible only by those AMF
employees (such as our marketing and customer service personnel and
technical staff) and third party vendors authorized with special
access rights to such systems and who are required to keep such
information confidential.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the
foregoing, AMF cannot guarantee the security of your Personal
Information. When you communicate with AMF by phone, text, or email
or submit your Personal Information, your communication is not
necessarily secure and is subject to all of the risks of electronic
communication, such as unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
software failure, and other factors that may compromise the
security of Personal Information at any time. AMF assumes no
responsibility for the security of any Personal Information you
submit to the Site. AMF reserves the right to update or otherwise
alter our security practices if and when it seems appropriate.</p>
