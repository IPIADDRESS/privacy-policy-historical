<p>We may receive information through the use of cookies, web

purposes. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in
collecting information about Web site usage, e-mail response and

<p>A designated service provider, or third-party advertisers or
their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique
cookies on your device or use similar electronic tools in order to
display advertisements that you see on our Web site. Information
about your visits to, and activity on, our Web site, an IP address,
as well as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement,
are used to display on your device screen customized advertisements
that may be of particular interest to you. We do not have access

<p>Company's designated service provider may assist Company with
advertisement display functions for our Web sites. For more
information about such provider's handling of non-Personal
Information and use practices, including the use of cookies, as
well as its instructions on how to "opt out" of having your Web

multiple browsers (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox,
etc.), you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly,
if you connect to the Web from multiple devices (e.g., work and
home), you need to explicitly opt out from each browser on each
device.</p>

<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to
alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most
browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify
you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely.
However, it is possible that some parts of this Web site, such as
the polls, surveys, contests, product sales, and game areas, will
not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

<p>Our Web sites may also use web analytics services provided by
service providers (e.g., Google). Such providers may use cookies to
help the Website analyze how users use the Web site. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of our Web site
(including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by
such providers. Such providers may use this information for the
purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports
on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other
services relating to Web site activity and internet usage. Such
providers may also transfer this information to third parties where
required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on such provider's behalf. You may refuse the use of
cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser as
described above, however please note that if you do this you may
not be able to use the full functionality of our Web site.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party
Advertisers</span></p>

<p>As mentioned above, sponsors or advertisers on Company's Web
sites may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online
tracking technologies in the advertisements served on our Web
Sites, Apps and in emails, special promotions, newsletters or
communication we send you. Some advertisers use companies other
than Company to serve their advertisement and to monitor users'
responses to advertisement, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may
also receive non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or
web beacons. In certain situations, information collection may be
facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site
of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the
sponsor or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its
selected destination. This re-direction process may not be apparent
to you.</p>

<p>We do not control third party's use of cookies or web beacons,
or how they manage the non-Personal Information they receive. You
should not provide Personal Information to such sponsors,
advertisers and Ad Servers without your consent. Certain Ad Servers
allow you to prevent such third party's from collecting data
through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt out of
such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can
opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network
Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site.</p>

<p>Some of the information gathered from the use of cookies, web
beacons and similar technology is described below.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information from Video
and Interactions with Web site and Properties</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information about your interactions
with video content (if any) on this Web site, such as the type of
content viewed and information about your interactions with email
messages (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were
opened or forwarded).&nbsp; We may also receive non-Personal
Information through your interactions with the Web site and our
other properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information on Web
pages and Links</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information on Web pages and
advertisements you view from the Web site and links within the Web
site.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">URL, Browser Type,
Operating Systems and IP Address</span></p>

<p>Like many other Web sites, we may receive non-Personal
Information about our users' utilization, activity and navigation
of our Web site, Web sites of selected sponsors and advertisers,
your browser type, IP protocol and operating system.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apps</span></p>

<p>When you download and install our Apps onto your device, we may
assign a number to your App installation. This number cannot be
used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you
personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the
App. We use this number in a manner similar to our use of cookies
as described above. Unlike cookies, the number is assigned to your
installation of the App itself and not a browser because the App
does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number
cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use
the random number for the purposes for which we use cookies, please
do not use the App.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party
Sources</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information from other sources, such
as through vendors and service providers with authorized rights to
such information, and from publicly available sources.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Non-Personal
Information</span></p>

<p>The paragraphs described above outline some of our uses of
non-Personal Information. &nbsp;We may also use non-Personal
Information to help us monitor how many people are using our Web
site and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, to provide
enhanced functionality on the Web site (e.g., user ID and password
prompts, navigation aids, and session timers), to help us generate
and deliver advertising, marketing and content on Web pages or any
of our other properties, to monitor certain other Web site activity
(e.g., user-agent, last URL requested by the user, client-side and
server-side clickstream, age restrictions), to monitor how many
people open our emails, and for functions related to the
foregoing.</p>

<p>We may also use and share non-Personal Information in the same
manner as our use of Personal Information described below and in
connection with our business (e.g., our third party contractors,
agents and representatives may help us utilize cookies and web
beacons, and store/handle non-Personal Information).</p>

<h2 class="p-title-0 mb-5">3. Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may use third party administrators, agents or representatives
to assist us in managing such User Forums. You may be given the

a survey if it is paid. We are responsible for the surveys which we
may introduce to you through our properties. We are not responsible
for unauthorized surveys that are conducted on third party sites.

to Company.</p>

disclose any Personal Information we receive without your consent
