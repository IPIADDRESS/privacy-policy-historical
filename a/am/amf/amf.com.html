            <p>Bowlmor AMF Corp, AMF Bowling Centers Inc. d/b/a Bowlmor AMF
Centers, its affiliates and its properties ("Company" or "we,"
"our," or "us") respects the privacy of our users. This Privacy
Policy will tell you how and what information we may receive about
you, and how we may use your information when providing you our
tools, products and services. Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully. Please consult our <strong><a href="/terms.aspx" title="Terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></strong> for additional
terms and conditions that apply to your use of and access to the
Site.</p>

<p>1. How this Privacy Policy Applies</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Web sites owned and operated by
the Company and the mobile optimized versions of these sites. This
Privacy Policy also applies to any other property and application
owned or operated by Company ("App") which links to or references
this Privacy Policy. Except where expressly noted, statements in
this Privacy Policy with respect to our Web sites also apply to our
Apps and such other properties.</p>

<p>Our Web sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware
when you visit another Web site (whether through an advertisement,
service, link or otherwise). Company is not responsible for the
privacy practices of these other sites, nor do we endorse, warrant,
recommend or guarantee the services offered through such other
sites. You should review the privacy statements of those other Web
sites.</p>

<p>In connection with the tools, products and services provided
through our Web sites, some of the information you provide may
constitute Personal Information. &nbsp;"Personal Information" means
non-public information that can identify you individually on a
personal basis.&nbsp; Also, some information we receive through
such tools, products and services may be non-Personal Information.
You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of information you
provide to the Company. Inaccurate information may affect the
information you receive when using such tools, products and
services.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Personal Information</p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information about you as
follows:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies and Web
Beacons</span></p>

<p>We may receive information through the use of cookies, web
beacons, and similar technology. Cookies are pieces of data that a
Web site transfers to a user's hard drive for record-keeping
purposes. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in
collecting information about Web site usage, e-mail response and
tracking.</p>

<p>A designated service provider, or third-party advertisers or
their advertising servers may also place or recognize unique
cookies on your device or use similar electronic tools in order to
display advertisements that you see on our Web site. Information
about your visits to, and activity on, our Web site, an IP address,
as well as the number of times you have viewed an advertisement,
are used to display on your device screen customized advertisements
that may be of particular interest to you. We do not have access
to, or control the information collected by, these cookies or
similar electronic tools used by these third-party advertisers or
their advertising servers. The use and collection of your
information by these third-party advertisers and advertising
servers is not covered by this Privacy Policy. For information
about advertising networks and how to "opt out" of cookies placed
by the Network Advertising Initiative's member advertising
networks, please contact the third party companies.</p>

<p>Company's designated service provider may assist Company with
advertisement display functions for our Web sites. For more
information about such provider's handling of non-Personal
Information and use practices, including the use of cookies, as
well as its instructions on how to "opt out" of having your Web
site usage information collected or used by such provider, please
contact us. When you opt out via this method, you officially opt
out of such provider's advertisement display programs for your
device's particular Web browser. You need to opt out for each
browser, on each device you use to surf the Web. Thus, if you use
multiple browsers (e.g., AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox,
etc.), you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly,
if you connect to the Web from multiple devices (e.g., work and
home), you need to explicitly opt out from each browser on each
device.</p>

<p>Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
prefer, you can usually set your browser to disable cookies, or to
alert you when cookies are being sent. The help function on most
browsers contains instructions on how to set your browser to notify
you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely.
However, it is possible that some parts of this Web site, such as
the polls, surveys, contests, product sales, and game areas, will
not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

<p>Our Web sites may also use web analytics services provided by
service providers (e.g., Google). Such providers may use cookies to
help the Website analyze how users use the Web site. The
information generated by the cookie about your use of our Web site
(including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by
such providers. Such providers may use this information for the
purpose of evaluating your use of the Web site, compiling reports
on Web site activity for Web site operators and providing other
services relating to Web site activity and internet usage. Such
providers may also transfer this information to third parties where
required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on such provider's behalf. You may refuse the use of
cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser as
described above, however please note that if you do this you may
not be able to use the full functionality of our Web site.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party
Advertisers</span></p>

<p>As mentioned above, sponsors or advertisers on Company's Web
sites may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online
tracking technologies in the advertisements served on our Web
Sites, Apps and in emails, special promotions, newsletters or
communication we send you. Some advertisers use companies other
than Company to serve their advertisement and to monitor users'
responses to advertisement, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may
also receive non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or
web beacons. In certain situations, information collection may be
facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the Web site
of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the
sponsor or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its
selected destination. This re-direction process may not be apparent
to you.</p>

<p>We do not control third party's use of cookies or web beacons,
or how they manage the non-Personal Information they receive. You
should not provide Personal Information to such sponsors,
advertisers and Ad Servers without your consent. Certain Ad Servers
allow you to prevent such third party's from collecting data
through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt out of
such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can
opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network
Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site.</p>

<p>Some of the information gathered from the use of cookies, web
beacons and similar technology is described below.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information from Video
and Interactions with Web site and Properties</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information about your interactions
with video content (if any) on this Web site, such as the type of
content viewed and information about your interactions with email
messages (e.g., links clicked on and whether the messages were
opened or forwarded).&nbsp; We may also receive non-Personal
Information through your interactions with the Web site and our
other properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information on Web
pages and Links</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information on Web pages and
advertisements you view from the Web site and links within the Web
site.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">URL, Browser Type,
Operating Systems and IP Address</span></p>

<p>Like many other Web sites, we may receive non-Personal
Information about our users' utilization, activity and navigation
of our Web site, Web sites of selected sponsors and advertisers,
your browser type, IP protocol and operating system.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apps</span></p>

<p>When you download and install our Apps onto your device, we may
assign a number to your App installation. This number cannot be
used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you
personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the
App. We use this number in a manner similar to our use of cookies
as described above. Unlike cookies, the number is assigned to your
installation of the App itself and not a browser because the App
does not work through your browser. Therefore the random number
cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use
the random number for the purposes for which we use cookies, please
do not use the App.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party
Sources</span></p>

<p>We may receive non-Personal Information from other sources, such
as through vendors and service providers with authorized rights to
such information, and from publicly available sources.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Non-Personal
Information</span></p>

<p>The paragraphs described above outline some of our uses of
non-Personal Information. &nbsp;We may also use non-Personal
Information to help us monitor how many people are using our Web
site and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, to provide
enhanced functionality on the Web site (e.g., user ID and password
prompts, navigation aids, and session timers), to help us generate
and deliver advertising, marketing and content on Web pages or any
of our other properties, to monitor certain other Web site activity
(e.g., user-agent, last URL requested by the user, client-side and
server-side clickstream, age restrictions), to monitor how many
people open our emails, and for functions related to the
foregoing.</p>

<p>We may also use and share non-Personal Information in the same
manner as our use of Personal Information described below and in
connection with our business (e.g., our third party contractors,
agents and representatives may help us utilize cookies and web
beacons, and store/handle non-Personal Information).</p>

<p>3. Personal Information</p>

<p>We may receive Personal Information which you provide to us
including, as follows:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Registration
Information</span></p>

<p>You may share Personal Information with us through registration,
subscription or other sign up on newsletters, trade shows, offers,
features, conferences, products, tools or other services provided
by us (and as part of the foregoing). The information you share
with us may be changed by you by notifying us or by following the
instructions provided to you by Company at registration.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Areas,
Chats, Postings, Bulletin Boards, Blogs and other User
Forums</span></p>

<p>We may provide an opportunity for users to communicate in
community areas, postings, wikis, bulletin boards, chat rooms,
blogs and other public and interactive forums on or through our Web
Sites ("User Forums"). Our User Forums are open to the public and
should not be considered private.</p>

<p>Any information you share in any User Forum (including Personal
Information) is by design open to the public and is not private. We
are not responsible for any information that you share in any User
Forum. &nbsp;You should be aware of the risks to you which can
arise from sharing Personal Information in any User Forum. &nbsp;If
you mistakenly post information on any User Forum and would like it
removed, please contact us to request its removal. We will try our
best to accommodate such removal request - however, not all
information may be removable.</p>

<p>Please be aware that what you share in User Forums can be seen,
disclosed to, collected and used by parties in ways we cannot
control or predict, including to contact you for any purpose. As
with any public forum on any site, the information you share may
also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN,
Bing, etc.</p>

<p>We may use third party administrators, agents or representatives
to assist us in managing such User Forums. You may be given the
option to register or create an account for such administrator. You
are responsible for the information you share with such
administrator as part of such registration or account creation
process. Your information may be subject to additional privacy
policies disclosed to you by such administrator.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interactive
Tools</span></p>

<p>We may offer you interactive content, tools, products and
services. In connection with such items, we may receive
information, including Personal Information, which you voluntarily
share with us. Some of the tools (like certain quizzes) do not
retain your Personal Information, while others (like tools offered
through Apps) may store your Personal Information.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Market
Research</span></p>

<p>We may offer you an opportunity to respond to market research
studies, questionnaires or surveys. In connection with such items,
we may receive information, including Personal Information, which
you voluntarily share with us. For general market research surveys,
studies or questionnaires we will not knowingly accept responses
from or conduct interviews with any person under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Some market research surveys, studies and questionnaires may
provide remuneration (payment of some kind) to participants such as
a gift card for your time. We will notify you upon participation in
a survey if it is paid. We are responsible for the surveys which we
may introduce to you through our properties. We are not responsible
for unauthorized surveys that are conducted on third party sites.
You may be directed by link, banner ad or otherwise from our Web
Site to visit an advertiser's Web site that may introduce you to
surveys or questionnaires. We are not affiliated with, nor do we
endorse, warrant, recommend or guarantee any part of, any services
or offerings on such Web Sites directed from our Web Site.&nbsp;
These surveys are not subject to our policies and are not related
to Company.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Personal
Information</span></p>

<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not use or
disclose any Personal Information we receive without your consent

<p>We may disclose and use Personal Information to comply with
valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant,
subpoena or court order; or in special cases, such as in response
to, to prevent or stop a physical threat, harm, threats to safety,
liability, risks, criminality or tortious conduct onto you, us, our
users, their property, or defend or assert legal rights. In
addition, we may use Personal Information to provide you the tools,
products and services requested or agreed by you (e.g.,
newsletters, reports, apps, games, mailings, alerts, notifications

you through any contact information you provide with us, including
any cellular/mobile telephone number/device, and you are solely
responsible for any charges, including SMS/text charges, incurred
related thereto.</p>

<p>We may also use Personal Information to develop and provide you

offerings or products that may be of interest to you. You may

foregoing uses to our affiliates, successors, assigns and their
representatives, and to personnel, agents, service providers and
contractors who perform functions on our behalf or otherwise in
connection with the foregoing uses.&nbsp; Personal Information may
also be provided to certain strategic partners, alliance partners,

established a relationship, we will share information with such
association so that they can assess business impact resulting from
our relationship).</p>
