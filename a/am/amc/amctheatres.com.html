We value the relationship we have with our guests, members and clients, and we are committed to responsible information handling practices. <br><br>This privacy policy only applies to information collected from you by AMC Entertainment, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “AMC”, “we” “us” “our” and “ourselves”) on websites where this privacy policy is posted. This privacy policy does not apply to any information collected by us through any other means. <br><br>Although AMC makes available a number of websites with unique services and offerings, each AMC website shares similar privacy philosophies and principles, including the following. <br><br>* Providing you with notice of our information practices <br>* Giving you choices about how we will use your data <br>* Providing you the opportunity to update or correct your personally identifiable information <br>* Using information security safeguards <br>* Limiting the sharing of your information with other parties <br>* Committing to complying with applicable privacy requirements <br>* Providing you with means to contact us about privacy-related issues <br><br>The following privacy policy describes how we collect, use and protect information collected from you at www.amcentertainment.com. To assist you with reading our privacy policy, we have provided answers to questions you may find most important. <br><br><font color="#008080">1. WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME DOES AMC COLLECT?</font><br><br>You may provide us with two types of information during your visit to AMC’s website. <br><br>* Anonymous information we collect <br>* Personal information that you voluntarily share with us <br><br>Anonymous or Non-Personally Identifiable Information. <br><br>AMC automatically collects information from you when you visit AMC’s website, such as the search engine you used to access the AMC website, the previous websites you visited, the websites or advertisements you view or select, the type of Internet browser you use, the computer operating system you use, and your computer's IP address. AMC may also collect information concerning your movie preferences, such as the movies for which you purchase tickets and the theatres in which you view those movies. AMC also collects information that you may disclose on the AMC website such as ratings or review pages, blogs, and message boards. <br><br>We may also retain third parties to place and manage advertisements on our websites. These third party advertisers may use cookies and other technology to collect information about your visits to our websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. This information is not personally associated with you, and AMC may share it with third parties from time to time. <br><br>Personally Identifiable Information. <br><br>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, payment method and other information once it is associated with your personally identifiable information. We may ask you to provide personally identifiable information when you create an online account, purchase products or services, join a frequent moviegoer or other loyalty program, participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey, contact us with a question or concern, or participate in other activities when you visit an AMC website. We may also collect publicly available information about you from other sources, such as information from newspapers, blogs, and commercial websites or third party data aggregators and supplement your personally identifiable information maintained by us. AMC also collects personally identifiable information that you may disclose on the AMC website such as ratings or review pages, blogs, and message boards.. <br><br><font color="#008080">2. HOW DOES AMC USE INFORMATION? <br></font><br>AMC uses personally identifiable information for the purpose for which you provided it, such as to fulfill your request for products, services or information, to process and administer your contest or sweepstakes entry, to activate your online account, and to allow you to participate in a public area of its website. AMC also uses personally identifiable information to notify you of changes to AMC’s websites, to provide you with entertainment news, e-mail offers, and movie ticket savings, to let you know about other products and services that may be of interest to you, and to tailor our online or in-store offerings to your preferences. <br><br>AMC also combines anonymous usage information collected from your visit to an AMC website with that of other users to determine which features and areas of the website are most popular. By collecting and analyzing this data, AMC can improve the websites. This aggregated information does not contain information personally associated with you. <br><br>AMC may also update and supplement personally identifiable information collected from you with other information that we obtain from third parties or from our subsidiaries and affiliates. If we associate information obtained from our affiliates and subsidiaries or third parties with personally identifiable information collected under this policy we will treat the acquired information like information we have collected ourselves. <br><br><font color="#008080">3. DOES AMC SHARE OR TRANSFER THE INFORMATION I PROVIDE? <br></font><br>Sharing among the AMC Family of Companies. <br><br>We may combine personally identifiable information collected by an AMC affiliate or subsidiary with personally identifiable information we have collected, and we may share your personally identifiable information with other AMC subsidiaries or affiliates. <br><br>Sharing with Third Parties. <br><br>AMC shares aggregated information with its third party service providers to assist AMC with collecting demographic information and improving its websites. AMC shares aggregated information with potential advertisers, contractors, investors and other third parties in connection with the sale of advertising and the marketing of AMC’s products and services. <br><br>In the future, if AMC chooses to rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties, AMC will first gain your consent. If you expressly opt-in to receiving marketing communications from AMC on behalf of third parties concerning products or services,&nbsp;AMC will share the necessary portion of your personally identifiable information with those third parties for that limited purpose. <br><br>AMC uses third parties to assist it in providing services, fulfilling orders and information requests, to improve your experience on AMC’s websites and for other business purposes. AMC will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties for these purposes; however, these third parties will not contact you directly. <br><br>Moreover, if you are a member of a social network service, such as Facebook, MySpace, or similar website where you have authorized them to gather information about your online behavior on AMC’s website (for instance, to notify your friends that you have reviewed a movie or bought tickets), including participation in any behavioral reporting program that they may operate on or off of their own site (i.e., Facebook Beacon, etc.), AMC may share information regarding your activities on an AMC website with those third parties under and as authorized by you, and they may associate that information with personally identifiable information they already have about you (such as your Facebook Profile) and use it to improve their site or services or for other purposes. <br><br>When AMC uses agents, contractors or other companies to perform services on its behalf, AMC will require that they protect your personally identifiable information in accordance with this privacy policy. In contrast, you must be comfortable with the privacy policies of any social network site that you authorize to gather information from AMC, as the privacy policies of these social network sites will govern the use of your personally identifiable information once it has been transmitted by AMC. <br><br>Disclosure Required by Law. <br><br>From time to time, AMC may be required to provide your personally identifiable information in response to a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We also may share certain personally identifiable information when we believe that such sharing is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. <br><br>Disclosure as a part of a Business Transaction. <br><br>AMC may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in relation to planned or potential corporate sales, mergers, reorganizations, dissolutions or similar events. As a part of any such transaction, AMC will treat your information as an asset and transfer it to the purchaser. <br><br>Transfer of Information. <br><br>If you reside outside of the United States, such as in the European Union or elsewhere, please be aware that any information you provide to us at www.amcentertainment.com will be transferred to and processed in the United States. If you do not wish for us to transfer your personally identifiable information into the United States, do not submit it to us. If you provide us with your personally identifiable information, we will treat your submission of that information as your consent to allow us to transfer it to the United States. Any personally identifiable information that we collect from you at www.amcentertainment.com will be treated in accordance with this privacy policy. <br><br><font color="#008080">4. HOW DOES AMC KEEP MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</font><br><br>We use several encryption methods, such as Secure Sockets Layer for the transmission of data, and other measures to ensure that the personally identifiable information you submit to AMC through your use of an AMC website is secure. We take reasonable measures to ensure that your information remains reliable, accurate, complete and current. We also take physical, electronic and managerial steps to maintain the security and accuracy of information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as using electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access by other visitors or third parties. <br><br><font color="#008080">5. DOES AMC USE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES?</font><br><br>Cookies. <br><br>Cookies are information files that our websites may send to your computer to provide extended functionality and to allow us to collect anonymous data to track usage patterns, monitor activity and administer our websites. Cookies let us "remember" information about your preferences and allow you to move about our websites without reintroducing yourself. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns on the website, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, or limiting multiple responses and registrations when we conduct polls and sweepstakes. Once you have entered your user ID and password, we use cookies to access, retrieve or store your personally identifiable information, such as your password, so you do not have to enter it more than once. You may disable cookies, receive a warning before a cookie is placed on your computer, and erase cookies from your hard drive through use of options or preferences menus in your browser. It is possible, however, that some parts of our website will not operate correctly if you disable the cookie feature. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies. <br><br>Log Data. <br><br>When you visit AMC's websites, our web servers automatically collect anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our website. This information includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, as well as the anonymous information that your web browser automatically sends to us, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited before and after your visit to our website, and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology is available through your browser to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, we may determine that you have installed a version of Flash, and we will then send to you the appropriate Flash version of the web page rather than an HTML page. <br><br>IP Addresses. <br><br>An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. When visitors request pages from our website, our servers log the visitor's IP address. We or our service providers may also serve advertisements based upon the geographic location of your IP address. <br><br>Clear GIFs. <br><br>Clear GIFs or pixels are invisible files on web pages that you visit. When you visit a page on AMC’s website that contains a clear GIF, the clear GIF communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement. We or our third party advertising providers may use clear GIF to track usage of AMC websites. <br><br>Other Methods. <br><br>Where authorized by law and as permitted by FTC guidelines, AMC may use web beacons, other monitoring technologies and third party service providers who may gather data for purposes of advertising or reporting website traffic and statistics. <br><br><font color="#008080">6. CAN OTHER PARTIES OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM ME WHEN I VISIT AN AMC WEBSITE? <br></font><br>We may allow third parties to deliver advertisements on our websites. Our websites may also contain links to websites that are owned and operated by third parties. You should be aware that when you click on these third-party advertisements or links, you may deploy cookies or web beacons, which third parties may use to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously been to their website or otherwise had contact with them. Certain activities on our websites are sponsored by third parties, such as the purchase of DVDs from www.amazon.com, and you will be asked to submit personally identifiable information to complete your transaction. Both Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com are gathering customer information, including credit card details on their web sites. We do not control how these third parties use the information they collect from you, whether collected from the delivery of advertisements to you, your use of links or your purchase of products or other voluntary submissions of information. We have no responsibility (and disclaim any representations, warranties or responsibility) for these third-party advertisements and websites, including, without limitation, their content and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the advertisers and websites to learn how they may collect and use information about you. <br><br>If you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in a public area of an AMC website, such as a review page, blog or message board, third parties may collect this information and use it to send you unsolicited marketing communications, messages or for other purposes. You disclose personally identifiable information in public areas of the AMC websites at your own risk. <br><br><font color="#008080">7. HOW DO I CONTACT AMC TO REQUEST ACCESS OR CORRECTION TO MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</font><br><br>You may obtain a copy of your personally identifiable information by contacting AMC Entertainment, Attention: Privacy Manager, 920 Main Street, Kansas City, MO 64105 or at privacymanager@amctheatres.com. For your protection, you will be required to provide proof of your identity to obtain a copy of your personally identifiable information. You may correct any errors in your personally identifiable information by providing AMC with the correct information. AMC will delete your personally identifiable information (except for your transaction history) from our records upon your written request. However, you will not be able to access some areas of the AMC website if you choose to delete your personally identifiable information. <br><br>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits guests and customers of the AMC family of companies who are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may make such a request by contacting AMC Theatres, Attention: Privacy Manager, 920 Main Street, Kansas City, MO 64105 or at privacymanager@amctheatres.com. <br><br><font color="#008080">8. HOW DO I OPT OUT OF RECEIVING COMMUNICATIONS FROM AMC?</font><br><br>When you create an account with us and during certain purchase transactions, you may opt out of receiving communications from AMC and its service providers. If you have an account with us, you may update your preferences concerning communications at any time. You may also opt out of receiving communications from us by following the directions in our e-mail communications with you or by mailing your request, which must include your current contact information, to: <br><br>AMC Entertainment<br>Attn: Privacy Manager <br>920 Main Street <br>Kansas City, MO 64105 <br><br>We will implement your request within a reasonable time. Please note that your request to opt out of receiving our communications will only apply to future communications and transactions. Even if you choose to opt out of receiving communications from us, we will still send you transactional or administrative communications. <br><br><font color="#008080">9. DOES AMC COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN?</font><br><br>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Before a child under 13 is permitted to create an online account with us, register for an AMC activity, participate in a public area of an AMC website or otherwise submit personally identifiable information to us, the parent or guardian of that child must submit to us a completed parental consent form <a title="available here. " href="/uploadedFiles/MovieWatcher_Network/FINAL_4.8.09%20parental%20consent%20form.pdf">available here. </a>The form may be transmitted to us by first class mail or by e-mail to the address set out below. <br><br>Once we have express parental consent, the child will be permitted to create an online account with us. To create the online account we will generally collect the following information, but not limited to: first name, last name, physical address, e-mail address, telephone number, age, screen name and password. Depending upon the activity, we may also collect information on gender, hobbies and movie preferences. We collect age information to validate the age of persons creating online accounts with us, including children. We may collect personally identifiable information about a child from the child’s parent to communicate with the child, to permit participation in a public area of an AMC website or participate in an AMC activity. We do not require children under 13 to submit more personally identifiable information than is needed to participate in the AMC activity in which they are interested. Unless you tell us otherwise on a completed parental consent form, AMC will only use the personally identifiable information for the purpose for which the information was provided. <br><br>Unless you tell us otherwise on a completed parental consent form, we will not use children's personally identifiable information for any marketing or promotional purposes outside of the AMC family of companies. We will not share children’s personally identifiable information with third parties unless those third parties are bound by a written agreement to protect the confidentiality of the information and only as necessary to provide the services described elsewhere on the AMC website. In all cases, we protect children's personally identifiable information in accordance with this privacy policy, the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and other applicable data protection laws. <br><br>As a parent, you have the right to review our records of your child’s personally identifiable information. You also have the right to have us delete that information and prohibit us from collecting or using personally identifiable information from your child in the future. For the protection of you and your child, you will be required to provide proof of your identity to obtain a copy of your child’s personally identifiable information. To exercise your parental rights in this regard, please e-mail us at PrivacyManager@amctheatres.com, or contact us at: <br><br>AMC Theatres <br>Attn: Privacy Manager <br>920 Main Street <br>Kansas City, MO 64105 <br><br><font color="#008080">10. WILL THIS PRIVACY POLICY CHANGE?</font><br><br>AMC may change this privacy policy at any time. If we modify our privacy policy to permit material changes in the way we collect, use and share your personally identifiable information, we will notify you of the modification by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address you provided to use and by prominently posting notice of the modification here and on the home page for each AMC website governed by this privacy policy. Modifications will be effective 10 days following our transmission of e-mail notice and the posting of notice of the modification on the AMC websites covered by this privacy policy. <br><br>Any modification will affect the use and disclosure of information collected prior to the date of posting unless the modified privacy policy states otherwise. If you do not wish to allow such material changes, you must notify us in the manner we specify prior to the effective date of the modification. If you provide us this notice, we may choose to deactivate your account. Regardless of whether you provide us notice, any modification to this privacy policy will apply to personally identifiable information you provide us on or after the effective date of the modification. <br><br>Your use of an AMC website means that you accept the terms of this privacy policy and that AMC has the right to use information it collects from you, whether personally identifiable information or anonymous, as stated in this privacy policy. If you do not accept the terms of this privacy policy, you must not use the AMC websites. Use of an AMC website after a change to this privacy policy means that you accept the changes made to terms of this privacy policy. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us any time at PrivacyManager@amctheatres.com. <br><br>Last revision date: March 31, 2008. </p></div><input name="ctl00$ctl00$cphBodyContent$cphMainContent$mainContent$ctl00$ctl00$cphBodyContent$cphMainContent$mainContentEktronClientManager" type="hidden" id="ctl00_ctl00_cphBodyContent_cphMainContent_mainContent_ctl00_ctl00_cphBodyContent_cphMainContent_mainContentEktronClientManager" value="EktronJS,EktronWebToolBarJS,EktronAutoheightJS,EktronModalJS,EktronContentDesignerJS">
