<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Collection</span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">2.1 Sigma will only collect personal
information that is necessary for its functions or activities.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">2.2 Sigma will only collect personal
information by lawful and fair means and in a way which is not
unreasonably intrusive.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">2.3 When personal information is
collected from an individual (or, if that is not practicable, as
soon as practicable after) Sigma will take reasonable steps to
ensure that the individual is aware of:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">a) Sigma’s identity and how to
contact it;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">b) the fact that they are able to
gain access to the information;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">c) the purposes for which the
information is collected;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">d) the types of entities to which
Sigma usually discloses information of that kind;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">e) any law that requires the
particular information to be collected; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">f) the main consequences (if any)
for the individual if all or part of the information is not
provided.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">2.4 Where reasonable and practicable
to do so, Sigma will collect personal information about an
individual from that individual.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">2.5 If Sigma collects personal
information from someone other than the individual, it will take
reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is made aware of
the matters listed in subclause 2.3 except to the extent that
making the individual aware of the matters would pose a serious
threat to the life or health of any individual.</div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Use and disclosure</span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">3.1 Sigma will only use or disclose
personal information for a purpose (the secondary purpose) other
than the primary purpose of collection if:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">a) the secondary purpose is related
to the primary purpose of collection and, the individual would
reasonably expect the information to be used or disclosed for the
secondary purpose; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">b) the individual has consented to
the use or disclosure; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">c) the information is not sensitive
information and the use of the information is for the secondary
purpose of direct marketing where:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) it is impracticable for Sigma to
seek the individual’s consent before that particular use; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) the individual having been
offered the opportunity of declining to receive direct marketing
communication at no charge has not declined; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iii) the individual has not made a
request to the organisation not to receive direct marketing
communications; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iv) in each direct marketing
communication with the individual, Sigma draws to the individual’s
attention, or prominently displays a notice, that they may decline
to receive any further direct marketing communications; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(v) each written direct marketing
communication by Sigma with the individual sets out Sigma’s
contact details; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">d) the information is health
information and the use or disclosure is necessary for research,
or the compilation or analysis of statistics, relevant to public
health or public safety where:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) it is impracticable for Sigma to
seek the individual’s consent before the use or disclosure; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) the use or disclosure is
conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the
Commissioner under section 95A of the Commonwealth Privacy Act;
and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iii) in the case of disclosure
Sigma reasonably believes that the recipient of the health
information will not disclose the health information, or personal
information derived from the health information; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">e) Sigma reasonably believes that
the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) a serious and imminent threat to
an individual’s life, health or safety; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) a serious threat to public
health or public safety; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">f) Sigma has reason to suspect that
unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, and
uses or discloses the personal information as a necessary part of
its investigation of the matter or in reporting its concerns to
relevant persons or authorities; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">g) the use or disclosure is required
or authorised by or under law; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">h) Sigma reasonably believes that
the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of
the following by or on behalf of an enforcement body:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) the prevention, detection,
investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences,
breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a
prescribed law;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) the enforcement of laws
relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iii) the protection of the public
revenue;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iv) the prevention, detection,
investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or
prescribed conduct;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(v) the preparation for, or conduct
of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of
the orders of a court or tribunal.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;"> 3.2 If Sigma uses or discloses
personal information under paragraph 3.1(h), it must make a
written note of the use or disclosure.</div>
<br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;"> 3.3 Despite subclause 3.1, Sigma
may disclose health information about an individual to a person
who is responsible for the individual if:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(a) the individual:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) is physically or legally
incapable of giving consent to the disclosure; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) physically cannot communicate
consent to the disclosure; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(b) Sigma is satisfied that either:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) the disclosure is necessary to
provide appropriate care or treatment of the individual; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) the disclosure is made for
compassionate reasons; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(c) the disclosure is not contrary
to any wish:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) expressed by the individual
before the individual became unable to give or communicate
consent; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) of which the carer is aware, or
of which the carer could reasonably be expected to be aware; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(d) the disclosure is limited to the
extent reasonable and necessary for a purpose mentioned in
paragraph (b).</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Data quality</span><br>
Sigma will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal
information it collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and
up-to-date.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Data security </span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">5.1 Sigma will take reasonable steps
to protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss
and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">5.2 Sigma will take reasonable steps
to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it
is no longer needed.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Openness</span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">6.1 This Privacy Policy sets out
Sigma’s corporate policy on management of personal information and
is available to anyone who asks for it.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">6.2 On request, Sigma will take
reasonable steps to let a person know, generally, what sort of
personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it
collects, holds, uses and discloses that information about that
person.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Access and correction</span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.1 Sigma will provide an individual
with access to the information on request by the individual,
except to the extent that: </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(a) in the case of personal
information other than health information providing access would
pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any
individual; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(b) in the case of health
information providing access would pose a serious threat to the
life or health of any individual; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(c) providing access would have an
unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(d) the request for access is
frivolous or vexatious; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(e) the information relates to
existing or anticipated legal proceedings between Sigma and the
individual, and the information would not be accessible by the
process of discovery in those proceedings; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(f) providing access would reveal
the intentions of Sigma in relation to negotiations with the
individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(g) providing access would be
unlawful;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(h) denying access is required or
authorised by or under law; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(i) providing access would be likely
to prejudice an investigation of possible unlawful activity; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(j) providing access would be likely
to prejudice:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) the prevention, detection,
investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences,
breaches of a law imposing a penalty sanction or breaches of a
prescribed law; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) the enforcement of laws
relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iii) the protection of the public
revenue; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iv) the prevention, detection,
investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or
prescribed conduct; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(v) the preparation for, or conduct
of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of
its orders;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">by or on behalf of an enforcement
body; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(k) an enforcement body performing a
lawful security function asks Sigma not to provide access to the
information.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.2 However, where providing access
would reveal evaluative information generated within Sigma in
connection with a commercially sensitive decision making process
Sigma may give the individual an explanation for the commercially
sensitive decision rather than direct access to the information.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.3 If Sigma is not required to
provide the individual with access to the information because of
one or more of paragraphs 7.1(a) to (k) (inclusive), Sigma will,
if reasonable, consider whether the use of mutually agreed
intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of
both parties.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.4 Sigma may charge a fee
reasonable for providing access to personal information, (but not
for lodging a request for access):</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.5 If Sigma holds personal
information about an individual and the</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">individual is able to establish that
the information is not accurate, complete and up to date, Sigma
will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it
is accurate, complete and up to date.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.6 If the individual and Sigma
disagree about whether the information is accurate, complete and
up to date, and the individual asks Sigma to include with the
information a statement claiming that the information is not
accurate, complete or up to date, Sigma will take reasonable steps
to do so. </div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">7.7 Sigma will provide reasons for
denial of access or a refusal to correct personal information.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Identifiers</span><br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">8.1 Sigma will not adopt an
identifier of an individual that has been assigned by:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(a) an agency; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(b) an agent of an agency acting in
its capacity as agent;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(c) a contracted service provider
for a Commonwealth contract acting in its capacity as contracted
service provider for that contract, unless</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(d) the use or disclosure is
necessary for Sigma to fulfil its obligations to the agency; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(e) one or more of paragraphs 3.1(e)
to 3.1(h) (inclusive) apply to the use or disclosure; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(f) the use or disclosure is by a
prescribed organisation of a prescribed identifier in prescribed
circumstances.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">8.2 However, subclause 8.1 does not
apply to the adoption by a prescribed organisation of a prescribed
identifier in prescribed circumstances.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">8.3 In this clause:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;"> identifier includes a number
assigned by Sigma to an individual to identify uniquely the
individual for the purposes of the organisation’s operations.
However, an individual’s name or ABN (as defined in the A New Tax
System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999) is not an
identifier.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9. Anonymity</span><br>
Wherever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the
option of not identifying themselves when entering into transactions
with Sigma.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10. Transborder data flows</span><br>
Sigma will only transfer personal information about an individual to
someone (other than the organisation or the individual) who is in a
foreign country if:<br>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(a) Sigma reasonably believes that
the recipient of the information is subject to a law, binding
scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for fair
handling of the information that are substantially similar to the
National Privacy Principles; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(b) the individual consents to the
transfer; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(c) the transfer is necessary for
the performance of a contract between the individual and Sigma, or
for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in
response to the individual’s request; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(d) the transfer is necessary for
the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the
interest of the individual between Sigma and a third party; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(e) all of the following apply:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(i) the transfer is for the benefit
of the individual;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(ii) it is impracticable to obtain
the consent of the individual to that transfer;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(iii) if it were practicable to
obtain such consent, the individual would be likely to give it; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">(f) Sigma has taken reasonable steps
to ensure that the information which it has transferred will not
be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information
inconsistently with the National Privacy Principles.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11. Sensitive information</span><br>

law; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(c) the collection is necessary to

incapable of giving consent to the collection; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) physically cannot communicate
consent to the collection; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(d) the collection is necessary for
the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal or equitable
claim.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">11.2 Despite subclause 11.1, Sigma
may collect health information about an individual if:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(a) the information is necessary to
provide a health service to the individual; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(b) the information is collected:</div>

the collection of information that does not identify the
individual or from which the individual’s identity cannot
reasonably be ascertained; </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(c) it is impracticable for Sigma to
seek the individual’s consent to the </div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">collection; and</div>
<div style="text-indent: 20px;">(d) the information is collected:</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(i) as required by law (other than
this Act); </div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(ii) in accordance with rules
established by competent health or medical bodies that deal with
obligations of professional confidentiality which bind the
organisation; or</div>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;">(iii) in accordance with guidelines
approved by the Commissioner under section 95A for the purposes of
this subparagraph.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 10px;">11.4 If Sigma collects health
information about an individual in accordance with subclause 11.3,
