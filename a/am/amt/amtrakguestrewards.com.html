<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p class="subheadblue">Section 2: The Personal Information We Collect from You on Amtrak.com and How We Collect It</p>

<p>We collect personal information in several ways from several different parts of the site.&nbsp; The information we collect includes two basic kinds: (1) information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, telephone number, or e-mail address, and (2) information that we use only as data in the aggregate.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under the age of 13.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We&nbsp;ask for and collect personal information in the following circumstances:</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">1. When you register on Amtrak.com and create a User Profile:</span> When you register on Amtrak.com and create a User Profile, we ask for the following personal information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name, title</li>

<li>Favorite departure and arrival points (optional)</li>

<li>AAA, NARP, Student Advantage, ISIC, Veterans Advantage membership numbers &nbsp;(optional)</li>

</ul>

<p>We store this information in your User Profile which allows us to provide you with better service when you make reservations online.&nbsp; We are able to pre-populate information for you during the reservations booking process, so you will not have to re-enter it each time you book a reservation.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">2. When you purchase tickets and make a reservation online:</span> We collect a certain amount of personal information about you (and, if necessary, your traveling companions) when you make reservations and purchase tickets online, whether you purchase tickets while logged in with a User Profile, or while not logged in (i.e., as a guest).&nbsp; We use this information to fulfill your booking requests.&nbsp; This information includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>

<li>E-mail address</li>

<li>Mailing address (if necessary)</li>

<li>Billing address</li>

<li>Telephone number</li>

<li>Travel and reservation information (departure and arrival points, dates of travel, train number, accommodations, names and number of travelers in your party, fares)</li>

<li>Passenger discount types (if any)</li>

<li>Ticket pick-up/delivery options</li>

<li>Promotional codes used (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use the site to purchase tickets for more than one person, we also ask for the name of each person traveling so that we may issue a ticket in each passenger's correct name.&nbsp; We do not use these names of other passengers for any other purpose.&nbsp; We may also ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you in the event that there is a major scheduling change or cancellation of your train.</p>

<p>In addition, when you purchase tickets while logged in to the Amtrak.com site with a User Profile, we also save information about your canceled reservations, if any.&nbsp; Also, if you choose, we can save trip information regarding trips that you have researched, but have not yet booked.&nbsp; You also have the option to view a list of confirmed reservations you made online, as well as any canceled trips.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">3. When you make purchases of Amtrak merchandise online:</span> We collect some personal information from you when you make purchases through our online store for the purpose of fulfilling your order.&nbsp; This information includes:</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">6. When you contact us through the site:</span> If you contact Amtrak.com through our 'Contact Us' page, we may keep a record of that correspondence which includes your e-mail address and any other information you provide to us in your correspondence.</p>

<p class="subheadblue">Section 4: With Whom We Share Your Personal Information</p>

<ul>
<li>Amtrak Guest Rewards Program management</li>

<li>Amtrak e-mail services</li>

<li>Customer data storage and processing</li>

<li>Order fulfillment</li>

<li>Amtrak Vacations</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to our contractors, we also have relationships with certain trustworthy business partners of another category who would like you to be provided with information about their various products and services that we believe would be of interest to you.&nbsp; We share your personal information with these business partners.</p>

<p>If you make a request for information about, subscribe to, or make an online purchase of, goods or services offered by one of our business partners on the Amtrak.com site, you are giving us your express permission to share your personal information with that business partner so that your request, subscription, or purchase can be fulfilled under that partner's own online privacy policies and practices.&nbsp; If you enter an Amtrak sweepstakes or contest online, your personal information may be shared with the Amtrak business partners who are co-sponsors of the sweepstakes or contest and who are likely to have different privacy policies and practices than Amtrak.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">Your California Privacy Rights:</span> If you are a California consumer, upon your request (see Section 8 of this Policy entitled ‚ÄúContacting Us Regarding This Policy‚Äù), we will disclose to you what personal information of yours was shared with what third party business partner within the last year (including disclosing to you our partner‚Äôs name and address) if such information was used by our partner for their marketing purposes.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">Data in the Aggregate:</span> We may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, a statistic indicating that 45% of our users are female) to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other selected third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">Reservation of Rights:</span> We reserve the right to disclose personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Policy or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Amtrak's rights or property, other Amtrak users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.&nbsp; We may disclose or access account information for administrative or other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain or improve our products, services or the operation of this site, for law enforcement purposes, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">Other Sites May Collect Information:</span> Please also be aware that when you click on an advertisement on another site that is linked to Amtrak.com, or when you otherwise use web sites that link to the Amtrak.com site, your personal information may be collected by those sites.&nbsp; This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any such other web sites, and we cannot accept responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of those other sites.&nbsp; Please refer to those sites' privacy policies for information about their practices.</p>

<p><span class="bluebold">Special Note for Amtrak Guest Rewards Program Members:</span> When you join the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program, you agree to allow Amtrak to share with participating business partners of the Amtrak Guest Rewards program your personal information for the purpose of providing you with information and promotions.&nbsp; Please refer to Section 9 of this Policy to learn about how the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program uses your personal information.</p>

<p class="subheadblue">Section 5: What Security Precautions We Have in Place to Protect the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Personal Information</p>

<p>When you make reservations, place orders, or access account information from the site, we use SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer") encryption technology to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information and protect your credit card information as it travels over the Internet.&nbsp; Once we receive your credit card information, it is stored offline in our secure data center.&nbsp; We protect against unauthorized access all of the customer data we collect by means of firewalls and other security<br>
measures.</p>

<p>Your User Profile Information and Amtrak Guest Rewards Membership Account Information (should you enroll in the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program) are password-protected.&nbsp; We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.&nbsp; Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window when you have finished.&nbsp; This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet "cafe."</p>

<p>When you give Amtrak personal information online, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information.&nbsp; In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of Amtrak and outside of the state where you entered that information.&nbsp; Whenever we handle personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, we take steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Amtrak.com, and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.&nbsp; However, we cannot accept liability for disclosure of any personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized ads or errors and omissions of third parties.</p>
