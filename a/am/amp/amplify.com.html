It also describes Amplify’s practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., site activity) in connection with the Site.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>As set forth in our <a href="/terms">Website Terms of Use</a>, the Site is for a general audience, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<h3>Product Information and Newsletters.</h3>

<h3>Product Orders.</h3>

<p>If you use e-commerce areas of our Site to order our products, we request information from you on our order form. To purchase products through the Site, you must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number).

For instance, you may be asked to provide your name, email address and event or webinar-related preferences to help us process your registration or content request.</p>

<h3>Social Plugins.</h3>

<p>Certain areas of our Site permit you to utilize social media functionality, such as the Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons (“Social Plugins”). To use a Social Plugin, you must authorize the third-party provider of that Social Plugin, e.g. Facebook or Google, to access, collect, and/or disclose your information related to your use of that Social Plugin, subject to that company’s privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. In addition, such providers may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on their social networking platform about your use of the Site. Such services may also employ unique identifiers that allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.</p>

<h3>Site Activity Information.</h3>

<p>When you access and interact with the Site, we and our Third Party Agents (as defined below) may collect certain information about those visits. For example, we or our Third Party Agents may receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other characteristics of the device hardware, operating system and configurations for that device.</p>

<h3>Cookies.</h3>

<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology, including cookies) may also be used. Websites send these data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or mobile or other device so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website or app. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Site and may include search queries you have run on the Site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but your browser may permit you to change your settings to notify you of a cookie being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information.

<h3>Public Areas and Discussion Forums.</h3>

<p>Any information you share in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any personal information that you expect to keep private.</p>

<h3>Contests and Sweepstakes.</h3>

<p>When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to the Site or Amplify, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for your entry will be used and disclosed.</p>

<h3>Information from Other Sources.</h3>

If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Amplify, you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@amplify.com">privacy@amplify.com</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the Site or policies.</p>

<h3>To improve our products and services.</h3>

<p>We may use your personal information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products and services, enhancing the Site, improving our services, identifying usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.</p>

<p>Amplify may share your information with Amplify’s affiliated education companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>To allow service providers to assist us.</h3>

<p>We may engage third party service providers, agents and partners (“Third Party Agents”) to perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, credit card processing, shipping or stocking orders and providing customer service. We may disclose your personal information to such Third Party Agents to enable them to assist us in these efforts.</p>

<h3>To protect the rights of Amplify and our users.</h3>

<p>There may be instances when Amplify may disclose your information, in situations where Amplify has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, operations, or property of Amplify, our parents, subsidiaries or affiliates or our or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements, including our terms of use); (ii) protect the rights, safety, privacy, security or property of users of the Site or others; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including laws outside your country of residence; (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities, including those outside your country of residence; or (vi) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>

<h3>To complete a merger or sale of assets.</h3>

<p>If Amplify sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger, transfer or other disposition of all or part of its business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Amplify may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="security">5. Security</h2>
                    <p>Amplify uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="user-control">6. User control</h2>
                    <p>If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us using the contact information provided below. In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or if you have other questions about your personal information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="data-retention">7. Data retention</h2>
                    <p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>

<p>Even after we have deleted your information from our systems, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances – where, for example, you have shared information with social media platforms and other unaffiliated services. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="sensitive-information">8. Sensitive information</h2>
