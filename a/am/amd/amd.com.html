        <p><font size="1"><b>Advanced Micro Devices Privacy Overview</b><br>
          Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is committed to respecting your privacy. 
          In general, you can visit amd.com without revealing any information 
          about yourself. AMD does collect information regarding visitors to our 
          Web site, such as domain name, number of visits, and average time spent, 
          to measure use and <u>improve the content</u> of our site. We analyze 
          this data for trends and statistics to help us provide you with better 
          service.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1"><b>Personal Information</b><br>
          There are times, however, when we may request information from you, 
          such as your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information 
          is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection 
          how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond 
          to your inquiry, participate in certain promotions, conduct a survey 
          or allow you to access specific information. If you sign up for an AMD 
          electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions 
          on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. We respect your right to choose 
          whether to give us personal information or "opt out" if you do not wish 
          to disclose personal information. We do our best to maintain the accuracy 
          of any personal information you do supply to us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1">Any information provided by you will be used for AMD's 
          purposes only. Your information will not be shared with individual or 
          other companies [such as direct mail organizations or other third parties] 
          unless required by law. However, AMD may need to provide your name and 
          delivery address to third parties that AMD uses for delivering specific 
          services to you (such as support services or shipping purposes when 
          you ask us to send something to you).</font></p>
        <p><font size="1">Our Web sites may provide links to third party sites. 
          Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review 
          the privacy policies of these third party sites.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1"><b>Security and Quality</b><br>
          AMD is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual 
          identifying information that you provide. You can help AMD update and 
          maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying 
          AMD of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. 
          In some programs, you may do this online by following the instructions 
          on membership profile pages. You may also update your information by 
          e-mailing <a href="mailto:web.feedback@amd.com">web.feedback@amd.com</a> 
          with a description or example of what you wish to change.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1"><b>Cookies</b><br>
          AMD uses cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Web site 
          are of interest to you so we can better serve and provide you with tailored 
          information from our Web. A cookie is an element of data that a Web 
          site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. 
          You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving 
          you the chance to decide whether to accept it. These cookies do not 
          track individual information. AMD may also use cookies when you register 
          for one of our web programs or extranets. In this case, a cookie will 
          store useful information that enables our Web site to remember you when 
          you return to visit, but only AMD Web sites can read that information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="1"><b>Oversight or Questions</b><br>
          AMD welcomes comments and questions on this policy. As stated above, 
          we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and will make every reasonable 
          effort to keep your information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving 
          changes on the Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will 
          be posted to this site. Questions regarding our policy should be directed
