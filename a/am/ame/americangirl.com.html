Please read Pleasant Company's <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/tools/html/safesurf.html">Web-Surfing Tips</a> for more information. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary as a condition for participating in a contest, game, or other activity. Upon proper identification, parents may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use.

Our site consists of two main areas:<br><br>
<a href="http://www.americangirl.com/homepage2.html">Fun for Girls</a>: Offers online games, polls, features, advice, and activity ideas, plus company-sponsored event listings and a peek at American Girl Place in Chicago.<br><br>

</span></p><p><span class="headline">Information We Collect from Girls in the "Fun for Girls" Section</span><br><br>
<span class="copy">The "Fun for Girls" portion of Pleasant Company's American Girl Web site is directed toward girls ages 8 and up. Pleasant Company doesn't require visitors to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy our Web site. A girl can visit the americangirl.com site without ever registering or providing personal information. In the "Fun for Girls" section, users may be asked to provide a first name, age, and state when submitting a response to one of our editorial departments: <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/help/index.html">Help From You</a>, <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/ysi/index.html">You Said It</a>, and <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/todotoday/index.html">To Do Today</a>. This information is completely voluntary. When asked for a name, girls may use "screen names" (not a real name) in order to protect their privacy. Before any responses are posted, an editor reviews all the responses received and deletes any personally identifiable information. When we post a girl's e-mailed submission to one of these departments, we use only her first name, age, and state. We obtain parental consent to post pictures of girls in "In Her Own Words," "Fan Gallery," and similar sections. Pleasant Company may collect some information from a child under age 13 without parental consent, but only in the following case: If a child sends a comment to americangirl.com through the E-mail Us form and includes an e-mail address for a response, the AmericanGirl.com customer service staff will keep that e-mail address only long enough to respond to that specific question or comment. E-mail addresses collected through the "Fun for Girls" portion of the Web site are not posted, released, sold, or distributed to anyone outside of Pleasant Company.<br><br>
We strongly advise girls to check--ALWAYS--with parents before submitting any personal information to this or any other Web site. Please see <a href="#note">A Note to Parents</a>.</span></p>

<p><span class="headline">Information We Collect Online in American Girl's E-store</span><br><br>
<span class="copy">The American Girl E-store offers the full line of American Girl products available for purchase online, including <i>American Girl</i> magazine. Customers must be over age 18 with a valid credit card. Fans under age 18 can use the Wish List function while browsing the e-store but cannot make purchases.  When a customer places an order or requests a catalogue online, we collect information we need to complete the transaction, including the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalogue request. We use Secure Sockets Layer technology to protect credit card data during transmission, and adopt careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system.<br><br>
As a convenience to customers, we do offer the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing an online order. When a customer chooses to register, we then capture his or her login name, password, name, mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses, and credit card information. When registered customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with login name and password. No customer is required to register this information.<br><br>
If a customer includes a child's birth date and e-mail address, this information will only be used to help us provide products and services that meet customer needs.<br><br>
When a customer places an online order, we will send a confirmation e-mail. We may also send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product of interest to customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mails can indicate this preference on the E-store order form. Customers who receive an e-mail from us that they would rather not receive can simply follow the unsubscribe instructions included in the e-mail.<br><br>
When a customer requests a catalogue or places an order online, we add the customer's name and address to our print catalogue mailing list. Customers who do not wish to receive our mailings can send the mailing label from their catalogue to the following address:<br><br>
American Girl
Attn: Mail Order Processing Dept.
P.O. Box 620497
Middleton, WI 53562-0497<br><br>
Customers who have recently moved or are planning a move in the near future should let us know by filling out the online <a href="pc_qc.comment_page" target="_top">Change of Address</a> form. For all mailing questions and changes, you may also call 1-800-845-0005.</span></p>

<p><span class="headline">Other Information We Collect</span><br><br>
<span class="copy">A "cookie" is a small file that is saved on a user's computer hard drive that contains no personal information. americangirl.com's cookies provide users with faster access to pages they have already visited, allow users to personalize certain pages, and keep track of a user's progress in a game. If a girl leaves the americangirl.com Web site, a cookie will "remember" what games she has already played so that she does not have to start all over again when she returns. This technology is used only on some of the games on the Web site, including <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agmg/todotoday/index.html">The American Girls Trivia Game</a>, <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agcn/molly/game2_pedalpower/">Pedal Power!</a>, and <a href="http://www.americangirl.com/agcn/kit/game2_eggs/index.html">Kit's Money Matters</a>.<br><br>
Americangirl.com also uses cookies to help determine how many people visit the site, which Web pages are visited, and how long visitors stay there. This information helps us create a better Web site by revealing which AmericanGirl.com features are a success and identifying areas that might need improvement. Cookies also help us keep track of items in the shopping cart or wish list. For administrative purposes, each visitor's IP address is collected. An IP address is the automatic number assigned to each user's computer when that person surfs the Web. Certain Internet Service Providers, like America Online, may assign the same IP address to many users. The IP addresses collected are counted as the number of "hits" on the site. A user's IP address is not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information like a name and address, so every user remains anonymous.<br><br>
Pleasant Company does not sell or release any information gathered in the "Fun for Girls" section to any third parties. We do post some identifiable information such as photos in some areas (Fan Gallery and In Her Own Words), but only with parental consent. All information gathered online will be used only by Pleasant Company for internal marketing analyses and to improve products, services, and the Web site. Under special circumstances, we may give other companies access to our information database, but only when needed to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, to help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services to us. If we do provide access, we require those companies outside our family of companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see.<br><br>
If we believe that anyone's behavior on our sites may damage us, our sites, or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the user, contact him or her, and/or bring legal action against him or her. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request.<br><br>
Thanks for reading our privacy statement. We are genuinely committed to safeguarding online privacy for both you and your children. We hope you have a better understanding of the many activities offered on our Web site. Remember, we may change our policy from time to time. When this happens, we will notify you of the new policy by posting it on our site.<br><br>
If you have concerns about your child's use of our service, please contact us using our <a href="/pls/ag/pc_qc.comment_page">feedback form</a>. Your child's use of this site is also governed by our <a href="icm_terms">Terms and Conditions</a> statement. Please read it.<br><br>
