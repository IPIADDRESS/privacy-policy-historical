<p>When you visit and interact with this Site, we and third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services to us, may collect non-personal information (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit).</p>
<p>As with many other sites, our Site may use "cookies" or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your reservations or requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit our Site. If you want to remove cookies at any time from your computer, you can delete them using your browser (consult your browser's "help" menu to learn how to delete cookies).</p>
<p>We also may collect data by using "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") that allow us to know when you visit our Site.

<p>In addition, we may use third party advertisers to serve advertisements on the Sites.

We do not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose.
