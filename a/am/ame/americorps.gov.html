Thank you for visiting the Corporation for National Service's website. This policy explains how the Corporation will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our website. The information we receive depends on what you do when visiting our site. It can be categorized as <b>anonymous information</b> (which cannot be tied back to you as an individual) or <b>personally identifiable information</b> (which tells us specifically who you are, e.g., your name, phone number, e-mail or postal address). <br><br>

Anonymous and personally identifiable information are collected and used in the following ways:<br><br>

<b>Browsing or Downloading</b><br>
If you browse through our site to browse or download information, we collect the following anonymous information: 1) the name of the domain from which you access the Internet; 2) the date and time you access our site; and 3) the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.  <br><br>

<b>Sending Us an E-mail</b><br>
You also may decide to send us personally identifying information. Any information that we collect may be subject to disclosure, but will be handled in accordance with the requirements of the <a href="about/policies.html">Privacy Act</a>, and the <a href="about/foia/index.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> to ensure the greatest protection of personal privacy in the face of any required disclosure. Except as might be required by law, we do not share any information we receive with any outside parties.<br><br> 

<b>Registering and applying for AmeriCorps</b>

<b>Use of Cookies<br>
What is a cookie?</b>
A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your browser, along with a Web page, when you access a Website. There are two kinds of cookies. A <b>session cookie</b> is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's RAM. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A <b>persistent cookie</b> is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive. If you have your browser set to notify you before accepting cookies the notice will tell you if the cookie expires some time in the future or not. Persistent cookies have an expiration date in the future. Session cookies have no date associated with them.<br><br>

<b>The Corporation for National Service website does not use persistent cookies.</b> If your browser accepts cookies we may use cookies to secure the connection during a session visit. Only when entering a specific session or page, will a cookie be enabled to ensure your visit is secure. The cookie will be deleted when the visitor ends the session. To ensure your session has ended, close your browser.<br><br>

<b>Site Management</b><br>
For site management, information is collected for statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. This information is only used internally, does not contain personal identifiers, and will only be used for internal management purposes.
