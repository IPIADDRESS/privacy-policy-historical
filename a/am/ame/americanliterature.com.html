<h4>
Children's Guidelines
</h4>

<p>

	    We care about children and understand that they have
            special privacy needs.  Therefore, we have adopted the following
            privacy policy regarding children:
	  
</p><ol>
<li>
We will NOT collect, use, or distribute to third parties
             personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental
             consent.
</li>
<li>
We will NOT give the child access to unmonitored chat
             rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services that would
             give the child the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute
             personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental
             consent
</li>
<li>
When verifiable parental consent is not obtained, we
             will only use the online contact information (such as email) to:
  	    
<ol type="a">
<li>
Respond directly to the child's request on a one-time
             basis and not use that information to re-contact the
             child for other purposes.
</li>
<li>
Request the name or online contact information of a
             parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental
             consent or providing parental notification.
</li>
<li>
Respond more than once directly to a specific request
             from a child (such as in the case where a child requests
             a newsletter subscription) and not used to re-contact the
             child for other purposes.  We will use our best efforts
             to provide parental notification, which will include the
             nature and intended use as well as an opportunity for the
             parent to prevent the use of the information and
             participation in the activity.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
We will NOT entice the child to divulge more information than
      is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
</li>
<li>
We will provide the parent a description of the specific
      types of a personally identifiable information collected from
      their child upon request.  We will allow the parent to refuse
      further use or future online collection of personally
      identifiable information and provide a way for a parent to
      obtain any personally identifiable information collected from
      their child.
</li>
<li>
We will provide notice to children in age appropriate
      terms of what personally identifiable information is to be
      collected.
</li>
<li>
We will NOT provide any links to Web sites that are
      unsuitable for children.
</li>
<li>
We will encourage children to get their parent's
      permission before sharing personal information online.
</li>
</ol>
