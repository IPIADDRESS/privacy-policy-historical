But next time the two blonde reality stars need to rip each other's extensions off and hit each other with their Marc Jacobs shoe before re-applying make-up and heading straight to the police station. Paris Hilton and Shanna Moakler, ex-wife of Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker, were recently involved in a fight during the early hours of Wednesday morning.
</p><p class="left-text">Paris - who was recently spotted kissing Travis - filed a police report in the early hours alleging that Moakler punched her in the jaw at Los Angeles' Hyde nightclub.
</p><p class="left-text">Meanwhile, Shanna gave a police statement claiming that Paris' ex-boyfriend, Stavros Niarchos, pushed her down some stairs.
</p><p class="left-text">The "Simple Life" star's publicist, Elliot Mintz, claims that at approximately 1:10 am his client was approached by Shanna who screamed obscenities at her and then punched her in the face.
</p><p class="left-text">Mintz added that Shanna had to be restrained by several people to allow Paris - who he insists never retaliated against her assailant - to leave the nightclub.
