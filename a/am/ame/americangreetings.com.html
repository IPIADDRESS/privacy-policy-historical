<br> 
<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">We gather certain generic information with respect to visitors' use of the Site such as the number of visitors, the frequency with which they visit and the areas on the Site that they favor, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This collective data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of the Site, which, in turn, enables us to make the Site as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We also may provide aggregate statistical "ratings" to our AmericanGreetings.com Partners about how our customers, collectively, use the Site. We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of our Site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well.  <strong>These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.</strong></font>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">AmericanGreetings.com uses a technology nicknamed "cookies." Cookies are pieces of information, or data, sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Americangreetings.com uses cookies to make visiting our Site easier. For example, the cookies that we place on your hard drive allow us to save passwords for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit. In addition, we also use cookies to help us track how many unique visitors we have to our sites, as a type of aggregate counter. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on our Site if you choose not to accept the cookies we send to your computer. AmericanGreetings.com cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and <strong>we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or what your email address or screen name is.</strong></font><br><br>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="4" color="#000000"><strong>How We Collect and Use Information When You Send a Greeting 
</strong></font><br> 
 
<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">When you send or share one of our online greetings, print a personalized Create &amp; Printâ„¢ card or order a personalized paper card from our service, the information you provide to us is used solely to customize your greeting with the recipient's name and with your message, and to deliver an email notification to the recipient and provide confirmation notices to you. <strong>We treat our greetings products as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient</strong> and will not disclose the contents of any greetings product other than to the intended recipient, except under the specific situations outlined in <a href="#special">Special Disclosure Exceptions</a>, below. Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents of the online greetings you send. On occasion, however, AmericanGreetings.com personnel may need to view your message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service representatives to help you send a greeting or to verify that a greeting was sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card, including the recipient's email address and the message. For more details about your rights and responsibilities regarding the use of our site, please review our <a href="http://www.americangreetings.com/legal.pd">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br> 
 
In addition, we try to personalize your Site experience by using the types of greetings, cards and games you have sent and gifts you have purchased in the past in order to shape our recommendations about the greetings, cards, games, and gifts and other merchandise that might be of interest to you on an ongoing basis. These recommendations may be presented to you as email communications if you have opted-in to receive email or in the form of web site banners, buttons or contextual text links. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and Site usage to help us enhance the design and layout of the Site and make it easier for you to navigate the Site. 
<br><br> 
 
When you use our service to send an online greeting we may collect your email address and communicate to you through email greetings and newsletters. These emails may communicate holiday wishes, free gifts, news and special announcements or invitations to become a member. Each of these messages will provide information on how to unsubscribe from future emails. For instructions on how to opt-out of future email communications, see <a href="#changing">Changing Your Status</a>, below.</font><br><br>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="4" color="#000000"><strong>How We Collect and Use Information on Members and Contest Entrants</strong></font><br> 
<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">If you elect to become a member of AmericanGreetings.com, either through a paid subscription or a free membership, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information such as name, address, email address, zip code, gender and age range. Paid subscribers are required to provide the foregoing information as well as certain credit card information and the corresponding billing address. Our registration process also allows you to provide us with permission to send you our email newsletter as well as other promotional emails from AmericanGreetings.com or our sponsors and partners. The registration process also asks for additional information regarding your preferences and interests; this information, however, is not required for membership and is completely optional on your part. All information requested from you during the registration process is clearly marked as required or optional, as applicable.<br><br> 
 
If personal information is a requirement of a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion sponsored by AmericanGreetings.com, then your entry will be automatic when you provide this information. By entering a contest or promotion, you agree to all of the terms and conditions of that effort, which will be clearly outlined in the rules. In all cases, the rules governing the specific promotion or contest will clearly outline the intended use of any information collected and will include a link to this Privacy Policy page.<br><br> 
 
In general, we use the information we collect on free and paid members and contest entrants in the following ways:  
<ul> 
	<li>To provide a more personalized site experience through recommendations of greetings, gifts, games, promotions and offers that the member may be interested in;  
	</li><li>To send the member news and information about AmericanGreetings.com;  
	</li><li>To contact the member for feedback and surveys; and  
	</li><li>If the member chooses, to send promotions and offers based on the member's interests;  
</li></ul> 
We do not send or share any of our members' personal information with third parties without the member's permission. However, there may be special circumstance under which we are required to do so. Please refer to <a href="#special">Special Disclosure Exceptions</a>, below.<br><br>  During our member registration process, potential members may be asked whether they want us to share their contact and profile information with third parties or sponsors-generally companies which sell consumer products and services about which our users may be interested. We may also provide our members with opportunities at other times to receive information about additional products and services, but we will never share a member's personal information with third parties unless the member grants us permission to do so. Even if a member grants us permission to share the member's information with third parties, the member may, at any time, revoke the that permission; see <a href="#changing">Changing Your Status</a>, below.<br><br> 
 
<strong><i>Reminder Service Information</i></strong><br> 
Additional information may be collected on members in the various categories of our Reminder service for which a member may elect to sign-up. For example, a member may ask that we store his or her children's ages and dates of birth (for Birthday reminders), holidays about which the member would like to receive reminders, personal interests and other reminder requests. We use this data to tailor the member's experience through our Reminders emails. By obtaining this information, we can provide our members with specific content that we think they might be interested in, according to their preferences and interests. None of this information is required to use our service or to become a member; however, the omission of certain types of data will limit the value of becoming a member of AmericanGreetings.com and the value of the Reminder service. As a result, the more information we have about a member, the more valuable we hope the AmericanGreetings.com experience will be for that member.</font><br><br>

IIn addition, AmericanGreetings.com has several special relationships with other web sites ("Partners"). In some instances, the site or area of the site is "co-branded" or "powered by" with a Partner's logo or a Partner's name may appear in the URL. When you provide registration data or send greetings on a co-branded site or area, personal and/or aggregate data may be shared with that partner. You should review the individual privacy policies of these partners and make an informed decision about whether to continue. You may opt-out of sharing your information with that partner by choosing not to register or use that site or service.

<strong><i>Special Disclosure Exceptions</i></strong> 
In some cases, we may disclose your personal information with other third parties if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to:  
 
<ul> 
	<li>Comply with the law;  
	</li><li>Protect and defend our rights and property;   
	</li><li> Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site and/or AmericanGreetings.com services; or

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">AmericanGreetings.com is committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online.

If the potential member indicates that they are under 13, they will not be permitted to register with AmericanGreetings.com. In addition, if after registration, we receive notice that the member is actually under 13 years old, we will immediately close their account and delete their personal information.<br><br>
