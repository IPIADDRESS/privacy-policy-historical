<h2>CISCO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>Cisco respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information 
that you share with us.  Generally, you can browse through our website without giving 
us any information about yourself.   When we do need your personal information to 
provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal 
information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>

<h3>Information Collection</h3>
<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an 
individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email address, a 
home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, birth date, 
gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other information when needed to 
provide a service you requested.</p>
<p>When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously 
indicated that you wish Cisco to remember your login and password. We don't collect 
personal information, including your email address.  We do log your IP address (the 
Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you 
visit and how long you spend there.  But we do not link your IP address to any 
personal information unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other 
commercial websites, the Cisco website may use a standard technology called a 
"cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to "<a href="#cookies">Cookies and 
Tracking Information</a>" below for more information.</p>
<p>Cisco collects personal information when you register with Cisco for a Cisco 
account, when you use certain Cisco products or services, when you register to attend 
a seminar or participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an email 
or other mailing list, or you submit an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotions, 
or when you submit your information to Cisco for any other reason.   From time to 
time, Cisco receives personal information from business partners and vendors.  Cisco 
only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable 
privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.</p>
<p>Access to certain Cisco web pages require a login and a password.  The use of those 
web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from those sites, may be 
governed by a written agreement between your employer and Cisco. Your personal 
information may be retained by Cisco to verify compliance with the agreement, log 
software licenses granted, to track software downloaded from those pages, or track 
usage of other applications available on those pages.</p>

<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of 
collection the purpose for the collection.  Cisco does not intend to transfer your 
personal information to third parties without your consent, except under the limited 
conditions described under the discussion entitled "<a href="#information_sharing">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a>" 
below.</p>
<p> If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may transfer that 
information, within Cisco or to Cisco's third party service providers, including 
across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions 
around the world.</p>
<p>We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing 
or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to 
collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take 
affirmative action to indicate that you do not consent, for instance by clicking or 
checking the appropriate option or box at the point of collection.  In some cases, 
when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in."  This means we 
will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your 
information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.</p>

<a name="cookies"><h3>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h3></a> 
<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you
visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses
to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can
contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk
or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of Cisco's website uses cookies 
to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our 
website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in
helping users reach that information.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you can set your 
browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser 
alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in 
your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of Cisco's website 
if you do so.  You do not need to have cookies turned on to use/navigate through many 
parts of our website, except access to certain of Cisco's web pages require a login 
and password.</p>

<h3>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
<p>Cisco uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for 
certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep 
you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers 
or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our 
business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better 
services.  We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business 
partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.</p>

<a name="information_sharing"><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3></a>
<p>Because Cisco is a global company, your personal information may be shared with 
other Cisco offices or subsidiaries around the world.  All such entities are governed 
by this Privacy Policy and/or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality and data 
transfer agreements.</p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared outside Cisco without your permission, 
except under conditions explained below.  Inside Cisco, data is stored in controlled 
servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the United 
States or any other country where Cisco, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are 
located.</p>
<p>Cisco may send your personal information to other companies or people under any of 
the following circumstances: when we have your consent to share the information; we 
need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Cisco to provide a 
product or service to you (we will only provide those companies the information they 
need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for 
any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, 
software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear 
about either from us or from our business partners.  We will also disclose your 
personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce our <a href="/public/copyright.html">Terms of Use</a>, or in 
urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our websites.</p>

<h3>Your Ability to Review and Delete Your Account and Information</h3> 
<p>If you are a registered CCO user, you can review your personal information by 
accessing <a href="/common/profile.shtml">www.cisco.com/common/profile.shtml</a>. 
You may also request deletion of your Cisco account or any of your personal 
information held by us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@cisco.com">privacy@cisco.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>Your Cisco account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. 
Cisco safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and 
managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, Cisco uses industry-standard 
SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions.  While we strive to 
protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information 
you transmit to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your 
personal data when you are on the Internet.  Change your passwords often, use a 
combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>

<h3>Children and Privacy</h3>
<p>Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under the age 
of 13.  Cisco does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the 
age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.</p>

<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
<p>Cisco's website contains links to other sites. Cisco does not share your personal 
information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. 
We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>

<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Cisco will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes 
in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by 
posting a notice on this site.</p>

<h3>Questions or Suggestions</h3>
If you have questions or concerns about our collection, use, or disclosure of your 
personal information, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cisco.com">privacy@cisco.com</a>.<p></p>
