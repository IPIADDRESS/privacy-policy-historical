    <h3>Information We Collect About You Online</h3>
    <p>We want you to get the most out of your visits to our website. From offering
      special promotions to new users, to providing Ameriprise Financial clients
      with secure online account access and management options, we strive to
      make the most of every unique users visit to our website. To provide our
      users with these and other online tools, we will, from time to time request
      that you provide us with your personal information, such as your name,
      address, email address and telephone number. We may also receive your contact
      information via a third-party website if you request information about
      financial products and services on another website.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Website users:</strong> We will ask you for certain contact
        information when you register for online services and products.</li>
      <li><strong>Ameriprise Financial clients:</strong> We will ask you for
        certain personal information if you want to access your Ameriprise Financial
        accounts online or request online services and products so we can provide
        you with secure online account access or the requested services or products.
        In some instances, we will need to supplement the information you provided
        with certain personal information about you obtained from third parties
        to process your online transaction, such as a credit check when applying
        for a brokerage margin account.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will maintain information about your account, online account activity,
      online services and products requested and your usage of our website to
      help us administer your online account needs and to continually improve
      your online experience by providing you with customized, relevant information
      and offers.</p>
    <p><strong>TO PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER 13:</strong> We do not knowingly
      solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of
      13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and
      believe that personal information may have been collected about such child,
      please see <a href="#b2">How We Use The Information We Collect</a> and <a href="#a3">Your
      Opt-Out Choices</a>.</p>

    <h3>How We Use The Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>Whether you are a new website user or an Ameriprise Financial client,
      we use personal information collected on our website to handle the transactions
      you initiate. In some instances, we will share your contact information
      with carefully selected service providers to assist us in processing your
      online transactions or to deliver the services products, and marketing
      you request online. For example, in order to mail you the financial guide
      you request online, we will supply your contact information to a third
      party vendor who will process and mail the guide, and other materials you
      request on the behalf of Ameriprise Financial.</p>
    <p>We will also share your personal information with carefully selected non-affiliated
      companies who provide transactional services or send offers on behalf of
      Ameriprise Financial. For example, Ameriprise Financial may offer frequent
      flyer miles to prospective clients upon meeting with an advisor for a complimentary
      consultation. Consumers who accept the offer and meet with an advisor will
      have their information shared with the airline company only for purposes
      of ensuring that the consumers receive the miles in their frequent flyer
      accounts.</p>
    <p>In an effort to ensure that you get the most out of your visits to our
      website, we may use your personal information in combination with other
      information we have about you as an Ameriprise Financial client and information
      provided to us by third parties to present you with customized and relevant
      information and offers. For example, we may send offers pertinent to your
      home ownership that may help you protect your assets.</p>
    <p>To better meet your overall financial needs, we may also share your information
      with our affiliates who we believe can offer complementary services or
      products to our clients or that we believe may be of particular interest
      to Ameriprise Financial clients.</p>

    <h3>Tracking Activity On Our Website</h3>
    <p>In order to make your visit to our website as productive as possible,
      we track activity on our website. However, we want you to know that the
      tracking technology we use does not identify any personal information about
      you. They cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses,
      or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address,
      phone number, or email address. We only know who you are if you tell us.
      You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as name,
      address, phone number or email address to us when you register for online
      services or products.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> One way we track activity is by using cookies.
        A "cookie" is an electronic file that holds small strings of
        text. When you visit our website, we send a cookie to your browser so
        that we can recognize it when you or another user of your computer return
        to our website. We want to recognize your browser so we can make the
        best use of your time when visiting our website. For example, when you
        visit our website, we present an introductory page to all new users.
        The fact that you have already visited the introductory page is recorded
        in a cookie so you won't see the introductory page again. For your security,
        if you are registered for online services and/or have an account with
        Ameriprise Financial we can not give you access to your account information
        on our website unless your browser is set to accept cookies from us.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: When you visit our website by clicking
        on certain banner ads or special offers on our partners' website, we
        track this information to improve navigation and deliver relevant information
        when you arrive at our website. We also do this because we want to determine
        if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users.<br>
        <br>
        In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie
        may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web
        beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize
        our online advertising. These web beacons enable us to learn which ads
        we place on third-party sites bring users to our website. They do not
        capture or convey any personal or sensitive information about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser settings</strong>: You can adjust many browser preferences
        so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust
        preferences to decline cookies altogether. Recognize that cookies enable
        you to visit our website without reviewing introductory information.
        In addition to allowing us to recognize you, cookies also enable us to
        securely provide our registered users with account information.</li>

    <h3>How We Use Your Email Address</h3>
    <p>We recognize that email can be the preferred mode of communication for
      some of our website users. If you provide us with your email address when
      registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account
      online, we will use it to contact you about online services and products
      for which you have registered or about your account.</p>
    <p><strong>We may use your email address to send you the following types
        of email messages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service notifications related to your accounts(s) </li>
      <li>Regularly scheduled email newsletters related to Ameriprise Financial</li>
      <li>Products or services you are enrolled in</li>
      <li>Optional email communications which you have signed up for (e.g., newsletters
        on a selected financial topic)</li>
      <li>Occasional updates about our products and services as well as Ameriprise
        Financial marketing offers</li>
      <li>Valuable offers from non-affiliated companies that we send you on their
        behalf</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, once you have requested information from us, we may communicate
      with you via email regarding your request to provide additional information
      related to your initial information request. For example, we may send you
      materials to help you prepare for an upcoming meeting with an Ameriprise
      financial advisor. However, we will never ask you to send personal information
      such as account or Social Security numbers by non-secure email.</p>
    <p>To make our email offers more relevant to you, we may use information
      you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information
      we have about you as an Ameriprise Financial client and information available
      from external sources such as census bureau data.</p>
    <p>We do not share your email address with non-affiliated companies for them
      to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner
      with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services
      we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
    <p>You may receive email offers from other companies for Ameriprise Financial
      products and services if you registered to receive third-party offers on
      their website, or if you receive ongoing email newsletters from the other
      companies that include third-party ads. If you have recently opted out
      of receiving email offers from Ameriprise Financial, we will process and
      honor your request as soon as administratively possible. In certain circumstances,
      you may receive email offers for Ameriprise Financial products and services
      from other companies during the time period when we are processing your
      opt-out request.</p>
    <p>To opt-out of receiving offers or email newsletters from other companies,
      follow the instructions provided by those companies.</p>

    <h3>Ads That Link To Our Website</h3>
    <p>Ameriprise Financial may use third parties to place banner ads on other
      websites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use
      of Ad Servers. We do not provide Ad Servers with your personal information
      and Ad Servers do not collect your personal information.</p>

  <h2 class="page-subheader">How We Safeguard Your Information</h2>
  <div class="component-box">
    <p>Ameriprise Financial realizes how important security is to you, so we've
      taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential
      information sent to, or from Ameriprise Financial over the Internet. First,
      we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure
      Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. This is done any time you supply or access
      personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas.</p>
    <p>SSL Technology creates a private conversation that only your computer
      and Ameriprise Financial systems can understand. The SSL Technology encodes
      information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer
      and Ameriprise Financial systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted
      information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components:
      an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" 
      that establishes a secure connection to Ameriprise Financial Web server
      systems. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser
      support 128-bit encryption.</p>
    <p>In order to securely access your personal information via our website,
      you will need the latest browser version available with SSL and 128 bit
      encryption capabilities.</p>
    <p>Second, many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password
      as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential
      information. This allows Ameriprise Financial to verify who you are, thereby
      allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized
      access.</p>
    <p>When you have finished using a secure area of Ameriprise Financial, make
      sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on
      the top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure transactions
      can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. This also
      helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from
      your computer.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page
      as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's
      temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" 
      button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in
      no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password. If
      you use a computer in a public place to access your account information,
      simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility
      of anyone else viewing your confidential information.</p>
    <p>Third, in order to bring you the many online products and services offered
      on <a href="http://www.ameriprise.com">ameriprise.com</a>, we work with
      carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to
      share any information with these companies in order to provide a product
      or service to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information
      and security systems and practices, and require administrative, technical,
      and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of Ameriprise
      Financial client information. At any time, we may audit these companies
      to verify the continued security of their systems and practices.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to
      from the Ameriprise Financial site or an Ameriprise Financial email may
      contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy
      Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review
      the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.</p>

  <h2 class="page-subheader">Your Opt-Out Choices</h2>
  <div class="component-box">
    <p>We strive to send you email communications that are informative and relevant,
      but also appreciate that you are in the best position to evaluate the type
      and frequency of our communications to you.</p>
    <p>There are two types of email communications we will send to you: service
      communications and marketing communications. Service communications may
      include information about your online registration, verification that your
      account has been accessed online, in response to a service related inquiry
      or confirmation of an online transaction. Marketing communications may
      include information about Ameriprise Financial services and products, newsletters,
      and joint or special offers or information from our selected non-affiliated
      companies and Ameriprise Financial affiliates.</p>
    <p>To opt-out of receiving email offers or newsletters, <a href="https://www16.ameriprise.com/emailcpt/ameriprise_emailprivacy_us.jsp">click
        here</a>. All email offers and email newsletters sent to you by Ameriprise
        Financial provide instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future
        offers or newsletters. These instructions are located at the bottom of
        the email message. You may receive separate newsletters pertaining to
        different Ameriprise Financial products and services that you are enrolled
        in automatically when you register for those products or services. In
        this case, you must reply to and decline the newsletters individually.
        If you opt-out, we will still send you email with service updates as
        well as other important information related to the Ameriprise Financial
        online products or services for which you have signed up.</p>

    <h3>Identity Theft 101</h3>
    <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name or personal information,
      such as your Social Security number, driver's license number, credit card
      number, telephone number or other account numbers, without your permission.
      Identity thieves use this information to open credit accounts, bank accounts,
      telephone service accounts, and make major purchases — all in your
      name. Information can be used to take over your existing accounts, or to
      open new accounts. Identity theft can result in damage to your credit rating
      and denials of credit and job offers.</p>
    <p><strong>EXAMPLE #1</strong> - One evening, you sit down to pay your monthly
      bills. You write the checks, toss the statements in the trash and put the
      container out on the curb for the morning's trash pick-up. While you sleep, 
      "dumpster-divers" go through your trash looking for the papers
      you've thrown away. They discover a gold mine of information that can be
      used for fraudulent purposes — your name, address, phone number,
      utility service account numbers, credit card numbers, and your Social Security
      number.</p>
    <p><strong>EXAMPLE #2</strong> - You receive an email message from what appears
      to be your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The message requests that you
      update the information they have on file about you — your name, credit
      card number, bank account number, etc. — by replying to the email
      or going to a specific website address to provide the information. However,
      neither the message nor the website address is from your ISP. They belong
      to someone who wants to get your information to steal your identity.</p>

    <h3>Preventing Identity Theft</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Secure your personal information at home and at work.</strong> Consider
        keeping your sensitive personal information such as bank, mortgage, and
        credit card statements, Social Security cards, and other documents and
        passwords, in a safe location accessible only to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect yourself online: </strong> Avoid accessing your financial
        accounts online from public computers at libraries, hotel business centers
        or at airports. These are prime target areas for thieves using keystroke
        monitoring tools to steal your usernames and passwords. Use firewalls,
        anti-spyware and anti-virus software to protect your home computer and
        regularly update these programs. For more information and helpful tips
        visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/onlinebrokerage.htm">SEC
        website</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasd.com/InvestorInformation/InvestorAlerts/TradingSecurities/ProtectYourOnlineBrokerageAccountSafetyShouldComeFirstWhenLoggingInandOut/index.htm">NASD
        site</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Shred documents containing your personal information before
          discarding them.</strong> Identity thieves have been known to “dumpster
          dive” to obtain discarded documents with personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Obtain your credit report from each of the three major credit
          bureaus once every six to 12 months.</strong> Review these reports
          for any inaccurate information, or any transactions that you were not
          aware of or did not authorize. You may wish to consider occasionally
          reviewing Credit Bureau Reports on your children. Identity thieves
          have been known to steal children's Social Security numbers in order
          to create fraudulent accounts, as their information is not likely to
          be reviewed regularly.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid giving out personal information over the phone</strong> especially
        when the telephone call is initiated by another party. Identity thieves
        may pose as a representative of a legitimate organization with whom you
        do business and may contact you to "verify" your information.</li>
      <li><strong>Before disclosing any personal information,</strong> make sure
        you know why it is required and how it will be used.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not give out your Social Security number</strong> to people
        or companies that you do not know.</li>
      <li><strong>Carry only the information you need.</strong> Only take with
        you the credit cards you need, and avoid carrying your Social Security
        card, your birth certificate or passport, except when necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Have the Postal Service hold your mail if you are going to
          be gone for a few days or more.</strong> Since identity thieves have
          been known to obtain personal information by collecting an individual's
          mail, promptly remove your incoming mail from your mailbox and place
          outgoing mail in post office collection boxes. Have the Postal Service
          hold your mail at the post office if you are planning on being away
          for any period of time. Install a locking mailbox if mail theft is
          a problem in your neighborhood.</li>
      <li><strong>Create unique passwords and personal identification numbers
          (PINs)</strong> and avoid using easily available information such as
          mother's maiden name, date of birth, or the last four digits of your
          Social Security number. Use passwords on your banking and brokerage
          accounts, and update all of your passwords regularly.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you need further guidance, you may wish to consult the consumer affairs
      office of the company involved, the U.S. Better Business Bureau, or your
      local or state consumer protection agency.</p>

    <h3>Detecting Identify Theft</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, detecting identity theft can be fairly simple for diligent
      consumers. Just follow these three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Contact the Credit Bureaus</strong></p>
        <p>First contact each of the three national bureaus and request copies
          of your credit report.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Review Your Credit Reports</strong></p>
        <p>Review all three of your credit reports carefully and make sure you:</p>
        <p>Recognize all accounts listed in your report and confirm that the
          balances are in line with your records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize all persons and entities that have requested or received
            a copy of your report. (If you do not recognize a person or entity,
            you may want to inquire further).</li>
          <li>Find no inquiries to your credit report for loans or accounts you
            did not apply for. (If there are accounts you do not recognize, this
            may be a sign that an identity thief has fraudulently opened an account
            in your name).</li>
          <li>Confirm there are no addresses listed for places you have never
            lived. (If there are addresses you do not recognize, this may be
            a sign that an identity thief has redirected your mail).</li>
          <li>Check that your Social Security number and employment history are
            accurate.</li>
          <li>Check that all this information is consistent across all three
            credit bureaus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Correct Your Information</strong></p>
        <p>If you find any incorrect or suspicious information, contact the credit
          bureau(s) immediately. If the incorrect or suspicious information concerns
          a particular creditor, you will want to contact that creditor as well.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Restoring your good name</h3>
    <p>These step-by-step guidelines were developed by the FTC, and are provided
      by Ameriprise Financial to help you repair the damage caused by identity
      theft. Here you'll find contact information on the relevant authorities,
      forms and sample documents you can download, as well as useful identity
      theft links. More information is available from your local police and the
      agencies themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Contact the police</strong><br>
      Contacting the police allows them to start investigating the crime. You
        will also want to obtain a copy of the police report, the police report
        number, and the name of the investigator. Banks, credit card companies,
        and other agencies may require this information as proof of a crime.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When filing a police report, provide as much documentation as you can
        to prove you have been a victim of identity theft. Documentation including
        collection letters, credit reports, and an Identity Theft Affidavit can
        help the police create a thorough report.</li>
      <li>If the identity theft occurred while you were away from home, you may
        also need to file a police report in the jurisdiction where the theft
        actually occurred.</li>
      <li>Get a copy of the police report to submit to your creditors and others
        that may require proof of a crime.</li>
      <li>Be persistent if necessary. You may be told they cannot provide a report.
        Be sure to let the police know that you need a report to provide to other
        agencies in order to resolve the identity dispute. If your local police
        will not file a report, contact the county and state police. You may
        also ask that they file a Miscellaneous Incident Report instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Contact the credit bureaus</strong><br>
      Notify the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, Trans Union)
        that you have been a victim of identity theft and request that your file
        be flagged with a "Fraud Alert." Fraud Alerts expire after
        six months, so you may want to ask how you can extend it if needed.</p>
    <p>Request copies of your credit report from each bureau to review. If information
      contained within your report is inaccurate, you may dispute it and request
      that it be changed. Request your credit report again in a few months. This
      will help you confirm that the requested changes have been made and whether
      your report has been changed without your knowledge. This may also identify
      additional occurrences of identity theft.</p>

      <a href="http://www.transunion.com">www.transunion.com</a></p>
    <p>You may also want to file a "Victim Statement" with the bureaus
      asking them to notify you before any new accounts are opened or any existing
      accounts are changed in your name. This may reveal illicit attempts to
      open additional accounts in your name.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Close Suspect Accounts</strong><br>
      Close the accounts you know or suspect involve identity fraud. </p>
    <p><strong>Checks:</strong> If your checks have been stolen or you suspect
      they have been misused, contact your financial institution to stop payments.
      Familiarize yourself with your state's laws concerning stolen and forged
      checks. You can contact your State Attorney General's office or local consumer
      protection agency to find out about any laws in your state related to identity
      fraud. Most states hold the financial institution responsible for losses
      related to a forged check. However, it may be your responsibility to notify
      the financial institution of the possible forgery in a timely manner.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may also want to contact the major check verification companies
        directly. These companies can alert retailers who use their databases
        not to accept your checks:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Telecheck: (800) 710-9898<br>
      Certegy, Inc: (800) 437-5120 </p>
    <ul>
      <li> You can also find out if the thief has been passing bad checks on
        your account by calling SCAN at (800) 262-7771.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Credit Accounts and ATM Cards: <br>
      </strong>Report the incident to all institutions with which you hold credit
      card and ATM cards. Ask the financial institution or agency to send you
      a fraud dispute form to complete. When reopening new accounts, be sure
      to use new PINs to reduce the risk of future identity theft.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your financial institution is not assisting you with the issues
        related to your identity theft, you may contact the agency with jurisdiction
        over your financial institution. If you are not sure what agency has
        jurisdiction over your particular financial institution, you can find
        out by visiting <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/enforcement.htm">www.ffiec.gov/enforcement.htm</a>.</li>
      <li>If you suspect your investment or brokerage accounts have been altered
        without your permission, report it to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        You can file a report using their online Complaint Center at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml">www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that each creditor may have its own process for handling
        a case of identity theft. Therefore, be sure to specifically ask each
        creditor what its process is, what is expected of you, and what you can
        expect from them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4. Contact the authorities</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong><br>
      FTC counselors can take your report and provide additional advice on how
        to proceed if you believe you may have been a victim of identity theft.

    <h3>What is phishing?</h3>
    <p>Phishing (pronounced "fishing") refers to fraudulent
        communications designed to deceive consumers into divulging personal,
        financial, or account information. Phishing emails often appear to come
        from legitimate financial institutions or retailers. Such requests may
        ask for information including account numbers, passwords, user names
        or Social Security numbers.</p>
    <p>These fraudulent emails often create a false sense of urgency
        intended to provoke the recipient to take immediate action; for example,
        phishing emails frequently instruct recipients to "validate" or "update" 
      account information or face cancellation. In addition, marketing offers
      may also be used for attempted phishing. Phishers use a variety of techniques,
      which may include false "From" addresses, authentic-looking logos,
      or Web links and graphics. These techniques mislead consumers into believing
      that they are dealing with a legitimate request for sensitive information.</p>
    <p>Attachments within an email can also facilitate phishing. Do not
        open attachments in unfamiliar emails, as they may place programs known
        as "key stroke loggers" on your PC, which capture keystrokes you make
        (including when you logon to a site and enter your password). The data
        obtained can then be used to commit fraud.</p>

    <h3>What does phishing look like?</h3>
    <p>The nature of phishing schemes has evolved and is likely to continue to
      do so in the future. Currently, online/email phishing is best described
      by the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails using company logos and familiar language reporting a problem
        and asking you to update your account information by prompt return email
        or by filling out a website form.</li>
      <li>Emails with attachments asking you to install software so that fraudsters
        can use it to record your key strokes (called Keystroke Logging) and
        online activity.</li>
      <li>Emails that contain typographical or grammatical errors. Spelling errors
        allow fraudsters to bypass spam filters used by Internet Service Providers
        (ISPs).</li>
      <li>Windows that pop up over a legitimate company's website asking you
        to enter personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    <div> <a class="btp" href="#a5">Back to Top</a>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>
    <a name="d3" id="d3"></a>
    <h3>How does phishing work?</h3>
    <p>Phishing works by making an email or website appear to be legitimate,
      thereby providing potential victims with a false sense of security. The
      email or website requests the recipient to provide sensitive information,
      which may later be used to commit fraud.</p>
    <div> <a class="btp" href="#a5">Back to Top</a>
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>
    <a name="d4" id="d4"></a>
    <h3>How do I protect myself?</h3>
    <p>Consider whether the company would be likely to ask you for the kind of
      information being requested. If you are at all in doubt about the authenticity
      of the communication, contact the company through familiar communication
      channels (e.g., the phone number provided on account statement).</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Do not click on a link in an email when you are not sure of its legitimacy,
        even if it looks genuine. If you are at all in doubt, contact the company
        directly.</li>
      <li>Avoid emailing personal and financial information.</li>
      <li>Never open email attachments from unknown sources.</li>
      <li>If you receive an email that you believe could be fraudulent, immediately
        forward it to <a href="mailto:anti.fraud@ampf.com">anti.fraud@ampf.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Regularly review your account statements.</li>
      <li>Do not share IDs/user names and passwords.</li>
      <li>Change your passwords regularly.</li>
      <li>Be aware that other Internet companies that you do business with may
        be phished. If you pay an online service and/or have your credit card
        on file with an Internet based company, be cautious of emails from such
        companies that request you validate your credit card or checking account
        numbers.</li>
      <li>Install the latest anti-virus and firewall applications to your computer.</li>
      <li>Follow your computer manufacturer's recommendations to ensure that
        your computer is current on its patches. Refer to your computer's documentation
        or user's manual for further information.</li>
      <li>If you feel your Ameriprise Financial account information has been
        compromised, please contact Ameriprise Financial immediately.</li>
