<a name="whygather"></a><strong>Why does TD AMERITRADE gather information?<br>
</strong>There are several very important purposes. When you open an account, we gather information necessary to communicate with you about your account, to process transactions for you and to comply with federal and state laws, including tax laws and anti-money laundering laws. We also collect information to help us safeguard your assets. We continually strive to improve our services and provide you opportunities to use additional products and services you may find of interest. To do this, we gather information to help us assess your needs and preferences. This includes conducting surveys that ask you to provide demographic information and other means to aid us in anticipating your needs and satisfying your requests.<br>
<br>

<a name="whatinfo"></a><strong>What information does TD AMERITRADE collect?</strong><br>
The information we collect directly from you includes information required to communicate with you, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address and fax number; and to identify who you are, including Social Security number; and employer name and address.<br>
<br>
As required by law, to assess your experience in margin use and trading, we may also collect your approximate annual income, approximate net worth, and approximate worth, to assess your financial position.<br>
<br>
We also collect demographic information when you register through the site or request information on our products, including gender, birth date, education, occupation.<br>
<br>
The information we collect indirectly from you includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, Internet Service Provider (ISP), time stamps, transactions placed, products or services used, prior and following Web site you view, and banner ads you click. We do this through the use of cookies, which are small text files sent from the Web server to your computer. Cookies help us to know you better by providing operational data we can use to aid your interaction with our Web site and improve its security, navigation and usability.<br>
<br>

<a name="wheninfo"></a><strong>When does TD AMERITRADE obtain information?</strong><br>
You directly provide to us the majority of information we collect. You do this by completing the account application and related documentation, placing a trade, sending us an e-mail for questions or comment, or submitting information in response to a promotion or special offer. Other ways we obtain information are by (1) observing your usage of the Web site, (2) providing products and services to you, and (3) through other sources such as credit agencies, affiliates and business partners. This information enables us to offer you products and services that should be of interest to you.<br>
<br>

<a name="howpersonalinfo"></a><strong>How does TD AMERITRADE use your personal information?</strong><br>
Again, the trust of our clients is our most valued asset. Therefore, we use personal information only as appropriate to provide you quality service and security.<br>
<br>
For example, TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE may use the information collected from you to verify your identity and contact information. We may also use this information to establish and set up your trading account, issue an account number and a secure password, maintain your portfolio and trading activity, and contact you with account information. The collected information helps us improve our services to you, customize your browsing experience and inform you about additional products, services or promotions that may be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE may also use demographic information on our clients provided by others, so that we can develop products and services for our clients.<br>
<br>
Should you close your account with us, TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE will retain your information as needed to comply with regulatory requirements.<br>
<br>

<a name="affiliatehare"></a><strong>What information does TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE share with affiliated companies?</strong><br>
TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE will share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide a product or service you have requested. Additionally, TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE may share information with our affiliates about our experiences or transactions with you or your account in order to make you aware of services and products from which you may benefit.<br>
<br>
An affiliate is a company that we own or control or with which there is common ownership with us and our parent company. Each of the TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE companies, including TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE, Inc., Amerivest Investment Management, LLC and Ameritrade Advisory Services, LLC are affiliates of each other.  Additionally, companies in the TD Bank Financial Group family, including TD Bank and The Toronto-Dominion Bank and their subsidiaries, are affiliates of TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE.<br>
<br>
You may limit our affiliates in marketing their products or services to you based on personal information that we collect about you and share with them. This information may include your name, email address, mailing address, age, employment status, general account and demographic information and account history with us.  Your choice to limit marketing offers from our affiliates will apply until you tell us to change your choice.  You can opt back in at any time.<br>
<br>
To limit affiliate marketing offers:
<ul>
  <li>Contact us by phone at 800-669-3900</li>
  <li>Change your preferences on the Affiliate Marketing Opt-Out page
  </li><li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:optout@tdameritrade.com">optout@tdameritrade.com</a> with the words "opt-out" in the subject line and your TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE account number in the body copy.</li>
<br>
<br>
An opt-out election made by one account owner of a Joint account is applicable to all account owners of the Joint account. An opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE.<br>
<br>
</ul>

<a name="thirdparties"></a><strong>Does TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE share the information collected with any other third parties?</strong><br>
The cornerstone of our Privacy Statement is the commitment to keep our clients' personal information confidential. TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third party for purposes of marketing by the third party, or for any reason, except as described below:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to administer or process a transaction, product or service you have authorized or requested or in connection with settling a transaction. For example, we may be required to deliver personal information about you to third parties for certain investments, and to perform electronic funds transfers and wires.</li>
<li>We may disclose personal information about you to third parties or to government entities as required by law or regulation or in response to subpoenas, to credit bureaus and collection agencies, or when necessary to protect your rights or property or that of TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE.</li>
<li>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain internal functions such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with client information from our database to help us to analyze and identify client needs and notify clients of product and service offerings. Use of the information shared is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request and for no other purpose.</li>
<li>If you decide to participate in certain promotions and special offers, the promotion may require us to gather and share your personal information or may require you to supply personal information to the promotion sponsor, which may be a third party. For example, a referral program may require that we provide your name as a reference to a prospective client. It is always your choice whether or not to participate. If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, any personal information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>All third parties with which we share personal information are required to protect personal information in a manner similar to the way we protect personal information.<br>
<br>
If we propose to share information in a manner not covered in this Privacy Statement, we will notify you of this change by posting an addendum on the Web site, a notice in the "Announcements" or "What's New" section of the Web site, and if appropriate, provide you an opportunity to opt-out of such use.<br>
<br>

<a name="optoutpersonal"></a><strong>Can I opt-out of sharing my personal information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes?</strong><br>
Because we do not share information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes without your prior permission, there is no need to opt-out.<br>
<br>

<a name="optoutcertian"></a><strong>Can I opt-out of receiving certain information?</strong><br>
Yes.  You can control your communications preferences on the Communications Preferences Page for your account.<br>
<br>
If you want to opt-out of receiving all direct marketing communication from TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@tdameritrade.com">unsubscribe@tdameritrade.com</a> with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line and your TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE account number in the body copy.  In doing so, you will be identified as a client who does not care to be contacted by us through direct communication for additional product and services offerings or inquiries.  An opt-out election made by one account owner of a Joint account is applicable to all account owners of the Joint account. An opt-out election must be made for each separate account you hold at TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE.  This opt-out will not apply to communications required to service your account.
<br>
<br>

<a name="privacystatement"></a><strong>Does TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE's Privacy Statement apply to the sites to which we link?</strong><br>
No. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of sites we link to and have no control of the use or protection of information provided by you or collected by those sites. Whenever you elect to link to a co-branded Web site or to a linked Web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party, and you should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy provided by that third party.<br>
<br>

<a name="protectclients"></a><b>What steps does TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE take to protect our clients' personal information?</b><br>
We have made a significant investment in leading-edge security software, systems, and procedures to offer you a safe and secure trading environment and protect your personal, financial and trading information. While no security system is absolutely impenetrable, we are constantly reviewing, refining and upgrading our security technology, as new tools become available.<br>
<br>
When you open an account with us, you are issued a unique account number and a personal identification number (PIN). Upon logon, you may also be asked to create a UserID and password to access the Web site. Only a limited number of TD&nbsp;AMERITRADE employees who have a need to know this information will have access to your account number, PIN, UserID, and password. Remember: you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account number, PIN, UserID, and password. We strongly recommend that you do not disclose this information.<br>
<br>
