                    <li>Application Information. We retain personal information

                      accounts, EFT service, credit cards, consumer and real estate

                      social security number, and credit history. </li>
                    <li>Your Transactions. Any time you make a transaction on 
                      one of your accounts, including ATM or card transactions, 
                      loan advances, transactions through home banking, over the 
                      phone, or at a branch, we retain the transaction information. 
                      This includes: your account number, the date, amount, and 
                      location of the transaction. </li>
                    <li>Credit Reports. When we evaluate your application for 
                      an account or service, we may request a credit report about 
                      you from a consumer reporting agency. We retain the personal 
                      and credit history information about you, and we use it 
                      to evaluate future account service requests. </li>

                      to your information in order to provide service to you. 
                      However, our employees' access is restricted to their need 
                      to know such information or as necessary to conduct a transaction 
                      or respond to your inquiries. All employees are trained 
                      to respect member privacy. No one except our employees has

                      The application information we accept online and through 
                      our home banking service relies on industry standard "Secure 
                      Sockets Layer" (SSL) encryption to service your transaction 
                      information and communication. Generally, our e-mails are 
                      not secure. However, if we ask you to e-mail us information 
                      other than your name, address, e-mail address, and phone 
                      number, it will be obtained using a secure (SSL encryption)

                  <h1>Web Access Security</h1>
                  <h4>What kind of security is being used for Web Access Home 
                    Banking? </h4>
                  <p>America First Credit Union uses the latest technology to 
                    protect your account information from exposure to unauthorized 
                    persons. Below are some of the components of this security 
                    system:</p>
                  <p> 
                  </p><ul>
                    <li>An account number and PIN are required to access the system. 
                    </li>
                    <li>128-bit encryption scrambles your transmissions when crossing 
                      the Internet. </li>
                    <li>After entering a PIN incorrectly three times, access to 
                      an account is blocked. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>VeriSign, the recognized leader in Internet security, allows 
                    you to<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="MM_openWindow('https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/31fcb167c89f1f0b49c0d7b57943451f','verisign',

                    see the security features</a> of the Web Access home banking 
                    program before you use it.</p>
                  <p>Your are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your PIN 
                    in accordance with the terms contained in your Membership 
                    Account Agreement. We recommend you not store secured pages 
                    in your cache or leave your computer unattended while you 
                    are logged into Web Access. </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h4>What is encryption?</h4>
                  <p>Encryption takes meaningful text and numbers and scrambles 
                    them into numerical nonsense before transmitting them across 
                    the Internet. Your account information becomes "all mixed 
                    up and nonsense" when encryption is in place. For example, 
                    "pay $40 from checking to loan #1" could become something 
                    like "752144835628174317312". </p>
                  <p>The encryption process occurs for information going both 
                    directions - from your computer to the credit union and vice 
                    versa. Encryption uses complex algorithmic formulas to create 
                    a key that is used to translate the nonsense back to "pay 
                    $40 from checking to loan #1". There are billions of potential 
                    keys, and a different key is used for each Web Access session. 
                    Your computer and America First's computer establish this 
                    key when they make your Web Access connection. </p>
                  <p>Because there are billions of potential keys, it would take 
                    a thief several lifetimes to come up with the exact key a 
                    specific transmission uses. Netscape estimates the basic level 
                    of encryption (40-bit or international) would take a 64-MIPS 
                    computer a year of dedicated processor time to break. Domestic, 
                    or 128-bit, encryption is exponentially more difficult to 
                    break. Web Access supports only 128-bit encryption to give 
                    you Internet services with your security in mind.</p>
                  <h4>Why does Web Access set cookies?</h4>
                  <p>Why does Web Access set cookies? In order to better serve 
                    you and protect your account information, we use "cookies," 
                    nuggets of data that are stored on your hard drive as a file. 
                    We use cookies to verify who you are while using Web Access 
                    home banking. Cookies make it easier, quicker, and more secure 
                    for you to log into and use Web Access.</p>
                  <p>Cookies do not compromise privacy. Their data is usually 
                    stored on your computer's hard drive as a file or folder called 
                    "cookies," and you can delete this file anytime if you choose. 
                    The cookies in Web Access are only valid for the current session 
                    and shortly become invalid. Finally, cookies created by one 
                    site will only work with that specific site. Site A, for example,
