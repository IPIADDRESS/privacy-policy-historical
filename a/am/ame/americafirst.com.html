        your account and services as the law allows or requires us to collect. 
        We may collect personal information about you which is nonpublic. The 
        nonpublic personal information we collect varies depending on the accounts 
        and services you request and use. We collect information about you from 
        the following sources:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Application Information. </strong>We retain personal information 
          we receive from you on any application you provide for a deposit account, 
          EFT service, credit cards, consumer and real estate loans. Application 
          information includes: your name, address, Social Security number and 
          credit history.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Transactions.</strong> Any time you make a transaction 
          on one of your accounts, including ATM or card transactions, loan advances, 
          transaction through home banking, over the phone or at a branch, we 
          retain the transaction information. This includes your account number, 
          the date, amount, and location of the transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Reports.</strong> When we evaluate your application 
          for an account or service, we may request a credit report about you 
          from a consumer reporting agency. We retain the personal and credit

          home banking transaction, or information you send to us by email.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>2. Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards. </strong>We maintain 
        strict policies and security controls to assure that your nonpublic personal 
        information in our computer systems and files is protected.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Employee Access. </strong>Credit Union employees do have access 
          to your information in order to provide service to you. However, our 
          employeesâ€™ access is restricted to their need to know such information, 
          or as necessary to conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries.

        <li><strong>Security Safeguards. </strong>The Credit Union has established 
          security controls and procedures to safeguard the information you provide 
          us and the information we collect about you. The application information 
          we accept online and our home banking service relies on industry standard 
          Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to service your transaction information 
          and communication. Generally, our emails are not secure. However, if 
          we ask you to e-mail us information other than your name, address, email 
          address and phone number, it will be obtained using a secure (SSL encryption) 
          email form.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>3. Our Sharing of Member Information. </strong>In order to provide 
        financial services to you, we share certain information about you with 
        our affiliates and third-party service providers. However, we limit any 
        information sharing to the extent necessary to service your account. If 
        we share your information, it is with the goal of bringing you quality 
        services, more choices, and greater convenience. Information we may have 
        about former members is generally only shared or disclosed if required 
        to enforce or administer an account or as required by law.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li> <strong>Sharing Information with Credit Union Affiliates. </strong>Our 
          wholly owned subsidiary, America First Investment &amp; Insurance Services, 
          provides financial services, including alternative investment and insurance 
          products. We may share the following information with our affiliate 
          so they can serve you more efficiently:</li>
        <p><strong>.</strong> Member information (name, address, account number); 
          and</p>
        <p><strong>.</strong> Account information (type of accounts, account balances, 
          transaction history).</p>
        <p>Because we maintain management control over our affiliate(s), you can 
          expect our affiliate(s) maintain the same privacy standards as the Credit 
          Union.</p>
        <li><strong>Sharing Information with Third-Party Service Providers. </strong>In 
          order for us to conduct our operations, including servicing your account

          check, ATM and other payment processing companies, payment networks,

          agreements. These service providers act on our behalf and have agreed 
          in writing to keep the information we provide to them confidential. 
          We share the following categories of information with third-party service 
          providers, depending on the specific services provided:</li>

          balances, transaction history); and</p>
        <p><strong>	. </strong>Transaction information (dates, amounts, locations 
          and type of transactions).</p>
      </ol>

        account numbers, with nonaffiliated third-party marketers offering their 
        products and services. While we may offer financial products and services 
        of our affiliate(s) or third parties, we control the member information 
        used to make such offers.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>c. Sharing Information as Legally Required or Permitted. </strong>We 
        may share any nonpublic personal information of yours in response to a

        Act, which affords you the right to make sure that your credit bureau 
        reports are accurate.</p>
    <h1>Web Access Security</h1>
      <h4>What kind of security is being used for Web Access Home Banking? </h4>
      <p>America First Credit Union uses the latest technology to protect your 
        account information from exposure to unauthorized persons. Below are some 
        of the components of this security system:</p>
      <p> 
      </p><ul>
        <li>An account number and PIN are required to access the system. </li>
        <li>128-bit encryption scrambles your transmissions when crossing the 
          Internet. </li>
        <li>After entering a PIN incorrectly three times, access to an account 
          is blocked. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>VeriSign, the recognized leader in Internet security, allows you to <a href="javascript:PopUp_Outgoing('https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/31fcb167c89f1f0b49c0d7b57943451f')"> 
        see the security features</a> of the Web Access home banking program before 
        you use it.</p>
      <p>Your are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your PIN in accordance 
        with the terms contained in your Membership Account Agreement. We recommend 
        you not store secured pages in your cache or leave your computer unattended 
        while you are logged into Web Access. </p>
      <h4>What is encryption?</h4>
      <p>Encryption takes meaningful text and numbers and scrambles them into 
        numerical nonsense before transmitting them across the Internet. Your 
        account information becomes "all mixed up and nonsense" when encryption 
        is in place. For example, "pay $40 from checking to loan #1" could become 
        something like "752144835628174317312". </p>
      <p>The encryption process occurs for information going both directions - 
        from your computer to the credit union and vice versa. Encryption uses 
        complex algorithmic formulas to create a key that is used to translate 
        the nonsense back to "pay $40 from checking to loan #1". There are billions 
        of potential keys, and a different key is used for each Web Access session. 
        Your computer and America First's computer establish this key when they 
        make your Web Access connection. </p>
      <p>Because there are billions of potential keys, it would take a thief several 
        lifetimes to come up with the exact key a specific transmission uses. 
        Netscape estimates the basic level of encryption (40-bit or international) 
        would take a 64-MIPS computer a year of dedicated processor time to break. 
        Domestic, or 128-bit, encryption is exponentially more difficult to break. 
        Web Access supports only 128-bit encryption to give you Internet services 
        with your security in mind.</p>
      <h4>Why does Web Access set cookies?</h4>
      <p>Why does Web Access set cookies? In order to better serve you and protect 
        your account information, we use "cookies," nuggets of data that are stored 
        on your hard drive as a file. We use cookies to verify who you are while 
        using Web Access home banking. Cookies make it easier, quicker, and more 
        secure for you to log into and use Web Access.</p>
      <p>Cookies do not compromise privacy. Their data is usually stored on your 
        computer's hard drive as a file or folder called "cookies," and you can 
        delete this file anytime if you choose. The cookies in Web Access are 
        only valid for the current session and shortly become invalid. Finally, 
        cookies created by one site will only work with that specific site. Site 
        A, for example, cannot read cookies generated by Site B and then use that 
        information for purposes for which it was not intended. America First's 
        express policy is to use cookies only for your account security while 
        using Web Access. </p>
