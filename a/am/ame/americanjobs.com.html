		<h4>Information About All AmericanJobs.com Visitors</h4>
		<p>We gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We use such information in the aggregate and not on an individual basis.

		<h4>General Information Disclosure</h4>
		<p>We do not disclose information about your individual visits to AmericanJobs.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it, if it is needed to fulfill a product purchase, special offer request, contest entry etc., or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. But, we may record and share aggregated information with our partners. In addition, if we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of all or a material part of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your personal information to the party or parties involved as part of that transaction.</p>
		<h4>Privacy Commitment Changes</h4>
		<p>If we decide to change our privacy commitment for AmericanJobs.com, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
