			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>We at America's Test Kitchen (and related brands including Cook's Illustrated and Cook's Country) are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize the need for appropriate protection of personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified, including name, address, e-mail address, or credit card information).
