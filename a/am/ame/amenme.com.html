        <h3>Our Third-Party Ads May Use Visit Information From Your Browser</h3>
                <br>
        
        <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. 
        These companies may use information (<b>not including</b> your name, address, email address, or 
        telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements 
        about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this 
        practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,

        <h3>Password Protection</h3>
                <br>
        <p>When you provide Amen Me! your password, you can rest assured that it is safe.  As soon
        as you send it to us it is immediately scrambled.  It is stored in the scrambled state so that
        even our administrators cannot read it.  For this reason, we cannot send your password to you
        when you forget it.  Instead, we can send you a password we generate which we scramble and
        forget.  You can also log on using that new password and immediately change it to something
        else that we didn't generate.</p>
        <p>Each password gets scrambled using an irreversible scramble.  When you log in, the password
        you log in with is also scrambled before it is compared the one we have on our database.</p>
        <p>We have also taken precautions to make sure that if the database is ever stolen, that 
        common passwords couldn't be matched as well.</p>
        <p>When you come to Amen Me! we want you to rest assured that you can enjoy it without
        worrying about your security.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Email Addresses</h3>
                <br>
        <p>If we collect it, your email address is never shared with anyone for any reason.  We may occasionally send you
        notifications that we believe are important regarding the service itself.  We do not send you 
        anything else unless you specifically request to have it sent to you by signing up for it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Usage Information</h3>
                <br>
        <p>We do keep and analyze usage information in order to provide you with the most optimal service
        we can.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                <br>
        <p>We don't keep any personal information other than your email address and your scrambled
        password. </p>
