                                  privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of 
                             our operations, we gather certain types of information about 
                             our users. This 
                                  Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information that 
                             we may collect.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>
                             Information Collected</b><br>
                                       We collect two types of information about users: personal information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as 
                                       information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Personal Information</b><br>
                                       Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register for membership services 
                             or sign up as authors. These services include receiving electronic newsletters, creating personal stock 
                                       portfolios, using community and communication services, answering surveys, purchasing items, and entering contests and other promotional opportunities provided on our 
                                       sites. We may collect personal information from you in other areas of our sites, but we will provide on-screen notification that we are doing so. We may receive personal 
                                       usage and demographic information from our third-party partners, and we also collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request technical or other 
                                       help. This information enables us to improve our sites to make your online visits more productive and enjoyable.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Aggregate Information</b><br>
                                       One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information 
                                       volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned 
                                       to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page 
                                       from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our sites record IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and 
                                       to provide aggregate data to advertisers about the volume of use on our sites. We also create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers 
                                       and partners. This allows these parties to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are most relevant to your personal interests. An 
                                       advertiser will not know that you clicked its advertisement unless you voluntarily and explicitly permit us to provide such information.</font><br><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Search Terms</b><br>
                                       As a measure of user interest, we track search terms that are entered into our sites' search features. Search data and user-provided information help to improve the 
                                       relevancy of search results by learning user preferences and prioritizing search results accordingly. The intended result is a more efficient search feature for visitors 
                                       to our sites.</font><br> </p><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Use of Cookies</b><br>

                                       We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. At various 
                                       places on our sites, we ask whether users are under the age of 18 or 13. 
                             We rely on our users to be truthful in responding to these questions.</font><br>

                                       We request that children under the age of 18 not submit or post information to our sites. If an individual between the ages of 13 and 17 does so, 
                                       we may collect information (including personally identifying information). This information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by 
                             Ultio LLC or one of our affiliated sites and may, with the user's permission, be shared with pre-screened third parties. If a user or his/her parent or guardian changes his/her mind with 
                                       respect to such use, that user, parent or guardian may stop that use either by e-mail request or by modifying his/her registration information online.</font><br> </p><p>
