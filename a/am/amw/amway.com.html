		  STATEMENT</p>
		<p>Thank you for visiting www.amway.com (our "Site"). Amway 
		  appreciates the opportunity to interact with you on the Internet and 
		  is committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose 
		  of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information 
		  we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that 
		  information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have 
		  regarding our use of, and your ability to correct that information. 
		</p>
		<p class="menuhead">What Information We Collect and How We Use It</p>
		
		<hr>
		<p>Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following 
		  two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information. 
		</p>
		<p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that 
		  lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our 
		  Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable 
		  Information. You may however, voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable 
		  Information (such as name, e-mail address, and country of origin) for 
		  us to contact you, including via e-mail, to respond to your comments 
		  or inquiries. In such event, we might maintain a record or your contact, 
		  including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific 
		  to you. We use this information to provide better service in the event 
		  you contact us again.</p>
		<p>Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself 
		  identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include 
		  the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or the Web site that 
		  referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address 
		  (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf 
		  the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms 
		  that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information 
		  in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its 
		  effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make 
		  your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.</p>
		<p>We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise 
		  disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that, such information 
		  does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally 
		  Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect 
		  on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it 
		  will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information 
		  under this Privacy Statement.</p>
		<p class="menuhead"> Sharing Your Information</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, trade, 
		  rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally Identifiable Information 
		  we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable 
		  Information you provide to us will be stored in the Amway databases 
		  in the United States.</p>
		<p>We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online 
		  with other Amway-related entities and/or business partners that provide 
		  services to Amway. Where we engage third-party agents or contractors 
		  to perform services on our Site, we will require them to observe the 
		  intent of this Privacy Statement.</p>
		<p>From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable 
		  Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. 
		  We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any 
		  activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release 
		  Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release 
		  is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect 
		  the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.</p>
		<p>Amway or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another 
		  business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired. Should 
		  such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would 
		  share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies 
		  serving you and other users of our Site.</p>
		<p class="menuhead"> Your Choices</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the 
		  Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated 
		  to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those 
		  described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any 
		  such unrelated uses.</p>
		<p class="menuhead">Accessing and Correcting Your Information</p>
		<hr>
		<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable 
		  Information we collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, and 
		  reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct 
		  Personally Identifiable Information you have provided us, you may contact 
		  us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below.</p>
		<p class="menuhead">Protecting Your Information</p>
		<hr>
		<p>We acknowledge your trust and are committed to take reasonable steps 
		  to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide online from 
		  loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, 
		  and managerial processes to safeguard and secure your information. </p>
		<p class="menuhead">Use of Cookies On This Site</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's 
		  hard drive that allows a Web site to respond to you as an individual, 
		  gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order 
		  to tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Overall, 
		  cookies are safe, as they only identify your computer to customize your 
		  Web experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide access to your computer 
		  or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the 
		  information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor 
		  can they be used to deliver a virus.</p>
		<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust
		  yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify 
		  you of cookie placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or decline 
		  cookies completely.</p>
		<p>
		  Our Site does not send any cookies to your computer's hard drive.</p>
		<p class="menuhead"> Use of Active-X and Java Applets On This Site </p>
		<hr>
		<p>Active-X programs and Java Applets are executable programs transferred 
		  to your computer's hard drive that cause your computer to perform functions 
		  in connection with your visit to a Web site.</p>
		<p>
		  Our Site does not use Active-X programs or Java Applets.</p>
		<p class="menuhead">Use of Third-Party Media and Research Companies</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Our Site does not run third-party ads, nor do we use third-party media 
		  and research companies to place ads for us on other parties' Web sites.</p>
		<p class="menuhead"> Links To Other Web Sites</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Links to third-party Web sites may be provided solely for your information 
		  and convenience. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. This 
		  Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those 
		  Web sites linked to our Site, nor do we control their content or privacy 
		  policies. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies 
		  of each site you visit.</p>
		<p class="menuhead">Children's Privacy Protection</p>
		<hr>
		<p>We take special care to protect the privacy needs of children under 
		  the age of 13 and encourage parents to be an active participant in their 
		  child's online activities. We abide by the requirements of the Children's 
		  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant laws. Our Site 
		  does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13, 
		  and we will not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information 
		  from them. If we discover personal data from a child through an adult-oriented 
		  site, we will eliminate that data.</p>
		<p class="menuhead">Changes To This Statement</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Any updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy Statement will 
		  be posted here on our Site and the date of the newest version posted 
		  below. Please check back frequently, especially before you submit any 
		  Personally Identifiable Information at our Site, to see if this Privacy 
		  Statement has changed.</p>
		<p>
		  By using our Site, you acknowledge acceptance of this Privacy Statement 
		  in effect at that time of use.</p>
