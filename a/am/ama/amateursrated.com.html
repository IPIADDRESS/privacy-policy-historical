</p>
<h2>
The Registration Process
</h2>
<p>
The information harvested during the registration process is used to create your own unique identification as a site visitor/services user and enable us to undertake the various administration processes necessary.
</p>
<h2>
Your Unique Identification
</h2>

This identification is provided in the form of a member name and password. It is important that you keep this identification secret to avoid unauthorized use of your account.

</p>

<h2>
