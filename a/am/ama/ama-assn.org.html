<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<!-- category body -->
<!--startindex-->
<div id="maincontent"><p>The American Medical Association (AMA) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it at all times. This online privacy statement explains how the AMA collects, uses and safeguards information on its website. This Internet Privacy Statement applies <strong>only</strong> to information collected by the AMA through its website.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Internet Privacy Statement</strong></p>
<p>As our organization, membership and benefits change from time to time, this Internet Privacy Statement is expected to change as well. We reserve the right to amend the Internet Privacy Statement at any time, for any reason. We will post a notice that this Internet Privacy Statement has been amended by revising the "Last updated" date at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this Internet Privacy Statement, please&nbsp;send us an e-mail. Please note that we cannot process opt-out requests sent to this e-mail address.</p>
<p><strong>What information we collect and how we use it </strong></p>
<p><strong>Information we collect --</strong> When you browse www.ama-assn.org and do not interact with the site for any online service or product from the AMA, you browse anonymously. Personally identifiable information--such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address--is not collected as you browse.</p>
<p>When you become a registered user on our site, or choose to interact with our site in other ways, such as subscribing to AMA publications, purchasing an AMA product, applying for AMA membership, participating in online surveys, submitting questions or comments or requesting information or materials, we will collect certain personal information from you. The type of personal information collected will vary but may include name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery information, e-mail address, credit card information and other demographic information. We do not collect Social Security numbers via an AMA website. The type of product or service that you seek will determine the personal information that is collected. For a listing of the exact type of personal information that will be collected from you, please refer to the appropriate online form.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking activity on our website</strong> We track how our site is used by both anonymous visitors and visitors who interact with the site. One way we track is by using "cookies." A <em>cookie</em> is a small file or string of text on the site user's computer that is used to aid Web navigation. Two types of cookies are commonly used. A <em>session cookie</em> is created by a website when that website is accessed; that type of cookie is automatically deleted by closing the Web browser. A <em>persistent cookie</em> is a cookie that is stored on the hard drive of the user’s computer for a period of time chosen by the website that set the cookie, usually for a number of years, unless the user deletes it manually. This policy distinguishes between <em>short-lived cookies</em> and <em>long-lasting cookies</em>. <em>Short-lived cookies</em> include all session cookies and those persistent cookies that are set to be stored for no more than one week. AMA-related websites may at times require users to accept short-lived cookies in order for the websites to function properly. <em>Long-lasting cookies</em> may be used on the site to track visitor practices to help determine which site features and services are most important and guide editorial direction. Other long-lasting cookies may make it possible for the user to access the site without requiring entry of a user name or password, allow the user to view different restricted areas of the site without reregistering, allow the user to personalize the site for future use and provide other features and benefits. Users who do not desire the functionality created by the long-lasting cookie can disable the long-lasting cookie function, either by indicating when asked that they do not wish to have a long-lasting cookie created or by disabling the long-lasting cookie function on their Web browser. Individuals can opt out of long-lasting cookie functions that permit tracking of personal information at any time.</p>
<p>Cookies are required for the Members-Only and e-commerce sections of the website. Cookies are essential for site administration and security. Another way we track site activity is by using transparent electronic images called "clear GIFs," "Web bugs," or "Web beacons" on this site’s Web pages. These images count the number of users who visit that page from specific banner ads outside www.ama-assn.org or through e-mail links. A similar image, sometimes called a "spotlight tag," is used on this site’s Web pages where transactions take place. The spotlight tag collects numeric information, such as the dollar amount of an online purchase, to help us understand usage of the site. We do not use any of these electronic images to collect personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>How we use personal information --</strong> Once collected, we may use your personal information (except for e-mail address, which is outlined below) for the following purposes:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Register you for programs and services you have requested</li>
<li>Process, fulfill and follow up on your orders or membership application</li>
<li>Answer your e-mails or on-line requests</li>
<li>Send information you request</li>
<li>Send and process surveys</li>
<li>Ensure the AMA site is relevant to your needs</li>
<li>Deliver AMA services such as newsletters, meetings or events</li>
<li>Notify you about new products/services special offers, upgrades and other related information from the AMA and other approved third parties</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How we use your e-mail address --</strong>The following defines how e-mail will be handled for physicians and medical students, AMA members and nonphysicians who have supplied their e-mail address to the AMA.<br></p>
<p><strong>Physicians and medical students:</strong> All physicians and medical students who have opted in are sent the weekly <em>AMA Wire</em> publication.</p>
<p><strong>Physicians, medical students, and nonphysicians:</strong> The AMA may also send "transactional or relational e-mail messages" to physicians, medical students, and nonphysicians with whom we already have a relationship.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell, trade, exchange or rent your e-mail address to vendors for them to market their products or services to you. When we hire vendors to deliver e-mails to you on our behalf, they are under agreement and limited from using your e-mail address for any other purpose.</p>
<p>When we send e-mail to you, we may be able to identify information about your e-mail address, such as whether you can view graphic-rich HTML e-mail. If your e-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML e-mail messages.</p>
<p>These e-mail messages may contain "clear GIFs" or "Web beacons" to measure the offer’s effectiveness so we know how to serve you better. We do not collect personally identifiable information through "clear GIFs" or "Web beacons."</p>
<p><strong>How to opt out of e-mail --</strong> To opt out of an e-mail list, go to our <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/subscribe-newsletters.shtml">AMA e-newsletter sign-up page</a> or click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any e-mail newsletter from the AMA. You can also call the AMA Unified Service Center at (800) 621-8335.</p>
<p><strong>With whom we may share information --</strong> The AMA may share personal information with our business partners in order to provide them an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. The AMA also occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, consulting services, data modeling, printing, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service. They are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>The AMA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (<em>a</em>) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the AMA; (<em>b</em>) protect and defend the rights or property of AMA; or (<em>c</em>) protect the personal safety of AMA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances. In addition to the disclosures identified above, if you are a physician or medical student, the personal information you provide through the AMA website may be incorporated into the AMA’s physician database commonly known as the Physician Masterfile. The AMA has licensed its Physician Masterfile to third parties for more than 50 years under strict guidelines. The names and addresses of physicians and medical students in the AMA Physician Masterfile are made available only for communications that are germane to the practice of medicine or of interest to physicians or medical students as consumers. Read further information about the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/physician-data-resources/physician-masterfile.shtml" target="_blank">Physician Masterfile</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Banner advertisements on our website --</strong> Online advertisements on the AMA’s website do not collect any personally identifiable information on individual visitors. The AMA does collect nonmedical aggregate data on visitors such as time of day and Web browser type. Such information may be shared with advertisers to determine their advertising effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Children under 13 --</strong> We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>Information security --</strong> The AMA implements security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to personal information to the AMA’s business partners who may need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p><strong>How we safeguard information</strong><br></p>
<p><strong>Site security features</strong><br> <strong>SSL technology and how you benefit from it --</strong> AMA realizes the importance of security, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of information sent to or from AMA over the Internet. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This is done any time you supply or access information in one of our secure online areas.</p>
<p>SSL technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and AMA systems can understand. The SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and AMA systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential.</p>
<p><strong>User ID and password --</strong> Many areas of the site require the use of a user ID and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information. This allows AMA to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
<p>When you have finished using a secure area of AMA’s website, make sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on every secure page. When you click on the "Log Out" link, you will be given the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password.</p>
<p><strong>No guarantee --</strong> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, AMA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services.</p>
<p><strong>Linking to other Internet sites</strong><br> You should be aware that other Internet sites that link to the AMA site or to an AMA e-mail may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of this Internet Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>How you can access and change information</strong><br> If you are a registered user of the AMA website, subscriber to AMA publications, purchaser of AMA products or an AMA member, you may review and update/correct your information by using your user name and password or by contacting the AMA Unified Service Center at (800) 621-8335.</p>
<p>Physicians and medical students may <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/go/oldcc">update or correct any information the AMA may have on file by going online</a> or may call (800) 621-8335. Updates or corrections to certain types of information (e.g. physician licensure, medical education or training, etc.) will require independent verification prior to effectuating any (permanent) change to our files.</p>
