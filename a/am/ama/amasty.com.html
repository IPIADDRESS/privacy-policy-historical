    <blockquote><p>Having looked at all solutions on Magento connect, this module far and away stood out from the crowd. We commissioned Amasty to make a modification for our specific needs, this was taken on with enthusiasm and above all, our brief was fully understood from the outset. Our modified extension now has the facility to include images - for our purposes this was very much needed! - I believe this will be released as a future update to the module.  
 
The customer service provided by Amasty has been nothing but exemplary. Support have answered all questions posed to them with speed and efficiency. Amasty have made our list as one of the best developers for Magento we have found and would most certainly deal with them again as well as recommend them to anyone looking at this module or any other they provide.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Been looking for something to do this for a month! This worked flawlessly with my post affiliate pro coupons so now I can import 1000s of coupons with little effort easily. We were worried this process would take weeks and this solved all of our problems. First extension I have used that didnt give me a headache of issues to get around as well. Seriously worth the money will look into their other extensions as well soon as they appear to be good and clean coders. I hate when I buy an extension that I pay for and have to fix or contact support about. This was nothing like that. Perfection and well priced. Only thing that could make it better is if it were free heh. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I am very very satisfied with this great module. Also i want to mention the terrific supportive persons behind Amasty - i had some problems with another extension which blocked a feature and help was very fast and very professional done.  
 
Thanks Amasty for your great help, we see us again for sure!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What would have taken me <a href="http://amasty.com/duplicate-categories.html">weeks to complete</a> took me under an hour. When it comes to Magento and future work I might need, Amasty will be the first company I look to! Thank you!</p></blockquote>
