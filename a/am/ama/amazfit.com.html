However, you should be aware that the use of the Internet is not entirely secure, and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information which is transferred from you or to you via the Internet.</p> <p>In order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure or other similar risks, we have put in place reasonable administrative, technical and physical controls and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from your using of HUAMI products and services and on HUAMI websites. We will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal information.</p> <p>For example, when you access your Mi Account, you can choose to use our two-step verification process for better security. When you send or receive data from your HUAMI device to our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") and other algorithms.</p> <p>All your personal information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We classify your data based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the highest security level. We make sure that our employees and Third Party Service Providers who access the information to help provide you with our products and services are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations. We have special access controls for cloud based data storage as well. All in all, we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.</p> <p>By using our products and services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use. If we learn of a security systemâs breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the website or through the product or service and/or by sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Â· You can play your part in safeguarding your personal information by not disclosing your login password or account information to anybody unless such person is duly authorized by you. Whenever you log in as a Mi Account user on HUAMI websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always log out at the end of your session.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Â· HUAMI cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Â· Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>OPT-OUT (RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING)</strong></p> <p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information. Where you have consented to HUAMIâs processing of your personal information or sensitive personal information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt-out to further processing by contacting HUAMI. In order to provide our services to you, we will ask you to provide personal information that is necessary to provide those services to you. If you do not provide your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services. Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-personal information regarding your activities on our websites and/or information from the advertisements on third party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p> <p><strong>Mobile devices</strong></p> <p>HUAMI may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications with version updatesand other notices that may be of interest to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by changing the settings on your mobile device. HUAMI may also collect location-based information if you use our mobile applications. You may opt-out of this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device.</p> <p><strong>âDo Not Trackâ</strong></p> <p>Do Not Track (âDNTâ) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.</p> <p><strong>Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p> <p>As noted herein, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p> <p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> and <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>To be clear, cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personal information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partnersâ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>ACCESSING OTHER FEATURES ON YOUR DEVICE</strong></p> <p>Our applications may need access to certain features on your device such as Wi-Fi network status.

Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Â· Although HUAMI makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which HUAMI is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise othersâ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individualâs privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If HUAMI determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, HUAMI will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</strong></p> <p>If you have previously provided us consent to use your personal information, you may withdraw your consent by submitting a request.

In particular, we will ensure that all transfers will be in accordance with requirements under your applicable local data protection laws by putting in place appropriate safeguards. You will have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards taken by HUAMI for this transfer of your personal information.</p> <p>HUAMI may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by HUAMI to process or back up your personal information. All personal information collected via or by HUAMI may be stored anywhere in the world. Currently, HUAMI has data centers in China, the United States, Singapore and Germany. These overseas jurisdictions may or may not have in place data protection laws which are substantially similar to that in your home jurisdiction. We may transfer to and store your personal information at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to HUAMI, you consent to the storage of your personal information in these locations.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>MINORS/CHILDRENâS PRIVACY</strong></p> <p>Our products and services are not directed to children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16) years of age.

If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16) and we do not obtain permission from a parent, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the minorâs account.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p> <p>We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices.
