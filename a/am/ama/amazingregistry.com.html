<p>With whom your information is shared and how it is used </p>
<p>When you provide information to AmazingRegistry.com or its partners as described above, some of the information is stored in our and some of our partners' databases. Such information is used by AmazingRegistry.com in accordance with this Privacy Policy and by our partners in accordance with their policies. Information we collect is used by us (i) to tailor your experience at our website, (ii) to show you content we think you might be interested in, (iii) to display content according to your preferences, (iv) to notify you of important functionality changes, new AmazingRegistry.com services and other noteworthy news items about us, our partners, and our vendors, (v) to send you information, special offers and other promotional materials about AmazingRegistry.com, our partners and our vendors, and/or (vi) if it becomes necessary to contact you.</p>
<p>In addition, to allow you to use some of our features and/or to fulfill your requests and/or orders (including online gift registry and online shopping), information we collect will also be shared with our partners and other third parties, such as product suppliers, airlines, car rental agencies, and travel agencies. Finally, we may also share your personal information with other providers of products and services, we think may be of interest to you. Although this Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices or policies of any such partners, vendors or third parties, we generally require all of our partners agree not to use your personal information, except as fully disclosed to you or authorized by you.</p>
<p>Any information we collect may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. In addition, we may from time to time hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market research surveys, contest entry processing, and other distribution, and we will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties will be protected by a confidentiality agreement that will obligate the third party to use such information solely to complete the specific project.</p>
<p>In addition to the circumstances described above, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authorities, or in the good faith belief disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable, including (without limitation) when we have reason to believe disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Information stored on our servers may also be transferred to a third party acquiring or merging with the company. However, any such third party shall be required to use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The choices you have about the collection and use of your information </p>

<p>The security measures we take to protect your personal information</p>
<p>When you register for certain online gift registries, you will have the opportunity (depending on which partner you are registering with) to select whether you wish to make your online registry private. If you do not elect to make your gift registry or other, anyone visiting our website will be able to search for your registry by using first and/or last names and wedding dates (and on some pages, city or state).</p>
