                            <strong>1. What is a cash advance or payday loan?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It’s a short term loan that helps give you some extra cash when you need it before
                            payday! The amount is usually between $100 and $999, however some lenders may go
                            above that.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>2. What will happen if the repayment of my loan is late?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Since your loan with us is automatically processed on the agreed upon due date (per
                            your loan agreement), you do not have to worry about missed or late payments. If
                            you find that your loan payment has been returned to us unpaid, you will be charged
                            a $15 return fee but no additional charges (i.e. late fees) will be applied. Customers
                            with returned payments are strongly encouraged to contact us as soon they become
                            aware of that our debit is being returned. If you find that you are unable to pay
                            your loan on the upcoming due date, please contact us to determine what options
                            may be available to you.
