sensibly. <b>By visiting www.amazonservices.com, you are accepting the

<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">What Personal Information About Users Does Amazon Services Gather?</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">The information we learn from users helps us personalize and
continually improve your experience at www.amazonservices.com. Here are the
types of information we gather. </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li><b><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">Information You Give Us:</span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana"> We receive and store any
     information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.

     choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able

     provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, </span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:windowtext">improving
     the site</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;

 <li><b><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">Automatic Information:</span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana"> We receive and store certain
     types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many
     Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of
     information when your Web browser accesses www.amazonservices.com. <a href="#example">Click
     here</a> to see examples of the information we receive. A number of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/501098/002-0524907-7464825">companies</a>

     we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at www.amazonservices.com
     if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools
     exist. </span></li>
 <li><b><span style="
     font-family:Verdana;">E-mail Communications:</span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana;"> To help us make
     e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when
     you open e-mail from Amazon Services if your computer supports such
     capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,
     please </span><a href="unsubscribe.html">click here</a>.</li>

<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">What About Cookies?</span></b><span style="
font-family:Verdana;"> </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer
     to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
     systems to recognize your browser and to provide various features. </span></li>
 <li><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will
     tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
     have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
     disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to use certain
     features on this site if you do not use cookies, and we recommend that you
     keep them turned on.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">Does Amazon Services Share the Information It Receives?</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">Information about our customers is an important part of our
business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer
information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries
it controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices
at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</span></p>

<ul>

<li><span style="font-family:Verdana"><b>Use
of Third Party Service Providers:</b></span><span style="
font-family:Verdana;"> We may, from time to time, employ other
companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
sending postal mail and e-mail. They have access to personal information needed
to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </span></li>

<li><span style="font-family:Verdana"><b>Promotional
Offers:</b></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;">
Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon Services customers on
behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your
name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, </span>
<a href="unsubscribe.html">please click here</a><span style="font-family:Verdana;">.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-family:Verdana"><b>Business
Transfers:</b></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;
"> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information
generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the
promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user
consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon Services, Inc., or
substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course
be one of the transferred assets. </span></li>

<li><span style="font-family:Verdana"><b>Protection
of Amazon Services and Others:</b></span><span style="
font-family:Verdana;"> We release personal information when we
believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our </span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:navy"><a href="terms.html"><span style="color:navy">Conditions of Use</span></a></span><span style="font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;"> and other agreements; or protect the
rights, property, or safety of Amazon Services, our users, or others. This
includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not
include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally
identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of
the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </span></li>

<li><span style="font-family:Verdana"><b>With
Your Consent:</b></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;
"> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an
opportunity to choose not to share the information. </span></li>

</ul>

<p><b><span style="font-family:Verdana;
">What Choices and Access Do I Have?</span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana;"> </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">As discussed above, you can always choose not to
     provide information, even though it might be needed to request information
     about Amazon Services or take advantage of a feature on this site.</span></li>
 <li><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail
     from us, please </span><a href="unsubscribe.html">click here</a><span style="
     font-family:Verdana">. (If you do not want to receive <a href="terms.html">Conditions
     of Use</a> and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice,
     those notices will still govern your use of www.amazonservices.com, and it
     is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</span></li>
