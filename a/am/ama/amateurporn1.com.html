•	<p>Processing means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means. </p>

<p>4. Purpose(s) of processing your personal data </p>

<p>A. Cookies</p>
<p>This website uses cookies. According to the GDPR parts of this information could be interpreted as (online) identifiers and therefore may qualify as personal data, especially when this data is combined.

<p></p><p>6. What we do with your personal data</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>The passively collected, aggregated information collected through cookies is being used for market research, marketing purposes, to optimize our services and to optimize your experience on our site. We also track clicks on items to improve our rankings and to analyze the traffic to and from our site. With cookies we can also personalize your experience by recognizing which language or orientation you chose as a filter and to show you the items you favorized. We consider this data anonymous, since this information does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. </p>
<p>Other personal data</p>
<p>Personal data you actively provided to us through your use of the site is handled to process your report, feedback or request. We do not provide third parties with your personal data, or information regarding your use of the services or site(s) accessible through our services, unless this is strictly necessary in our sole discretion, and we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including but not limited to: </p>
•	<p>To satisfy any laws, regulations or legal requests for such information; </p>
•	<p>To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or other policies; </p>
•	<p>To operate our services properly; </p>
•	<p>To process your request; </p>
•	<p>To protect our site’s visitors, the general public, and ourselves. We specifically reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process; </p>
•	<p>To cooperate with law enforcement authorities, government agencies and/or private-party litigants seeking information about our users, to the extent required by applicable law and/or if we are legally advised to do so. Examples of such cooperation include but are not limited to, lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process. </p>
<p>7. What are your rights regarding our processing of your personal data? </p>
<p>Access, rectification, restriction and erasure</p>
<p>You can always send us a message to ask what personal data is stored of you or ask us to rectify, restrict or remove your personal data. Since our storage of personal data is minimal, and almost all our data is anonymized and aggregated, we cannot gaurantee that we have your data on file. As explained before, when data is anonymized, it is not considered personal data. </p>
<p>If you sent us an e-mail, we can retrieve that e-mail if we still have it on our mailservers. If so, we cannot rectifiy any data in that e-mail, since e-mails cannot be changed. We can delete any e-mail on request. The same goes for messages you send us through other mediums. </p>
<p>Please note that we might have legitimate rights to continue processing your personal data, which override your interest, rights and freedoms regarding our processing of such data. For example, we might be obligated to continue processing your personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or we need to retain such data for other legal purposes. We will always inform you of this decision when you contact us with a request to exercise one of your rights stated in this section. </p>
<p>Data portability</p>
<p>The data we process is minimal, and mostly aggregated and anonymized. You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you in an interoperable format, so you can transmit that data to another service provider. We cannot guarantee that we have your personal data on file and/or in an interoparble format, but we will do our best to assist you in enforcing your right regarding data portability. </p>
<p>Withdrawing consent</p>
<p>As explained in our paragraph on cookies, you can withdraw consent by deleting your cookies. You can contact us with your request to withdraw consent for any personal data you provided to us via certain interactions with our site, such as using a specific website feature or sending (e-mail) messages. Please note that we may have a legal obligation to retain your personal data to comply with laws and regulations. </p>

<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. We suggest that you contact the compentent supervisory authority in the country of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement. </p>
