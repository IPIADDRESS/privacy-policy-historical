  <b>PART B</b></p>
<h2>COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>Browsing</h3>
<p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your 
  computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. This 
  means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally 
  identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or 
  any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from

  with other activities, such as subscribing to the services offered on the Website, 
  utilising online software applications or purchasing any of the products and 
  services available on the Website, AtomPark Software Inc. may ask you to voluntarily 
  supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting 
  an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities

  upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of 
  the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some 
  as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular 
  activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make 
  such a purchase.<br>

  conjunction with AtomPark Software Inc. services and products. In order to use 
  those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. 
  Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide

  providers often provide that they will share with AtomPark Software Inc. personal 
  information collected from you. In such instances, AtomPark Software Inc. may 
  use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br>

<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail 
  service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies 
  that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtomPark Software Inc. These 
  parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information 
  for any purpose other than for the purpose AtomPark Software Inc. specifies. 
  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers 
  for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual 
  obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information 
  to entities outside of the AtomPark Software Inc.'s affiliates for their use 
  without your approval.</p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. may disclose your personally identifiable information 
  if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply 
  with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AtomPark Software Inc. 
  may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to 
  believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or

  End User License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public 
  or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist 
  us in developing, operating and maintaining AtomPark Software Inc.'s products.</p>
<p>In the event that all or substantially all of AtomPark Software Inc.'s stock 
  and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AtomPark Software Inc.

  we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the 
  collection of this information.<br>
  You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtomPark Software 
  Inc. or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected 
  companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences
