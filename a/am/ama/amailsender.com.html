  the execution and delivery of the agreements between you and AtomPark Software 
  Inc. and/or the implementation of the product by you. Nothing contained in this 
  section shall be construed as an obligation by you to disclose any of your proprietary 
  or confidential information to any third party. In addition, you may opt-out 
  from this Section by writing an opt-out request to AtomPark Software Inc. at: 
  medik@atompark.com </p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail 
  service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and marketing companies 
  that act as independent contractors on behalf of AtomPark Software Inc. These 
  parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information 
  for any purpose other than for the purpose AtomPark Software Inc. specifies. 
  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers 
  for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual 
  obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information 
  to entities outside of the AtomPark Software Inc.'s affiliates for their use 
  without your approval.</p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. may disclose your personally identifiable information 
  if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply 
  with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AtomPark Software Inc. 
  may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to 
  believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or 
  bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Privacy Policy or 
  End User License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public 
  or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which assist 
  us in developing, operating and maintaining AtomPark Software Inc.'s products.</p>
<p>In the event that all or substantially all of AtomPark Software Inc.'s stock 
  and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AtomPark Software Inc. 
  may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, 
  as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information 
  will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent 
  with our policy regarding notification of changes.</p>
<h3>Choices Available to You </h3>
<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information 
  and that choice will not prevent you from using the AtomPark Software Inc. Website. 
  Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, 
  we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the 
  collection of this information.<br>
  You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtomPark Software 
  Inc. or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected 
  companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences 
  with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt 
  out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third 
  parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information 
  for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer 
  the Website or comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and 
  infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes 
  that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up 
  for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to 
  contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there 
  has been a violation of our End User License Agreement. </p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. is retaining these rights because in limited cases we 
  feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding 
  matters which will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact 
  you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and 
  issuance of these types of communications are rare. </p>
