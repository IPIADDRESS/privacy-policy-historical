        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p>Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. Personal information can include your name, address, telephone number (home and business), e-mail address, date of birth, place of employment, and the nature, frequency and type of AMA services used by you. The amount and nature of the personal information AMA may require will depend on the type of products or services you request. For certain information intensive offerings, such as insurance or financial services, additional appropriate personal information may be collected to provide you with the particular service or product you have requested. The choice to provide AMA with your personal information is always yours, but may affect the availability and quality of the products and services available.</p>
        <h2>Why AMA collects personal information</h2>
        <p>AMA is committed to providing an extensive and superior range of products and services to our members. AMA collects your personal information so that we may maintain your membership, provide you with the products and services you have requested and provide you with the other benefits of membership. Your personal information is used to understand your needs and preferences, determine whether AMA products and services meet your needs, and develop or improve products and services. AMA presently offers and informs you about AMA products and services, or those of AMA partners that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
        <h2>How your personal information is used</h2>
        <p>AMA uses your personal information to maintain your membership, to communicate with you, to deliver the services and products you have requested, to provide you with responsible and reliable value-added advice, to offer additional products and services AMA believes may be of benefit and interest to you and to advise you of other benefits of AMA membership.</p>
        <h2>Your personal information is used for proper purposes only</h2>
        <p>AMA will safeguard your personal information and use it only for the purposes that it was collected for as permitted by you or under applicable laws. AMA will not sell, rent or give away your personal information. AMA does contract with certain service providers approved by AMA, who may occasionally have access to your personal information. However, these providers are allowed access to member information only when necessary, and are bound by strict contractual obligations designed to protect the privacy and security of your personal information.</p>
        <h2>Employees</h2>
        <p>AMA employees are informed and educated on the importance of protecting the privacy of our members, and are expected to maintain the confidentiality of AMA member information at all times.</p>
        <h2>AMA’s commitment</h2>
        <p>AMA will protect your privacy, and in particular your personal information, in accordance with the 10 Principles of Privacy. These principles have been established by the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Accountability</strong><br>
            AMA is responsible for personal information under its control. AMA will designate one or more persons who are accountable for compliance with the 10 Principles of Privacy. </li>
            <li><strong>Identifying Purposes<br>
            </strong>AMA will identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected. </li>
            <li><strong>Consent<br>
            </strong>Consent is required for AMA’s collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where required or permitted by law. Consent can be implied, deemed or expressly given. </li>
            <li><strong>Limiting Collection</strong><br>
            Personal information collected will be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by AMA. </li>
            <li><strong>Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</strong><br>
            AMA will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which the information was collected, except with your consent or as required by law. AMA will retain personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting such information. </li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy<br>
            </strong>Personal information will be maintained by AMA in an accurate, complete and up-to-date form as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the personal information is to be used. </li>
            <li><strong>Safeguards</strong><br>
            AMA will protect personal information with security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. </li>
            <li><strong>Openness<br>
            </strong>AMA will make readily available its policies and practices relating to the management of personal information. </li>
            <li><strong>Customer Access</strong><br>
            Upon request AMA will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your personal information. We can also provide you access to your personal information, subject to any legal restrictions. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your personal information, and may request that the information be corrected or updated, if appropriate. </li>
            <li><strong>Challenging Compliance<br>
            </strong>You may direct any questions or inquiries concerning our compliance with AMA’s Privacy Policy to the Chief Privacy Officer. The contact information is listed at the bottom of this page. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Fees</h2>
        <p>AMA may charge, in accordance with applicable laws, a reasonable fee for access to personal information and for making copies of personal information requested.</p>
        <h2>Information collected to date</h2>
        <p>AMA is operating on the understanding that we have your consent to use and disclose your personal information collected to date, and to do so in accordance to our Privacy Policy. However, you may refuse or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and providing AMA with reasonable notice of the withdrawal of your consent. If you choose to withdraw consent or not provide certain personal information, your decision may limit the services and products AMA can offer and may make it more difficult for AMA to provide you with advice.</p>
