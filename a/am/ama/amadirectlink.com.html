<h1>The American Motorcyclist Association <br>
Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">This document was last updated on September 3, 2008</p>
<p>The American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) understands how valuable privacy 
is to our members and site visitors. This Privacy Policy explains how the AMA collects 
and uses personal information and how you can make your privacy preferences known.</p>
<h3><b>Which sites are covered by this privacy policy?</b></h3>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the following AMA sites:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AmericanMotorcyclist (including www.AmericanMotorcyclist.com, www.AMADirectlink.com, www.ama-cycle.org and home.ama-cycle.org)</li>
	<li>AMA Members Only</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What personal information do we collect? </b></h3>
<p><b>Accessing content on AmericanMotorcyclist<br>
</b>You can access our Web site’s homepage and browse all of our content, except 
that designated as “members-only,” without disclosing personal information. </p>
<p>We collect only non-personal information such as your computer’s IP address, 
your domain name, your operating system and your browser. This information is used 
to evaluate how you and other visitors use the AMA Web site and is not used to track 
your name, e-mail address or other personal data. </p>
<p><b>AMA Members Area content<br>
</b>To access members-only content, you must first be an AMA member. AMA members 
must provide their AMA number, ZIP code and e-mail address to create a username 
and password, which is then used to access content in the Members Area. </p>
<p><b>Personal information we collect<br>
</b>If you choose to join the AMA online, we will ask for personal information, including 
your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, birth date and riding 
preferences. This information is used for correspondence related to your membership 
and, if you instruct us to, may be used to contact you regarding certain other benefits 
or products of the AMA, AMA Pro Racing and the Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum, and 
AMA-endorsed programs. </p>
<p>We may also ask for personal information when you participate in other activities 
on the AMA Web site, including online shopping and our e-mail newsletter, 
AMA Extra. </p>
<!-- <p>Any information you provide when posting to the Backfire section of the site 
will become public and may also be used in the AMA&#8217;s magazine, American Motorcyclist.</p> -->
<p><b>Children’s privacy</b><br>
The AMA realizes that children may visit and use the AMA Web site. Therefore, 
we encourage parents, guardians and teachers to monitor children’s use of the Internet. 
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any personal 
information about themselves over the Internet, to us or anyone else.</p>
<p><b>Use of cookies</b><br>
We use cookies to recognize you and your access privileges for our members-only 
content, to record votes for our online polls and to track membership 
sales from our affiliates. We also use cookies to collect anonymous traffic data 
to evaluate how you and other visitors use the AMA Web site. We do not use cookies to collect 
personal information.</p>
<p>You can set your browser so that it will not accept cookies. Doing so, however, 
will prohibit you from accessing certain features of the Web site, including  
content in the Members Area. You can use your browser’s help feature to learn more about disabling cookies.</p>
<p><b>Third-party advertising<br>
</b>We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies 
such as DoubleClick.</p>
<p><b>Linked sites<br>
</b>The AMA is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of Web sites to 
which it may link.</p>
<p><b>Non-US customer information<br>
</b>The AMA’s Web sites are located in the United States and the AMA collects, stores 
and processes your personal information in the United States. The United States 
may not offer a level of privacy protection for your personal information as great 
as is offered in the country in which you live. </p>
<h3>How do we use your personal information?</h3>
<p>Our primary purpose in using personal information we collect is to provide service 
for your AMA membership and provide you with products and services you request, 
such as gift shop purchases, e-mail newsletters, and access to members-only content 
on our Web site.</p>
<p>On occasion, if you instruct us to, we may also use your membership information 
to send you information about special offers, benefits and services provided by 
the AMA and its affiliates. If you do not wish to receive this information, please 
let us know by calling us at (800) AMA-JOIN, e-mailing us at 
<a href="mailto:ama@ama-cycle.org">ama@ama-cycle.org</a> or 
writing to us at 13515 Yarmouth Dr., Pickerington, OH, 43147.</p>
<p>From time to time, if you instruct us to, we make our membership list available 
to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find 
interesting. If you do not want us to share your address with other companies or 
organizations, please let us know by calling us at (800) AMA-JOIN, e-mailing us 
at <a href="mailto:ama@ama-cycle.org">ama@ama-cycle.org</a> or writing to us at 13515 Yarmouth Dr., Pickerington, OH, 43147.</p>
<p><b>Opting out<br>
</b>You can tell us if you do not want to receive information and offers from the 
AMA and its affiliates, other organizations or both by calling us at (800) AMA-JOIN, 
e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:ama@ama-cycle.org">ama@ama-cycle.org</a> or writing to us at 13515 Yarmouth Dr., Pickerington, 
OH, 43147.</p>
<p><b>E-mail policy<br>
</b>The AMA does not send unsolicited e-mails. If you have elected to receive one 
of our e-mail newsletters and do not wish to continue receiving it, simply unsubscribe 
using the instructions provided in the e-mail.</p>
