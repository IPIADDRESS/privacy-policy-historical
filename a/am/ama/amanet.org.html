<p><strong>You may opt out of our sharing of your Personally  Identifiable Information with third parties for marketing purposes, by  following the directions in the Sharing Personally Identifiable Information  section below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use</strong><br>

<p>AMA will not sell, share, or rent Personally Identifiable  Information other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. AMA does not sell,  share with or rent to others e-mail addresses solely for the purpose of third  party marketing, other than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, but we may  include third party advertisements within e-mails that we may send to you.</p>
<p>Among other things, we may use your Personally  Identifiable Information to respond to your requests and inquiries; to provide  you with the services, products and features offered on or through the Website;  to customize our Website to your interests and history with us; to protect our  rights and property; and for other purposes disclosed when Personally  Identifiable Information is submitted to us. We may also use your Personally  Identifiable Information to tailor ads displayed to you on our Website and  elsewhere to your interests and history with us and to communicate timely  information and special offers (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings,  and the like) about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us  and others, that we think might interest you.<strong> You may choose not to receive our promotional e-mails and mailings  by e-mailing customerservice@amanet.org&nbsp;or by calling AMA Customer Service  at 1-877-566-9441.</strong>&nbsp;Please understand that if you choose not to  receive such promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in  connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications  with us.</p>
<p>If you register for a seminar or pay for products and  services using a credit card, Personally Identifiable Information (such as your  name and shipping address) and financial information (such as your credit card  number and expiration date) may be required. This information may be used for  billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order,  this contact information may be used to get in touch with you. Personally  Identifiable Information also may be collected when you apply for a position with  AMA or a  program sponsored by AMA.  In these cases, Personally Identifiable Information is used only for the  purpose of processing and evaluating the application.</p>
<p>The Personally Identifiable Information you give us via  the Website and information about your order may be combined with other  Personally Identifiable Information (such as demographic information and past  purchase history) and Website Usage Information available from our records and  other sources (including, without limitation, our worldwide databases and third  parties). This information may be used to make our future marketing efforts  more efficient and will help us to improve the operations and maintenance of  our Website and business.</p>
<p>Any or all of the above activities with regard to Personally  Identifiable Information may be performed by us or on our behalf by our service  providers or partners.</p>
<p><strong>When You Refer a Friend/Colleague</strong><br>
  AMA respects the privacy of your friends and coworkers.  AMA will not keep or maintain names or e-mail addresses when you use our  refer-a-friend function. The refer-a-friend function is solely to provide your  friends and coworkers with the information you have requested we pass along to  them.</p>
<p><strong>Webcasts, Online “Meetings” and Similar Services</strong><br>
  Users may be able to access or participate in Webcasts,  online “meetings” or similar services on the Website, certain of which may be  hosted or operated by our service provider, ON24 Incorporated (“On24”). In some  cases, users may be able to register for such Webcasts and services directly  with ON24, and any such Personally Identifiable Information collected by ON24 in  connection with such registration and such user’s participation in the services  thereafter may be shared with AMA, and will also be subject to ON24 privacy  policy, located at&nbsp;https://www.on24.com/about-us/privacy-policy. In other  cases, some users may be able to access Webcasts, online “meetings” or similar  services hosted by ON24 on the Website by registering with AMA, and in such  situations, any Personally Identifiable Information that may be disclosed  during participation in such services would be collected by ON24 on AMA’s  behalf but would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
  AMA may share Personally Identifiable Information  collected electronically through its Website in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AMA or AMA partners may use third parties to  provides services for AMA (or on its behalf), such as an outside shipping  company to ship orders, and/or a credit card processing company to bill for  goods and services purchased through the AMA Website, and AMA will share  Personally Identifiable Information with those entities.</li>
  <li>From time to time, AMA works with business  partners, service providers and sponsors to provide or offer specific products  and services, such as jointly developed and marketed products and services.  When you sign up for or utilize such products or services, we will share  Personally Identifiable Information necessary for the partner/sponsor to  provide these products or services to you.</li>
  <li>AMA does provide certain third parties with its  postal mailing address list (which includes names and postal addresses) on a  rental basis, and, in some cases, AMA may also provide third parties with  information about you and your order so that they can more easily identify and  communicate offers that may interest you.&nbsp;<strong>If you wish to be excluded  from such lists and from receiving third party mailings, or if you prefer that  we do not share your information with third parties for their own marketing  purposes, please e-mail&nbsp;customerservice@amanet.org&nbsp;or call AMA  Customer Service at&nbsp;1-877-566-9441. </strong>To stop receiving  promotional messages from third parties who already have your contact  information, please contact them directly.</li>
  <li>AMA may provide Personally Identifiable  Information obtained from non-U.S. individuals to its licensee located in the  country or region where the individual is located, and our licensee may use  this information to communicate with the user. <strong>If you prefer that we do not  provide your information to our licensee, please e-mail&nbsp;customerservice@amanet.org&nbsp;or  call AMA Customer Service at 1-877-566-9441.</strong></li>
  <li>E-mailings of AMA newsletters and other  materials, as well as various operations of the Website, are handled both  in-house and by outside service companies (such as e-mail service providers,  address list hosting companies, distribution companies, suppliers and other  service providers, such as Caspio, Inc.). On occasion, where AMA contracts with  a service provider for this purpose, it may request or it may be necessary that  the provider collect and/or provide information (including Personally  Identifiable Information) directly from our customers on our behalf. In all  such situations, AMA restricts how these suppliers and other service providers  may access, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information. AMA does not  permit these suppliers and other service providers to sell<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Personally  Identifiable Information to third parties except as permitted by this Privacy  Policy. If you receive information through AMA or through a third party  supplier about AMA that you prefer not to receive, you should request to be  removed from the active mailing list by e-mailing&nbsp;customerservice@amanet.org&nbsp;or  by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-877-566-9441.</li>
  <li>When you contribute to a public area or feature  of our Website, such as one of our online communities, messaging services, chat  services, bulletin boards, message boards, blogs or other such open forums, the  information that you submit will be made available to the general public. For  this reason, we recommend that you exercise caution in the submission of  Personally Identifiable Information to these areas of our Website as it will be  publicly accessible.</li>
  <li>We may disclose to third parties aggregate,  non-personally identifiable data regarding user behavior, such as overall  patterns or demographic reports, as a measure of interest in, and use of, our  Website, e-mails and other messaging campaigns.</li>
  <li>We may use or disclose Personally Identifiable  Information in order to investigate any claim or suspicion of a violation of  our Website Terms of Service, to assist with law enforcement investigations, or  as otherwise required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMA may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to a  third party in the event of a sale of stock, merger or consolidation, reorganization,  or other transfer of all or a portion of the assets of AMA, whether voluntarily  or by operation of law. In addition, such a transfer may mean that your Personally  Identifiable Information is transferred to countries outside the European  Economic Area (“EEA”). In using the Website and the various features and  services made available thereon, you consent to such transfer of your  Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>Website Usage information—Not  Linked to Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s  hard drive. AMA uses information from cookies, for example, to analyze trends,  track visitors' movements and gather broad demographic information for  aggregate use. If a visitor rejects the cookie, the visitor may be limited in  some areas of the Website. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a  cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that  cookie. You should consult your Web browser to choose the appropriate setting  to accept or reject cookies.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In addition, AMA uses various third party service providers and third party  provided services that use cookies, including, for example, a service provided  by Marketo, which uses sophisticated cookie technology to measure site traffic  and visitor behavior in aggregate. These cookies may remain on your hard drive  after the conclusion of your site visit.  To find out more about these practices as related to services provided by Marketo,  please visit the&nbsp;Marketo Privacy Policies.</p>
<p><strong>Clear GIFs</strong><br>
  We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel  tags”) or similar technologies in the Website and/or in our communications with  you. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can  be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other  type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling  the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or  message.</p>
<p><strong>IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong><br>
  Additionally, when you visit the Website, our server  automatically collects data about your server’s IP Address, which is a number  that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service  provider whenever you’re on the Internet. When you request pages from our  Website, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.  Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g.,  another Website or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Website; the  Website you visit after this Website; the ads you see and/or click on; other  information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software  and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Website  or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web  servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help  diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Such  information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as  country of origin and Internet service provider.</p>
<p>Among other things, this information enables us to  generate analytics reports on the usage of our Website.&nbsp; To opt-out of your Website usage being  included in our Google analytics reports, you may follow these instructions.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
  These technologies enable us to assign a unique number to  you, and relate your Website Usage Information to other information about you,  including your Personally Identifiable Information. These technologies also  enable us to recognize you when you access our Website using different Web  browsers and different computers or devices.&nbsp; <br>
  We may use and share your Website Usage Information for  all of the purposes that we may use and share Personally Identifiable  Information as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any or all of the above-described activities  with regard to Website Usage Information and tracking technologies may be  performed by us or on our behalf by our service providers or partners.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We use third-party  advertising companies to select and serve ads to you.&nbsp; These companies may use information about  your visits to this Website and other Websites, the region of the country or  world where your IP address indicates you are located, as well as other  information about you in order to provide advertisements about goods and  services of interest to you.&nbsp; These advertisements  may appear on this Website and on other Websites.&nbsp; These companies may employ cookies, clear  GIFs and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to  you.&nbsp; We encourage you to read these  businesses’ privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information.&nbsp; <strong>For  more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from  using your information, visit the NAI’s consumer Web site at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/  or Aboutads.info at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Disclosures</strong><br>
  Some web browsers  may transmit “do-not-track” (DNT) signals to the websites with which the user  communicates.&nbsp; Because of differences in  how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether  users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are  aware of them.&nbsp; We currently do not  change our tracking practices (which are explained in more detail under the  Website Usage Information section above) in response to DNT settings in your  web browser.&nbsp; <br>
Our third party  partners, such as web analytics companies and third party ad networks, collect  information about your online activities over time and across our Website and  other online properties. These third parties may not change their tracking  practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not  obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. </p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong><br>
We use several social  networking and blogging platforms to communicate with our customers, some of  which are operated by third parties, such as Facebook or Twitter.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to our use of  information you submit to us through social networking platforms and features,  but it does not apply to what those third party platforms do with your  information that they receive from us or from you directly.&nbsp; Those platforms have their own privacy  policies, and we encourage you to read them.</p>

  AMA’s Website contains links to other sites. Some links  are to sites of AMA’s partners that offer AMA customers and Members a variety  of special products and services.

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  AMA endeavors to protect Personally Identifiable Information  submitted to AMA via its Website. However, because the Internet is an open  global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during  transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in  our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. </p>

When you desire to cancel your account on  this Website, it is your responsibility to notify AMA. We will not be  responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to  comply with this provision.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of  your Personally Identifiable Information in our possession or control may have  been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a  notification is appropriate, we would try to do so as promptly as possible  under the circumstances, and, if we have your e-mail address, we may notify you  by e-mail.&nbsp;<strong>You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such  notification.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>If you prefer for us to use another method to notify  you in this situation, please e-mail us at customerservice@amanet.org&nbsp;with  the alternative contact information you would like us to use.</strong><br>

  AMA is a global enterprise, with branch offices,  affiliates and licensees worldwide. When you give your Personally Identifiable  Information to AMA, it may be processed by AMA and its affiliates and licensees  in other countries, for the purposes of, for example, processing your requests,  providing you services, and sending you correspondence.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>AMA is the data  controller with respect to your Personally Identifiable Information collected by  AMA outside of the context of service offerings arranged and scheduled by your  employer, if applicable. Each of these countries has different privacy  laws that afford varying levels of protection for your Personally Identifiable  Information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that exist in  the country in which you reside. Regardless of the laws in place in these  countries, AMA will treat the privacy of your Personally Identifiable  Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<strong>By providing your  Personally Identifiable Information to AMA, you consent to AMA's and its  affiliates' and licensees' transmission to, and processing of your information  in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with AMA's Privacy Policy.<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>You  can get details of the companies and countries to which your data has been  transferred by contacting us at: American Management Association, Customer  Service, 600 AMA Way, Saranac Lake, NY 12983, or at&nbsp;customerservice@amanet.org.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
  If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post  those changes in the Privacy Policy accessible from the home page of the  Website so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use  it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Any changes or  updates will be effective when posted. Under certain circumstances, we may also  elect to notify you of, or request your consent to, changes or updates to our  Privacy Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page  of our Website or sending you an e-mail.</p>
