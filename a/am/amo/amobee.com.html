                      We at [a•mo•bee] offer digital advertising solutions to the largest publishers, advertisers and agencies and mobile operators. In offering these solutions we collect and use certain information about our business partners like you.

                    <p><span class="bodycopy">This Privacy Policy explains:</span></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="bodycopy">What information we collect and how we collect it.</li>

                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Information we collect</strong><br>
                      We collect information in order to provide excellent service to our business partners. We may collect this information in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>Information you give us.</strong> We will collect your personal information if you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, you might fill out a survey, execute an insertion order or purchase order, or provide your contact information to us in person, over the phone or by e-mail. This personal information could include your name, e-mail address, mailing address, tax identification number, credit card information, bank account information or telephone number.</li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>Information we get from your use of our website.</strong> We may collect information about visitors to our website. This information includes:</li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>Cookies. </strong>We may send cookies to your browser to help us determine which content on our website appeals the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. Cookies can enable us to customize the content according to your preferences or to save your password for ease of access. Our cookies may contain personal information, but only if you provide it to us. We also allow third parties to use cookies on our website, and these companies' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policy, not ours.</li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>Google Analytics.</strong> One third party which uses cookies on our website is Google Inc. ("Google"). Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analyzing service of Google. We have added the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" to ensure an anonymous collection of IP addresses (known as "IP masking"). Google Analytics is based on cookies. The cookie-generated information about your use of this website is transmitted to and stored by Google's servers in the US. Due to IP masking, the IP address is only transferred in shortened and hence anonymous format. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activities and further use of the website and Internet related services. The shortened IP address provided by your browser will not be merged with other data from Google. You may refuse the storage of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. We would point out though, that in case you might not be able to use all features of this site completely. You can also prevent the detection of data generated by the cookie and to your use of the website related data (including any part of your IP address) to Google and the processing of these data by Google, by using the following link (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a>) to download and install the provided browser plug-in. Further information about Google Analytics and data protection is available here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a> or under: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html</a>.</li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>Browser information. </strong>We may collect information sent by your browser to better understand our customers. For example, we may collect information regarding your IP address, referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>How we use information we collect</strong><br>
                      We use the information we collect as reasonably necessary for our corporate functions. This includes carrying out our contractual obligations, if you are a supplier or customer.<br>
                      We may also solicit future business with you, unless you have requested otherwise. By providing your personal information to us, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time and other telemarketing laws or rules. Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we reserve the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy">We do not have business partners age 12 or under, therefore we will never knowingly collect any personal information about children age 12 or under. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child age 12 or under, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. <br>
                      We process personal information on our servers in many countries around the world, including the United States. We may transfer your personal information to the United States.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Transparency and choice</strong><br>
                      People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy">As a visitor to our website, you can disable cookies by changing the settings in your browser, but if you do so, you will not be able to use all the features and functionality of our website.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy">We may send e-mails to our business partners from time to time. You can opt out of these e-mails by sending a message to <a href="mailto:corporateunsubscribe@amobee.com">corporateunsubscribe@amobee.com</a> .</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Information we share</strong><br>
                      We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of [a•mo•bee] unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>For external processing</strong>. We may disclose your personal information to third party service providers and vendors in order to effect or carry out any transaction that you have requested from us or as necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. This includes e-mail service providers, providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, and data enhancement, suppression and validation services. Adconion contractually prohibits the sale or transfer of personal information by such service providers and vendors.</li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>For legal reasons. </strong>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of [a•mo•bee] if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
                        <ul>
                          <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>
                          <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or</li>
                          <li>protect against harm to the rights, reputation, property or safety of [a•mo•bee], our clients, our consumers or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li class="bodycopy"><strong>In connection with a merger or sale. </strong>If we enter into discussions to sell, merge or otherwise reorganize our business, we reserve the right to transfer and disclose all data (including personal and anonymous user information) to prospective and/or actual purchasers or investors. We will require that such purchasers/investors treat the transferred data as described in the Privacy Policy that exists prior to the change unless and until you consent to a new Privacy Policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Accessing and updating your personal information</strong><br>
                      If your personal information is wrong, we strive to allow you to update it quickly or to delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.<br>
                      We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy">Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it wouldrequire a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy">If you are a California resident you have the right to request information regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually. Please contact <a href="mailto:businesspartnerprivacy@amobee.com">businesspartnerprivacy@amobee.com</a> &nbsp;for these requests.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Information security</strong><br>
                      We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Please be advised that, although we take reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our website is at your own risk.</p>
                    <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Changes</strong><br>
                      We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time without notice. However, these changes will not reduce your privacy on a retrospective basis. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page.</p>
