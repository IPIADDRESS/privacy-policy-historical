            <p class="bodycopy">A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our site.</p>
            <p class="bodycopy">We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. </p>
            <p class="bodycopy"><strong>Web Beacons / Gifs</strong><br>
              Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We  do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to      analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around      the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a      whole.<br>
                  <br>
                  We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal      Information.<br>

                <li class="bodycopy"><strong>3rd Party Tracking </strong>- The use of cookies by our      tracking utility is not covered by our privacy statement.&nbsp; We do not      have access or control over these cookies.&nbsp; Our tracking utility uses      session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. Our      third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),      images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site.
