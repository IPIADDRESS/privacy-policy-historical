<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Privacy Notice for the Amnesty International USA Web site</strong></font></p>

<p>This is the web site for Amnesty International USA. Amnesty International USA has created this privacy notice to demonstrate our firm commitment to internet privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. The type and amount of information received depends on how you use the site.</p>

<p>Amnesty International USA reserves the right to modify the information contained on this site at anytime without notice. This site and all information and materials on it are provided to you "as is" without warranty of any kind.</p>

<br>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Normal Website Usage</strong></font></p>

<p>You can visit most portions of Amnesty International USA's web site without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal website visit is the name of your Internet service provider, the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. </p>

<p>We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors. During a normal web site visit, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number or social security of the visitor. </p>

<p>We collect the IP addresses of visitors, time of access, browser type, and web pages visited. We collect this information on an aggregate basis only. For example, we track which pages are most popular among visitors as a whole. This information is used for internal review only and not shared with third parties. We do not track information on which pages an individual visitor might look at during a visit to our site. We do not collect any other information without the visitor's knowledge and permission.</p>

<br>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></font></p>

<p>There are instances where Amnesty International USA requests personally identifiable information to provide you with services or correspondence (such as petitions and actions). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by Amnesty International USA and is used to fulfill your request. Amnesty International USA makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The information you provide is used by Amnesty International USA to improve the services we provide our visitors.</p>

<p>Amnesty International may sell, rent, or exchange limited personally identifiable information (such as name and mailing address) of persons who join or donate with partner organizations unless the user has specified that they do not wish the information to be disclosed (See Opting Out below).  Amnesty International does not sell, rent or exchange e-mail addresses to partners.  Amnesty International, likewise, does not disclose any financial information to partners.</p>

<p>Some of the activist functions of our site require registration or personal information (like their name and email address). We use this information to track the usage of these features. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.</p>

<p>Our site uses order forms for users to request information, products and services, or to make donations. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our users. The user's contact information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings.</p>

<p>The AIUSA Web site will not post personal contact information for volunteers, including their email address, street address and phone numbers, without that individual's consent. Staff and volunteers who submit material for the Web site are responsible for securing permission from any volunteer whose personal contact information is to be posted on the Web site and for communicating that consent to Web site staff.  Without such consent, Web site staff will withhold posting personal contact information for that individual.</p>
