<a name="1" id="1"></a>1. INTERPRETATION</strong> <br>
1.1 In this Privacy Policy: <br>
1.1.1 This privacy policy applies only to our Amnesty International UK (AIUK) websites ('the sites') that are under the parent domain of amnesty.org.uk (and includes protectthehuman.com)<br>
1.1.2 'we', 'us', 'Amnesty International UK' and AIUK mean Amnesty International United
Kingdom Section, a private company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England
and Wales with registration no. 01735872, whose registered office is at Human
Rights Action Centre, 17-25 New Inn Yard, London, EC2A 3EA, which owns and operates
the Sites. <br>
1.1.3 This privacy policy explains how AIUK uses the information it collects about you and procedures that AIUK has in place to safeguard your privacy. AIUK is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Under the Data Protection Act 1998 AIUK has a legal duty to protect any personal information it collects from you.<br>
1.1.4 AIUK does not capture and store any personal information about an individual who accesses this website, except where he or she voluntarily chooses to give AIUK personal information via email, or by using an electronic form on the website, or by enquiring about any of AIUK's services.<br>
<br><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. INTRODUCTION </strong><br>
2.1 The Sites provide various services which include, but are not limited to,
providing information on and encouraging participation in Amnesty International
UK's various campaigns to stand up for humanity and human rights and protecting
individuals wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied; and providing
an online community for like-minded people to take action together. <br>
2.2 The Sites are UK-based websites and we take reasonable care to comply with
the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 ('the Act') relating to the
personal information you supply on the Sites. &nbsp; <br>
2.3 For the purpose of the Act, we are the data controller. If you have any queries
concerning this Privacy Policy or the way in which your personal data is used
by us, please contact our Supporter Care Team via sct@amnesty.org.uk or by phone on +44 (0) 20 7033 1777.<br>
<br><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. CHILDREN </strong><br>
3.1 The Sites are aimed at people who are aged 14 years old and over.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;
are aged 14 to 18, we advise you to inform your parent or legal guardian that
you are registering on and/or using the Sites.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 14,
you may not register on and/or use the Sites or submit any personal information
to any of the Sites. <br>
3.2 If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from any
person under the age of 14, we will delete this information as soon as possible. <br>
<br><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>4. YOUR PERSONAL DATA </strong><br>
The information we gather ('Information') may include the name and address of
registered users and members, their credit or debit card number and expiry date,
and email address. If you have registered on any of the Sites, the Information
will include any personal information which you submit to the Site. &nbsp; <br>
<br><strong><a name="5" id="5"></a>5. YOUR PROFILE </strong><br>
If you have registered as a member on any of the Sites, you may be asked to provide
personal information in order to set up a profile.&nbsp; If your profile is published
on a Site, it may be accessed (and transferred) outside of the European Economic
Area ('EEA').&nbsp; By supplying personal information for your profile, you accept
that it may be published on the Site in question and you consent to such transfer.
&nbsp; <br>
<br><strong><a name="6" id="6"></a>6. UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION </strong><br>

any of the Sites changes, you can update your personal information by logging

<br><strong><a name="7" id="7"></a>7. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong><br>
7.1 We may use the Information you submit to the Site to notify you by email
about important functionality changes and alterations to the Site, and we also
use your Information to provide you with information about our other services
which are similar to those we provide on the Sites, if you have indicated that
you wish to receive such communications from us. &nbsp; <br>
7.2 The Information you give us will be stored on a database and may be used
by us for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp; <br>
7.3 We may also use your Information to help us to know what incentives, appeals
and actions are working well and which are not so strong and to inform future
activity across the organisation, helping Amnesty International UK to be more
effective in combating human rights abuses. <br>
7.4 We care about your details and unless you have agreed we will never
share your phone number or email address. Amnesty will not share the
contact details of under 18s.<br>
7.5 We may permit selected third parties to use your Information, to contact

7.6 We may offer you the opportunity to sign up to a mailing list and/or newsletter,
to participate in a survey or a competition, or to receive information by email
about third parties' products and services, or any other products and services
which we provide.&nbsp; If you sign up for any of these and subsequently change your
mind, you may opt out by notifying Our Supporter Care Team via sct@amnesty.org.uk or&nbsp; +44 (0) 20 7033 1777, or by clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link at the end of every ecommunication you receive from us. <br>
<br><strong><a name="8" id="8"></a>8. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES </strong><br>

without your consent, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
&nbsp; <br>
8.2 If you have subscribed to any of our e-communications, e-zines or e-newsletters,
we will not sell or rent this information to anyone. <br>
8.3 As stated above, we may share your Information with selected third parties
(including Amnesty International UK Section Charitable Trust and other like-minded
organisations), in order to provide you with information about products, services
or issues which may be of interest to you, unless you have indicated that you
do not wish to receive such communications. <br>
8.4 From time to time we may work in partnership with other organisations on
a campaign and so you may receive joint communications from Amnesty International
UK and the partnership organisation(s) in question, unless you have indicated

8.5 The Co-operative Bank Plc shares with us any personal information you provide

information on this may be found at&nbsp; <a href="/content.asp?CategoryID=371">http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=371</a>. <br>
<br><strong><a name="9" id="9"></a>9. TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES </strong><br>
9.1 The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored
at, a destination outside the EEA for our own administration purposes or for the
purpose of any international campaign run by Amnesty International UK and an organisation
located outside of the EEA.&nbsp; Such organisations may be engaged in, among other
things, the processing of your personal details as a subscriber to the campaign
in question and the processing of your payment details, if you make a donation
to the campaign. <br>
9.2 By submitting your Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.&nbsp;
We cannot guarantee that any organisation located outside of the EEA will have
adequate safeguards for the protection of personal data, but we will take all
steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Information is treated securely
and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. <br>
9.3 If Amnesty International United Kingdom Section or substantially all of its
assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its members
may be one of the transferred assets. <br>
<br><strong><a name="10" id="10"></a>10. YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS </strong><br>

<br><strong><a name="11" id="11"></a>11. 'INVITE A FRIEND' </strong><br>
We may from time to time operate an 'Invite a friend' or similar service.&nbsp; This
is a referral service, designed to make it easy for you to recommend the Sites
and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process.&nbsp; First,
you send us your friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the
friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to join a campaign or to visit
one or more of the Site.&nbsp; When we contact your friend, we always advice them of
the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral.&nbsp; We will
not use your friend's details for any other purpose. <br>
<br><strong><a name="12" id="12"></a>12. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES' SITES </strong><br>
We may provide links to other websites.&nbsp; Before supplying any personal information

sites. <br>
<br><strong><a name="13" id="13"></a>13. COOKIES </strong><br>
<strong>13.1 What is a cookie?</strong><br>
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive.

<p><strong>13.3 How does AIUK use cookies?</strong><br>
On our websites, cookies record information about your online preferences, remember information about you when you visit our site and compile statistical reports on website activity. Some cookies are used that are essential in order to provide our services to you.</p>
<p>During the course of any visit to amnesty.org.uk, your navigation through the site is recorded by a cookie that is downloaded to your device. The information recorded is retrieved on a repeat visit to the site by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</p>
<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. Below we have set out the four categories of cookies that AIUK uses on our website. These cookies are:</p>
<p><strong>• Strictly necessary cookies</strong><br>
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features.. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as making payments for donations cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>• Performance cookies</strong><br>
These cookies collect information about how our visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from any web pages. They also allow us to record and count the number of visitors to the website, all of which enables us to see how visitors use the website in order to improve the way that our website works. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor, as all information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.</p>
<p><strong>• Functionality cookies</strong><br>
These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your login details or your choices in relation to our newsletters and subscriptions). Whenever these cookies are used we will notify you before using the cookie, providing more information about the functionality cookie to be used, and how it might improve your user experience. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised. They do not gather any information about you that could be used for advertising or remember where you have been on the internet. AIUK doesn't currently collect this type of cookies. If we decide to do so in the future we will up date this policy. </p>
<p><strong>• Targeting cookies</strong><br>
These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are placed by our third party service provider [although we may also place a cookie that collects this kind of information]. All of the information that these cookies collect is anonymised, although they contain a unique key that is able to distinguish, for example, individual user browsing habits, or log if an individual user has clicked on a one of our suggested recommendations. These cookies can track your visits around the website, but they do not usually know who you are. They remember that you have visited our website and your browsing habits on our website to improve your experience, so that our recommendations are a better fit for you. This information is only shared between us and our third party service provider. Without these cookies, the user experience on our website will be less relevant to you and your interests.<br>
<br><strong><a name="14" id="14"></a>14. SECURITY </strong><br>
14.1 When you submit your Information to us on any of the Sites, we take steps
to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to guarantee the total security of any data transmitted over the Internet.
While we strive to protect your Information, Amnesty International UK cannot ensure
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you therefore
do this at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable
steps to ensure its security on our systems, but we take no responsibility for
any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control. <br>
14.2 Please remember that other methods of Internet communication, such as emails
and messages sent via a website, are not secure unless they are encrypted. &nbsp; <br>
<br><strong><a name="15" id="15"></a>15. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY </strong><br>
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.&nbsp; In this case, the amended version
will be published on the Site. </p>
<p><em>This policy will be updated if there are any changes in our practice.</em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div></div></div><div id="page-tools" class="s1"><ul><li id="tools-print"><a href="/article_print.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'print');return false;">Print Version</a></li><li id="tools-send"><a href="/article_send.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'send','width=300,height=300,scrollbars=yes');return false;">Send Page</a></li><li id="tools-bookmark"><a href="/bookmark_add.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'book','width=400,height=300,scrollbars=yes');return false;">bookmark</a></li></ul></div>
