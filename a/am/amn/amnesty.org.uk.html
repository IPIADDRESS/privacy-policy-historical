<br><strong>
<br><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. INTERPRETATION</strong> 
<br>1.1 In this Privacy Policy: 
<br>1.1.1 the 'Sites' means the websites located at www.amnesty.org.uk,&nbsp; www.unsubscribe 
me.org, www.irrepressible.info and www.protectthehuman.com; and 
<br>1.1.2 'we', 'us' and 'Amnesty International UK' mean Amnesty International United 
Kingdom Section, a private company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England 
and Wales with registration no. 01735872, whose registered office is at Human 
Rights Action Centre, 17-25 New Inn Yard, London, EC2A 3EA, which owns and operates 
the Sites. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>2. INTRODUCTION </strong>
<br>2.1 The Sites provide various services which include, but are not limited to, 
providing information on and encouraging participation in Amnesty International 
UK's various campaigns to stand up for humanity and human rights and protecting 
individuals wherever justice, fairness, freedom and truth are denied; and providing 
an online community for like-minded people to take action together. 
<br>2.2 The Sites are UK-based websites and we take reasonable care to comply with 
the requirements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 ('the Act') relating to the 
personal information you supply on the Sites. &nbsp; 
<br>2.3 For the purpose of the Act, we are the data controller. If you have any queries 
concerning this Privacy Policy or the way in which your personal data is used 
by us, please email our Supporter Care Team&nbsp; at sct@amnesty.org.uk 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. CHILDREN </strong>
<br>3.1 The Sites are aimed at people who are aged 14 years old and over.&nbsp; If you&nbsp; 
are aged 14 to 18, we advise you to inform your parent or legal guardian that 
you are registering on and/or using the Sites.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 14, 
you may not register on and/or use the Sites or submit any personal information 
to any of the Sites. 
<br>3.2 If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from any 
person under the age of 14, we will delete this information as soon as possible. 

<br>
<br><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>4. YOUR PERSONAL DATA </strong>
<br>The information we gather ('Information') may include the name and address of 
registered users and members, their credit or debit card number and expiry date, 
and email address. If you have registered on any of the Sites, the Information 
will include any personal information which you submit to the Site. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="5" id="5"></a>5. YOUR PROFILE </strong>
<br>If you have registered as a member on any of the Sites, you may be asked to provide 
personal information in order to set up a profile.&nbsp; If your profile is published 
on a Site, it may be accessed (and transferred) outside of the European Economic 
Area ('EEA').&nbsp; By supplying personal information for your profile, you accept 
that it may be published on the Site in question and you consent to such transfer. 
&nbsp; 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="6" id="6"></a>6. UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION </strong>
<br>6.1 If any of the Information you have submitted for any account or profile on 
any of the Sites changes, you can update your personal information by logging 
in to your account on the Site in question and selecting the option provided. 

<br>6.2 If you are a member of Amnesty International UK and any of your membership 
details changes, you can amend your membership details by emailing our Supporter 
Care Team at sct@amnesty.org.uk. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="7" id="7"></a>7. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong>
<br>7.1 We may use the Information you submit to the Site to notify you by email 
about important functionality changes and alterations to the Site, and we also 
use your Information to provide you with information about our other services 
which are similar to those we provide on the Sites, if you have indicated that 
you wish to receive such communications from us. &nbsp; 
<br>7.2 The Information you give us will be stored on a database and may be used 
by us for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp; 
<br>7.3 We may also use your Information to help us to know what incentives, appeals 
and actions are working well and which are not so strong and to inform future 
activity across the organisation, helping Amnesty International UK to be more 
effective in combating human rights abuses. 
<br>7.4 We may permit selected third parties to use your Information, to contact 
you about products, services or issues which may be of interest to you, if you 
have given us permission to do so. If you do not wish to receive any such communications 
from us or third parties, you may opt out by notifying our Supporter Care Team 
at sct@amnesty.org.uk. 
<br>7.5 We may offer you the opportunity to sign up to a mailing list and/or newsletter, 
to participate in a survey or a competition, or to receive information by email 
about third parties' products and services, or any other products and services 
which we provide.&nbsp; If you sign up for any of these and subsequently change your 
mind, you may opt out by notifying us at our Customer Services email address above. 

<br>
<br><strong><a name="8" id="8"></a>8. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES </strong>
<br>8.1 Except as set out below, we will not sell, distribute or disclose your Information 
without your consent, unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 
&nbsp; 
<br>8.2 If you have subscribed to any of our e-communications, e-zines or e-newsletters, 
we will not sell or rent this information to anyone. 
<br>8.3 As stated above, we may share your Information with selected third parties 
(including Amnesty International UK Section Charitable Trust and other like-minded 
organisations), in order to provide you with information about products, services 
or issues which may be of interest to you, unless you have indicated that you 
do not wish to receive such communications. 
<br>8.4 From time to time we may work in partnership with other organisations on 
a campaign and so you may receive joint communications from Amnesty International 
UK and the partnership organisation(s) in question, unless you have indicated 
that you do not wish to receive such communications. &nbsp; 
<br>8.5 The Co-operative Bank Plc shares with us any personal information you provide 
to them in the course of setting up and using an Amnesty Credit Card.&nbsp; Further 
information on this may be found at&nbsp; <a href="/content.asp?CategoryID=371">http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=371</a>. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="9" id="9"></a>9. TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES </strong>
<br>9.1 The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored 
at, a destination outside the EEA for our own administration purposes or for the 
purpose of any international campaign run by Amnesty International UK and an organisation 
located outside of the EEA.&nbsp; Such organisations may be engaged in, among other 
things, the processing of your personal details as a subscriber to the campaign 
in question and the processing of your payment details, if you make a donation 
to the campaign. 
<br>9.2 By submitting your Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.&nbsp; 
We cannot guarantee that any organisation located outside of the EEA will have 
adequate safeguards for the protection of personal data, but we will take all 
steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Information is treated securely 
and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
<br>9.3 If Amnesty International United Kingdom Section or substantially all of its 
assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its members 
may be one of the transferred assets. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="10" id="10"></a>10. YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS </strong>
<br>10.1 If you use our secure financial pages on any of the Sites to join Amnesty 
International UK or to donate money to us online, you are going through to the 
website of our reputable financial partner company, RSM Technology Limited, whose 
principal office is at Dralda House, 24-28 Crendon Street, High Wycombe, Bucks, 
HP13 6LS, United Kingdom ('World RSM').&nbsp; World RSM handles all the secure financial 
transactions on the Amnesty International UK website on our behalf. The information 
you provide as part of any online financial transaction (such as your credit card 
number and contact information) is collected only so that the transaction can 
take place. 
<br>10.2 We have a valid secure socket layer certificate running on all the financial&nbsp; 
information input pages and by working with World RSM we are ensuring that we 
are using the best security technology with regards to collection and transmission 
of personal financial data.&nbsp; Also, once we receive your Information, we do everything 
we can to make sure that it is secure on our systems. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="11" id="11"></a>11. 'INVITE A FRIEND' </strong>
<br>We may from time to time operate an 'Invite a friend' or similar service.&nbsp; This 
is a referral service, designed to make it easy for you to recommend the Sites 
and related websites or offers to a friend, and is a two-step process.&nbsp; First, 
you send us your friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the 
friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to join a campaign or to visit 
one or more of the Site.&nbsp; When we contact your friend, we always advice them of 
the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral.&nbsp; We will 
not use your friend's details for any other purpose. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="12" id="12"></a>12. LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES' SITES </strong>
<br>We may provide links to other websites.&nbsp; Before supplying any personal information 
to any other website, we recommend that you check that website's Privacy Policy.&nbsp; 
We do not accept responsibility for the protection of any data supplied to other 
sites. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="13" id="13"></a>13. COOKIES </strong>
<br>We may use cookies to monitor how you are using the Sites, as these will help 
us make improvements for the future.&nbsp; You may refuse to accept cookies by activating 
the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies, 
but if you do so parts of the Sites may not work correctly.&nbsp; Information about 
your computer such as your IP address, operating system and browser type may also 
be used to examine usage trends. 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="14" id="14"></a>14. SECURITY </strong>
<br>14.1 When you submit your Information to us on any of the Sites, we take steps 
to ensure that your information is treated securely. Unfortunately, it is not 
possible to guarantee the total security of any data transmitted over the Internet. 
While we strive to protect your Information, Amnesty International UK cannot ensure 
or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you therefore 
do this at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable 
steps to ensure its security on our systems, but we take no responsibility for 
any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control. 

<br>14.2 Please remember that other methods of Internet communication, such as emails 
and messages sent via a website, are not secure unless they are encrypted. &nbsp; 
<br>
<br><strong><a name="15" id="15"></a>15. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY </strong>
<br>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.&nbsp; In this case, the amended version 
will be published on the Site. 
<p><em>This policy will be updated if there are any changes in our practice.</em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div></div></div><div id="page-tools" class="s1"><ul><li id="tools-print"><a href="/article_print.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'print');return false;">Print Version</a></li><li id="tools-send"><a href="/article_send.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'send','width=300,height=300,scrollbars=yes');return false;">Send Page</a></li><li id="tools-feedback"><a href="/article_feedback.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'feed','width=450,height=400,scrollbars=yes');return false;">Feedback</a></li><li id="tools-bookmark"><a href="/bookmark_add.asp?ArticleID=345" onkeypress="" onclick="window.open(this.href,'book','width=400,height=300,scrollbars=yes');return false;">bookmark</a></li></ul></div>
