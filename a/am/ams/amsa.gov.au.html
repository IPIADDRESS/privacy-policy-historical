<h1>Privacy</h1>

          <h2>Condensed Privacy Policy </h2>
          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>This Condensed Privacy Policy applies to personal  information collected by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).</p>
          <p>AMSA has adopted the layered privacy policy format.  This document provides you with a succinct overview of how we handle your  personal information.<br>
            Our <a href="complete-privacy-policy/index.asp" title="complete Privacy Policy">complete Privacy Policy</a> can be accessed on our website. <br>
          </p>
          <h3>Personal  Information Handling Practices</h3>
          <h4>Collection</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>We usually collect personal information about  individuals directly from those individuals or their authorised representatives.<br>
            </p>
          <p>We sometimes collect personal information from a  third party or from a publicly available source, but only if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the individual  has consented to such collection, </li>
            <li>we are required  or authorised by law to collect information from someone other than the  individual, or</li>
            <li>it is  unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We only collect personal information for purposes  which are related to our functions or activities under <a href="../about-amsa/corporate-information/legislation/index.asp">legislation related to and enabling AMSA's operations</a>, and only when it is necessary for or directly related  to such purposes. We only collect information by lawful and fair means. &nbsp;<br>
          </p>
          <h3>Use and  disclosure</h3>
          <p>Subject to the following paragraph, we only use and  disclose personal information for the purposes for which we collected it -  purposes which are directly related to one of our functions or activities.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Beyond this, we do not use personal information, or  give personal information about an individual to other Government agencies,  private sector organisations or anyone else, unless one of the following  applies:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the individual  has consented</li>
            <li>the individual  would reasonably expect AMSA to use or disclose the information for the  secondary purpose and the purpose is related (or directly related in the case  of sensitive information) to the purpose for which it was collected</li>
            <li>we are required  or authorised by law or by an order of a court/tribunal</li>
            <li>we believe that  the use or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary for one or  more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an  enforcement body</li>
            <li>it will prevent  or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health, or where it  is necessary to assist with the location of a person who has been reported  missing</li>
            <li>it is necessary  for the establishment, exercise, or defence of a legal or equitable claim or in  relation to an alternative dispute resolution process.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Data security</h3>
          <p>We take steps and utilise up-to-date techniques and  processes which meet current government requirements to protect the personal  information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or  disclosure, and against other misuse.&nbsp; These steps include maintaining up-to-date computer and network  security systems with appropriate firewalls, access controls and passwords to  protect electronic copies of personal information, and securing paper files and physical access restrictions.<br>
          </p>
          <p>When the personal information that we collect is no  longer required, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner, in accordance with  the AMSA’s Records Disposal Authority<em>.</em> <br>
            </p>
          <h3>Your choices</h3>
          <p>You can access the personal information that we  hold about you, and you can ask us to correct the personal information we hold  about you. For more information, see our <a href="complete-privacy-policy/index.asp" title="complete Privacy Policy" target="_blank">complete  Privacy Policy</a> – ‘access and  correction’. <br>
          </p>
          <p>If you are listed on one or more of our stakeholder email lists you can opt  out at any time. You can unsubscribe by using the ‘unsubscribe’ options noted  in our emails. <br>
            </p>
          <p>You may interact with us anonymously or by using a  pseudonym, unless we are required or authorised by law to deal with you as an  identified individual or it is impracticable for us to deal with you in an  unidentified manner. </p>
