        <h3>User Information</h3>
        </a> 
        <p>Users of this Web site may differ in their access or needs. We recommend 
          that you read this policy in its entirety to understand your and our 
          responsibilities. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with 
          our server and to administer our Web site.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The information nn this statement is summarized into two broad headings 
          -- customer information and member information. Members who place orders 
          should also read the customer information section. Our site uses cookies 
          when we need to keep track from one screen to another, such as when 
          you log in to <a href="/membersonly/">Members Only</a> using a password 
          or when you use a shopping cart. See below for more <a href="#cookies">information 
          on cookies</a>.&nbsp; 
        </p><h4>Customer Information</h4>
        <p>Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, 
          and services. We collect visitors' contact information (such as name 
          and email address) and financial information (such as account or credit 
          card numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill 
          the user for products and services. Contact information from the order 
          form is used to send orders, information about our association, and 
          promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. This 
          contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when 
          necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#optout">choice/opt 
          out section</a> below.</p>
        <h4>Member Information</h4>
        <p>Members' contact information is made available through the Member Directory. 
          Members' contact information is shared with other organizations that 
          promote statistics or professional development of statisticians. Members 
          may opt out of receiving future mailings or listing in the Member Directory; 
          see the <a href="#optout">choice/opt out section</a> below.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3><a name="security"></a>Security</h3>
        <p>This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, 
          misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Member 
          personal information is behind a firewall, modifiable by each member 
          only by password access through secure forms pages. Member Directory 
          information is not accessible by search engines that hunt for HTML pages.</p>
        <p>Secured Server Certificate from VeriSign, Inc. is utilized to identify 
          your secured connection to our Web site. Personal information ("Basic 
          Contact Information") collected through our site are entered and transmitted 
          over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with a maximum encryption strength of 
          128-bit, which creates an encrypted session between the user browser 
          and the Web server.</p>
        <h3><a name="change"></a>Correct/Update</h3>
        <p>Members can change their address and related information at <a href="/membersonly/default.asp"> 
          www.amstat.org/membersonly/default.asp</a></p>
        <p>Members and other customers can send corrections to ASA by email (<a href="mailto:asainfo@amstat.org">asainfo@amstat.org</a>) 
          or by regular mail (<a href="#contact">address below</a>).</p>

        <h3>Choice/Opt Out</h3>
        </a> 
        <p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt out of (e.g. stop or 
          discontinue) receiving communications from us and our partners at the 
          point where we request information about the visitor. This site gives 
          users the following options for removing their information from our 
          database so as to not receive future communications or to no longer 
          receive our service.</p>

        <p>This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the 
          Web site. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always 
          know what information we gather, how we might use that information,

        <h3>Cookie Information</h3>
        </a> 
        <p>The American Statistical Association uses cookies on this Web site, 
          <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a>, when we need to keep track 
          from one screen to another, such as when you log in to <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
          Only</a> using a password or when you use a shopping cart. A "magic 
          cookie" is a datum sent by our Web server to your Web browser, 
          stored in RAM while your browser is in use, or in a file called something 
          like "cookies" on your machine. Cookies helps keep track of 
          your Web session with <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a>.&nbsp; 
        </p><p>Cookies store information that the Web site uses. Some of this information 
          (e.g., last visited Web site, your IP address, the browser and version 
          you use) are available to ANY Web site you visit, regardless of your 
          security settings. This information is built into the Internet and its 
          communication methods and protocols. Generally, you cannot stop this 
          information from going out. Other information is gathered by user input, 
          typically by forms. In other words, a cookie will not know your home 
          phone number unless you give that information to a form or other input 
          device on a Web site.</p>
        <p>Some sites are now using cookies to differentiate between repeat users 
          and new users rather than going by general "hit" statistics, 
          which are not very specific. In this way, a Web site administrator can 
          form a clearer picture of how the site is used. Cookies cannot access 
          any other file on your computer. Cookies created by one site will only 
          work with that specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read cookies 
          generated by Site B and then use that information for purposes for which 
          it was not originally intended.</p>
        <p>It is the express policy of <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a> 
          that data generated by cookies and related databases will be used only 
          in aggregate form for the purpose of improving the site and site-related 
          services for users. Information from individual cookies will only be 
          accessible to Web site administrators within the ASA office. The aggregated 
          data compiled via cookies and related databases are considered confidential 
          and will not be provided to entities outside of the organization under 
          any circumstances. Our cookies crumble after 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can manage cookies if you edit your browser Preferences/Internet 
          Options (check the Advanced features). You can also periodically remove 
          the cookies file on your machine. However, if you disallow cookies, 
          you may disable access to advanced functionality on our Web site (<a href="#memcookie">members: 
          see next paragraph</a>). For more information on cookies, consult the 
          Help button of your browser or visit other information sources such 
          as the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/">EPIC 
          Cookies Page</a> or <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/">Cookie Central</a>. 
          See also the <a href="http://www.tltc.ttu.edu/Library/cookies.htm">list 
          of cookies pages at Texas Tech University</a>. 
        </p><p><a name="memcookie"></a><b>ASA members</b>: Cookies are NOT used to 
          verify your authority to access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
          Only</a> area of our website. However, they ARE used once the authorization 
          has been verified to allow you access to each of page in <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
          Only</a>, and access to secure committee or other official pages where 
          you serve as an officer. In other words, your password is not contained 
          in a cookie, but your authority level is. Your authority to view each 
          page in the member's area is verified at the time you access that page. 
          While you can access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members Only</a> area 
          of our website without cookies, the quality of your session may be reduced 
          if they are prohibited.<br>

        <h3>Possible Future Privacy Policies</h3>
        <p>The policies below are in development, pending use of this web site 
          for other activities that might affect privacy. If you have any comments, 
          please feel free to share them with <a href="mailto:webmaster@amstat.org">webmaster@amstat.org</a>.</p>
        <h4>Surveys</h4>
        <p>Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as 
          email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, 
          or income level). Responses are kept confidential and are not provided 
          to any third party. If the survey is at the request of a third party 
          who will receive the information, the survey will prominently identify 
          the name and link to their privacy policy. We may use contact date from 
          our surveys to send the user information about our association. Users 
          may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#optout">choice/opt 
          out section</a>. Demographic and profile data may be collected at our 
          site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>
        <h4>Public Forums</h4>
        <p>This site may make chat rooms, list servers, forums, message boards, 
          and/or news groups available to its members. Please remember that any 
          information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information 
          and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal 
          information.</p>
