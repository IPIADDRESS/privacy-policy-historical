		<h2 align="center">Privacy Statement</h2>
		<p>
			The ASA has a strong commitment to privacy, balanced by recognition that we are a public association. This statement discloses policies and procedures concerning information gathering and dissemination practices for www.amstat.org.  
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>User Information</h3>
		<p>
			Users of this web site may differ in their access or needs. We recommend you read this policy in its entirety to understand your and our responsibilities. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our web site. 
		</p>

			<em>Customer Information</em><br><br>
			Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information (e.g., name and email address) and financial information (e.g., account or credit card numbers). Financial information is used to bill the user for products and services. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our association, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. This contact information also is used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#choice">choice/opt out section</a> below.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Member Information</em><br><br>
			Members' contact information is made available through the Member Directory. Members' contact information is shared with other organizations that promote statistics or professional development of statisticians. Members may opt out of receiving future mailings or being listed in the Member Directory; see the <a href="#choice">choice/opt out section</a> below.

		<h3>Right to Change Privacy Statement</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the web site. We will post these changes prominently so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			This site contains links to other sites. The American Statistical Association is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects your personally identifiable information.

		<h3>Cookie Information</h3><br>
		<p>
			The American Statistical Association uses cookies on <a href="http://www.amstat.org">www.amstat.org</a> when we need to keep track from one screen to another, such as when you log in to <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly">Members Only</a> using a password or when you use a shopping cart. A "magic cookie" is a datum sent by our web server to your web browser, stored in RAM while your browser is in use or in a file called something like "cookies" on your machine. Cookies help keep track of your web session.
		</p>
  		<p>
			Cookies store information the web site uses. Some of this information (e.g., last visited web site, your IP address, the browser and version you use) are available to any web site you visit, regardless of your security settings. This information is built into the Internet and its communication methods and protocols. Generally, you cannot stop this information from going out. Other information is gathered by user input, typically by forms. In other words, a cookie will not know your home phone number unless you give that information to a form or other input device on a web site.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some sites are now using cookies to differentiate between repeat users and new users, rather than going by general "hit" statistics, which are not very specific. In this way, a web site administrator can form a clearer picture of how the site is used. Cookies cannot access any other file on your computer. Cookies created by one site will only work with that specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read cookies generated by Site B and then use that information for purposes for which it was not originally intended.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is the express policy of <a href="http://www.amstat.org">www.amstat.org</a> that data generated by cookies and related databases will be used only in aggregate form for the purpose of improving the site and site-related services. Information from individual cookies will only be accessible to web site administrators within the ASA office. The aggregated data compiled via cookies and related databases are considered confidential and will not be provided to entities outside of the organization under any circumstance. Our cookies crumble after 24 hours. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You can manage cookies if you edit your browser Preferences/Internet Options (check the Advanced features). You can also periodically remove the cookies file on your machine. However, if you disallow cookies, you may disable access to advanced functionality on our web site. For more information about cookies, click the Help button of your browser or visit other information sources such as the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/" rel="external" target="_blank">EPIC Cookies Page</a> or <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Cookie Central</a>. See also the <a href="http://www.tltc.ttu.edu/Library/cookies.htm" rel="external" target="_blank">list of cookies pages at Texas Tech University</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			ASA members: Cookies are NOT used to verify your authority to access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly">Members Only</a> area of our web site. However, they ARE used once the authorization has been verified to allow you access to each page in <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly">Members Only</a> and secure committee or other official pages where you serve as an officer. In other words, your password is not contained in a cookie, but your authority level is. Your authority to view each page in the member's area is verified at the time you access that page. While you can access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly">Members Only</a> area of our web site without cookies, the quality of your session may be reduced if they are prohibited.

		<h3>Possible Future Privacy Policies</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			The policies below are in development, pending use of this web site for other activities that might affect privacy. If you have any comments, please feel free to share them with the <a href="mailto:webmaster@amstat.org">webmaster</a>.
		</p>
		<p><em>Surveys</em></p>
		<p>
			Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as an email address) and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age, or income level). Responses are kept confidential and are not provided to third parties. If the survey is at the request of a third party who will receive the information, the survey will prominently identify the name and link to their privacy policy. We may use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our association. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#choice#">choice/opt out</a> section. Demographic and profile data may be collected on our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
		</p>
		<p><em>Public Forums</em></p>
		<p>
			This site may make chat rooms, list servers, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its members. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
			This page was constructed with assistance from <a href="http://www.truste.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">TRUSTe</a>. However, the American Statistical Association no longer is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
