<br>
<b>What personally identifiable information is collected on this site?</b><br>
Visitors may supply personally identifiable information (such as name, address
or telephone numbers) for various purposes on this site. These purposes include
registering to receive e-mail newsletters, requesting further information about
our products, or simply asking a question about Affiliate Window. Affiliate Window
does not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. This
means that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing
any personally identifiable information about yourself.<br>
<br>
<b>How is it used?</b><br>
When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the
information for only that purpose (such as to provide the service or information
you have requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual
information to receive information, manage online services, or apply for a job.<br>
<br>
Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we use personally
identifiable information, Affiliate Window will take commercially reasonable
measures to obtain e-mail consent from you. We will also post the changes to our
use of personally identifiable information on our site at least 30 days prior to
a change.<br>
<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
Personally identifiable information is stored on our Web server and is not
publicly accessible. Further, personally identifiable information is only
accessed by Affiliate Window employees on a "need to know" basis. All Affiliate Window
employees must go through privacy training upon starting with Affiliate Window. Affiliate Window
meets or exceeds all industry standards for the protection of personally
identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
If you have registered to receive e-mail communications from us and later change
your mind, you may contact us to have your name removed from our distribution
lists. You have the following options to do this:<br>
<br>
You can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@affiliatewindow.com">privacy@affiliatewindow.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You can send mail to the following address:<br>
<br>
Director of Privacy<br>
Affiliate Window Ltd<br>
Office 5C2, Juniper House<br>
Seager Building<br>
Brookmill Rd<br>
London<br>
SE8 4JT<br>
<br>
<b>Correct/Update</b><br>
If you would like to verify the data we have received from you or to make
corrections to it, you may contact us directly at the e-mail and mail addresses
provided above.<br>
<br>
<b>What anonymous information is collected on this site?</b><br>
Anonymous numeric information is collected for every visitor to this site. This
includes pages viewed, date and time, and browser type. IP numbers are not
stored, but are temporarily used to determine domain type and in some cases,
geographic region. We do not make any association between this information and a
visitor's identity.<br>
<br>
<b>How is it used?</b><br>
The information is used by Affiliate Window to build anonymous behavioral
profiles, which are written to the Affiliate Window database -- securely housed
at the Affiliate Window data centre. These profiles are accessed by Affiliate Window-enabled
Web sites to offer you personalized content and promotions, and to target
relevant, more interesting ads -- all without knowing your identity. Again,
there is no association between an Affiliate Window profile and a visitor's
identity.<br>
<br>
<b>How does this site use cookies?</b><br>
Affiliate Window uses cookies to identify your browser as you visit pages on the
Affiliate Window site or sites in the Affiliate Window media network. Cookies
allow Affiliate Window to gather anonymous numeric information, track clicks,
sales and lead commissions.<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This site may contain links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click
on one of these links, you are entering another site. We encourage you to read
the privacy statements of these linked sites as their privacy policy may differ
from ours.<br>
<br>
<b>E-mail Links</b><br>
We use e-mail links located on this site to allow you to contact us directly via
e-mail. We use the information provided in your e-mail to respond to your
questions or comments. We may also store your comments for future reference.
Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit
permission.<br>
<br>
<b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith
belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the
law or comply with legal process served on Affiliate Window.<br>
<br>
<b>For more information</b><br>
