Back pain, in most cases, is not an acute stabbing pain but a little stiffness or tension in the back. It can attack any part of the back but lower back is most susceptible to get affected. In addition, the pain can also be felt along the neck, hips or spine.

People always seem crazy about finding revolutionary ways to look gorgeous. Perhaps that is the reason web is today flooded with different beauty-related sites providing you with a plethora of beauty tips and tricks to look good always.



While browsing through the web I came across some interesting skincare and beauty tricks that really worked for me. So, I decided to share them with your people so you too can enjoy a healthy, glowing skin like me.

	Never go to bed without removing makeup, especially eye makeup. The remnants of makeup can clog your skin pores, leading it to experience acne flare-up. Use an oil based makeup remover for this purpose; olive oil is an excellent natural eye makeup remover.
	Wash your face at least twice a day—once in the morning and once in the night. This will remove any dirt accumulation from your face, leaving it looking fresher and radiant. Never forget to moisturize the skin afterwards.
	If your skin is prone to acne and breakout, then always use specialized products to treat it.
	For getting super-thick, voluminous lashes, dust your lashes with a little translucent powder and follow up with several thick coatings of mascara. Hello fuller lashes.. ?
	If you don’t like slapping loads of makeup onto your face, just dust some bronzer onto the cheeks and eyelids and you’ll get the desired glow without being too heavy.
	Get a manicure and pedicure treatments at least once in two weeks. They will enhance the charm and beauty of your hands and feet.
So ladies, follow my must-read beauty tips and keep looking your best all the time.

If you’re new to the game of eye makeup.


Here are some useful eye makeup tips just for you:

Eyeliner

	To keep the eyeliner from smudging, make sure to start with an oil-free canvas. You can ensure this by cleansing your lids with a makeup remover beforehand.
	While lining the lids, make sure to keep the line as close to your natural lash-line as possible. This will make your makeup look natural.
	If you’re trying to create the illusion of larger eyes, lining the inner rim of the eyes with a white eyeliner pencil can do the trick. Add the liner to outer rim too afterwards.
	Most women seem reluctant to use eyeliner in the later age. We suggest you not to give up; consider softer shades of eyeliner instead.
	Apply the liner sparingly to bottom lashes so that the color along lower lash-line doesn’t get deeper than the color on the top lash-line.

Mascara

	Always place mascara near the roots of the lashes not the tips. This will help your lashes look longer.
	Eyelash curler can be used before or after applying mascara. Either way it works equally best.
	Put a tissue paper underneath while applying mascara to the bottom lashes. This will prevent ruining your makeup.
	Using a base beforehand can make your mascara stay on for long.
	Comb the lashes after applying mascara to remove any clumps. Just make sue to give mascara enough time to get dry before combing.

Eyeshadow

	Always pick off the color keeping your complexion in mind.
	Using an eyeshadow shade as the color of your eye can really make your eyes pop up.
	While creating smoky eyes, never extend the color above the eye crease. Just keep it to the lids under the bottom lash-line instead.
