					<p>We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance
						of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
					<p>If you no longer want us to use your information, you can request that we erase your personal
						information and close your model account. In such case, please select "Forget my Data"
						in the "Privacy Rights" section of your account settings.</p>
					<p>Your request will be sent to our Support Team who will contact you to learn more about your request.
						However, if you face any difficulties, please contact us at any time.</p>
					<span>Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</span>
					<ul class="policy-article-list">
						<li>We might retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests,
							such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we close or suspend your account
							for fraud or illegal activities, we may retain certain information about you to prevent you from opening a
							new account in the future. Such information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial
							proceedings/and or investigations.</li>
						<li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations.
							For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations. Please note
							that according to Luxembourg legislation financial related information shall be kept for a period of ten years.</li>
						<li>Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>
						<li>In order to protect our site and your personal information from accidental or malicious loss and destruction,
							we have backup systems. Residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems
							for a limited period of time.</li>

					<h3 class="policy-article-title">Right to object</h3>
					<ul class="policy-article-list">
						<li>We process your data for a variety of reasons as explained in "WHY DO WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?".
							Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific
							purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop
							processing your personal data for these purposes.</li>
						<li>In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have
							legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
						<li>Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.</li>
						<li>Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop processing your data for any direct marketing activities

					<h3 class="policy-article-title">Right to restriction of processing</h3>
					<p>You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved.</p>
					<span>Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:</span>
					<ul class="policy-article-list">
						<li>If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case,
							the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.</li>
						<li>You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case,
							you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.</li>
						<li>You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.</li>
						<li>We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish,
						exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.</p>
