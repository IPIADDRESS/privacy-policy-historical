				<p><strong>I. Introduction</strong><br> This is the official Privacy Policy of the American Wind Energy Association ("AWEA," "we," "us," or "our")<br> <br> The official website for the AWEA is www.awea.org ("Site"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our members and those who visit our Site. This Privacy Policy explains the type of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") we collect, what we use it for, who we will share it with and how we will protect it. This Site is governed by laws and regulations of the United States ("U.S.").<br> <br> If you are not a resident of the U.S. and you chose to join the AWEA or to participate in AWEA events and activities that require the submission of your Personal Information, you hereby freely consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Information to the U.S. and you consent to be governed by the laws and regulations of the U.S. with regards to the use of your Personal Information.<br> <br> Personal Information includes your name, address, phone number and e-mail address and any other information that is associated with your Personal Information. In the U.S., "Sensitive Personal Information" is personally identifiable information that is more confidential or sensitive in nature, such as your credit or debit card account number, social security number, and driver's license. We will tell you how we secure your Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information and also what is the best way to contact us if you would like to review your Personal Information, Sensitive Personal Information or share your questions and comments. For the purpose of this Policy, we generally use the term "Personal Information" to include both confidential and non-confidential Personal Information, unless designated otherwise. This Privacy Policy governs all forms of Personal Information collected and used by the AWEA, and the AWEA Foundation offline and online.<br> <br> We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without prior notice. However, if there are material changes, we will notify you by e-mail and/or by postal mail. When we modify the Policy, we will post the revised Policy on this Site, with a notice on the homepage when such changes have been made.<br> <br> <strong>II. Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong><br> We collect Personal Information online and offline only if you choose to provide it to us. If you choose to complete an AWEA membership application, register for an AWEA conference or seminar, or order a publication, participate in an AWEA event, or make a donation, we will ask you to provide your name, job title, name of company, business address, business phone, fax number and e-mail address. AWEA does not collect home addresses, home phone numbers or home e-mail accounts unless you decide to provide this information to the AWEA.<br> <br> We collect a credit or debit card account number and expiration date from members or other individuals to pay for membership dues, AWEA events fees, publications, audio or video materials and donations to the AWEA Foundation. For payments made offline, we submit the Personal Information needed to secure payment to the appropriate clearinghouse. If payment is submitted online, we use an authorized third-party operational service provider to collect and process your Sensitive Personal Information in a reasonably secure manner. Our operational service provider may also collect the security code associated with the credit or debit card. When members or other individuals choose to pay by check, we do not store checking account information. Payment information is retained for administrative and tax purposes.<br> <br> If you are a member we also use your name and the contact information you choose to share with us to compile an Annual Membership Directory for the personal and professional use of AWEA members. Every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the information contained in the Directory. Online access to the Directory is password protected and restricted for use only by AWEA members and organizational staff.<br> <br> We will share your email address with other organizations that are co-sponsors or co-presenters of an AWEA event. lf you are a non-member, we will also use your email address for AWEA-related promotional purposes only; we do not disclose your email address to non-related third parties for marketing purposes. If you wish to be removed from our email distribution list, please complete the form to remove your email address from our list, or call AWEA at (202) 383-2500. We also share information within AWEA to improve service to our members and to enhance our organization's effectiveness.<br> <br> All third-party operational service providers used by the AWEA are required to comply with AWEA's Privacy Policy and practices. To the extent permitted by law, we may disclose your Personal Information to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or to comply with other legal process. We may also use or disclose your Personal Information to protect the rights or property of the AWEA, and the rights, safety or security of our members, our employees, our Site, or its users, and to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement.<br> <br> <strong>III. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule</strong><br> The AWEA does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.<br> Any Personal Information knowingly collected from a child via the Site will be deleted.<br> <br> <strong>IV.
