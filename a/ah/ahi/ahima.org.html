      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The American Health Information 
        Management Association (AHIMA) recognizes the increased complexity of 
        protecting patients' privacy while managing access to, and release of, 
        information about patients and other healthcare consumers. Credentialed 
        health information management (HIM) professionals—because of their 
        academic preparation, work experience, commitment to patient advocacy, 
        and professional code of ethics—are uniquely qualified to assume 
        positions as designated privacy officials as required by the Health Insurance 
        Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Background</b></font></p>
      <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Healthcare is a service industry 
        that relies on information for every facet of its delivery. Health information 
        has value to the patient it describes, the provider it serves, and the 
        organization it supports, in addition to society as it directs the health 
        of the population. It must be protected as a valuable asset, and in its 
        primary form as the medical record of a unique individual, it must be 
        safeguarded. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Privacy concerns grow as technology 
        increases access to health information. Mental health, substance abuse, 
        sexually transmitted disease, and now genetic information create a heightened 
        awareness of the need for privacy. Documented cases of the use of health 
        information to make decisions about hiring, firing, loan approval, and 
        to develop consumer marketing have sensitized the public to the risks 
        of sharing information with their healthcare provider. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For years, states have written 
        laws and regulations to protect their citizens' privacy by limiting release 
        of information based on the requestor, the type of information, and the 
        use of that information. Due to the complexity of the issue, the number 
        of concerned parties, and the variety of health information, no two states 
        have the same laws. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over the last 10 years, the 
        federal government has tried to address the patchwork nature of state 
        laws by developing comprehensive federal legislation, but has failed to 
        complete that task. In an effort to ensure all citizens have a standard 
        minimum protection, the Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated 
        regulation under the authority of HIPAA to provide a universal floor of 
        protection. However, the industry is already concerned with meeting this 
        new minimal level. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To ensure the necessary leadership 
        for compliance, the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable 
        Health Information released in December 2000, require that each health 
        plan, healthcare clearinghouse, and certain healthcare providers must 
        designate a privacy official who is responsible for the development and 
        implementation of their policies and procedures relative to privacy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">HIM professionals have effectively 
        managed the release of information in healthcare organizations for decades. 
        Establishing policy, training staff, developing consents, releasing information, 
        and documenting information use are key elements of the HIM role. Coursework 
        that prepares HIM professionals to fulfill this role has long been included 
        in the curriculum of all accredited HIM academic programs, and is included 
        in the certification examination for both registered health information 
        administrators and technicians. Since its formation in 1928, AHIMA has 
        supported its members in their efforts to protect patient privacy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Support for the position</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To maintain the privacy, confidentiality, 
        and security of health information, AHIMA members assume a leadership 
        role in compliance with state and federal laws, develop appropriate organizational 
        initiatives, and exercise ethical decision making. HIM professionals are 
        uniquely qualified to assume the role of privacy officials, because we:
