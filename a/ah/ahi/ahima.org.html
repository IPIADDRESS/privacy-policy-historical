      <p>Dear Sirs:</p>
      <p>The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) appreciates 
        the opportunity to comment on the notice of proposed rule-making regarding 
        standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information. 
        AHIMA commends the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) on the 
        provisions of the proposed rule. </p>
      <p>AHIMA is committed to the enactment of comprehensive federal legislation 
        to protect the confidentiality of health information. The current legal 
        obligation of healthcare providers to maintain the confidentiality of 
        health information is based on what the Office of Technology Assessment 
        found to be a patchwork quilt of federal and state laws. AHIMA is disappointed 
        that Congress did not pass comprehensive legislation by its August 21, 
        1999 self-imposed deadline. However, we commend DHHS for proposing standards 
        consistent with the administrative simplification provisions of the <i>Health 
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</i> (HIPAA). It is 
        important to note that the proposed rule recognizes that "A clear and 
        consistent set of privacy standards would improve the effectiveness and 
        efficiency of the health care system." </p>
      <p>AHIMA has consistently endorsed the following health information confidentiality 
        principles, most of which are expressly addressed in the NPRM: </p>

      <p>Our comments are intended to help strengthen the proposed rule and increase 
        it's consistency with the intent of HIPAA's administrative simplification 
        provisions. </p>
      <h3>APPLICABILITY</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends that the scope of the rule be extended to include 
        all individually identifiable health information, including purely paper 
        records, maintained by covered entities. AHIMA will support legislation 
        to expand the scope of this regulation.</i></b></p>
      <p>Under the proposed rule, health information management professionals 
        will be required to manage paper and electronic record systems differently. 
        This will be a difficult and costly requirement at best and administratively 
        impossible at worst. Electronic health records should not be afforded 
        greater privacy protections than records maintained on paper. It is the 
        information content that is to be protected, not its storage medium. Information 
        should be protected by standards that are technologically neutral—standards 
        that are strict and will protect health information in a changing technological 
        environment. </p>
      <p>Further, this distinction does not serve the needs of the patients who 
        are not likely to understand why electronic records are held to a different 
        standard. Patients should not have to determine the electronic or non-electronic 
        status of their health record to understand their rights and to be assured 
        their health records are protected.</p>
      <p>The intent of the administrative simplification standards of HIPAA is 
        to "improve…the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system, 
        by encouraging the development of a health information system through 
        the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission 
        of certain health information." By establishing standards for electronic 
        and electronically transmitted information only, AHIMA fears that this 
        proposed rule may not meet the intent of HIPAA and also inadvertently 
        act as a disincentive for entities to migrate to electronic record systems. 
      </p>
      <p>AHIMA also believes that the disparate standards for electronic and electronically 
        transmitted data may encourage the creation of "shadow" health records. 
        We discuss "shadow" records more thoroughly in our comments on the definition 
        of "psychotherapy notes."</p>
      <h3>160.103 AND 160.504 DEFINITIONS</h3>
      <p><b><i>Health Care Operations—AHIMA recommends that the words "risk 
        reduction activities" be added to the definition of "health care operations" 
        under subpart 1 or 5. </i></b></p>
      <p>We recommend the expansion of the definition of "health care operations" 
        to explicitly cover those activities associated with incident (adverse 
        occurrence) reporting, investigation, and follow-up. Risk managers carry 
        out processes designed to prevent situations that could give rise to patient 
        care accidents. Not all of these activities can be classified as either 
        "quality assessment and improvement" or "in anticipation of or for use 
        in legal proceedings", although risk managers are indeed involved in both 
        of these activities. For example, most of the incidents which risk managers 
        investigate are never expected to result in litigation, and they may not 
        fall within the boundaries of the organization's quality improvement efforts. 
        A narrow reading of this definition might make those incident reports 
        and investigations available to the patient who is the subject matter, 
        and such a reading would lead to regular court challenges seeking such 
        incident reports. It does not appear to be the Secretary's intent to make 
        this information available, as it would likely have a chilling effect 
        on incident reporting programs, which do contribute to improvements in 
        patient care. By explicitly mentioning "risk reduction activities, such 
        as incident reporting and investigation" in Section 164.504's definition 
        of "health care operations," under number (5), "Compiling and analyzing 
        information in anticipation of or for use in a civil or criminal legal 
        proceeding," we believe the Secretary's intent to exempt this information 
        from disclosure would be made more clear.</p>
      <p><b><i>Individual—Disclosures pursuant to power of attorney. AHIMA 
        requests further clarification on "the person informally designated as 
        the patient's healthcare decision maker."</i></b></p>
      <p>It is not clear what is meant by "the person informally designated as 
        the patient's healthcare decision maker." More guidance is needed on this 
        issue. When reference is made regarding healthcare decisions, consistent 
        reference should be made to the healthcare power of attorney. The explanatory 
        information concerning "informal designation" of a patient's healthcare 
        decision-maker is inconsistent with current practices. We believe this 
        could place the healthcare provider in the middle of family disagreements 
        about who should be the "healthcare decision-maker." </p>
      <p>It is unclear as to what sort of "informal designation" would be sufficient. 
        Does accompanying a patient on an office visit qualify an individual as 
        an informal "healthcare decision-maker? Is it enough that if they are 
        in the hospital room when the doctor discusses options with the patient? 
        Although this course seems well intentioned and undoubtedly is intended 
        to enable providers to more openly discuss patient details with family 
        members and significant others, we see a great potential for misunderstandings 
        and conflict.</p>
      <p>AHIMA believes that on the occasion that a person chooses to share decision-making 
        about a particular treatment episode with another party, this should not 
        result in a wholesale abandonment of their right to control the flow of 
        information to that party. </p>
      <p><i><b>AHIMA recommends amending the definition of psychotherapy notes 
        to ensure their appropriate inclusion in the medical record. AHIMA recommends 
        that the definition recognize a distinction between psychotherapy notes 
        and the case notations maintained by the therapist.</b></i></p>
      <p>The proposed definition of psychotherapy notes varies from actual clinical 
        practice. Reports of psychotherapy are part of the medical record. While 
        therapists may maintain separate notations of therapy sessions for their 
        own purpose, this does not preclude the need to summarize psychotherapy 
        in the medical record. </p>
      <p>The proposed definition may encourage the creation of "shadow" records, 
        entries by therapists apart from the official medical record. The creation 
        and existence of such records may be dangerous to the patient and may 
        increase liability for the health care providers if, for example, the 
        patient requires emergency treatment. For example, a patient may be delivered 
        to an emergency department in an unconscious state and require immediate 
        treatment. If a "shadow" file exists that contains critical health information, 
        the existence of such a file will most likely not be known by anyone other 
        than the provider who created the file. If the creating provider is unreachable 
        or overzealous in sequestering the data, the emergency provider will not 
        be privy to all necessary information to treat the patient. Therefore, 
        the emergency provider's treatment decisions may cause irreparable harm 
        to the patient. Further, "shadow" records increase costs and confound 
        accountability. </p>
      <h3>164.506 INTRODUCTION TO GENERAL RULES</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends treating all health information equally, regardless 
        of its type.</i></b></p>
      <p>Because the misuse of any individually identifiable health information 
        is potentially destructive to the health and well-being of patients—sometimes 
        leading to discrimination in employment, insurance, and healthcare—AHIMA 
        strongly believes that all health information must be protected equally. 
        As destructive as the unauthorized dissemination of, for example, genetic, 
        psychiatric, or HIV/AIDS information, so too may be the unauthorized dissemination 
        of information regarding chronic conditions, such as heart disease or 
        cancer. Restricting the legitimate use of any type of individual health 
        information, however, could impede the quality of care and thwart one 
        of the principle purposes for which it is gathered-research in pursuit 
        of more effective cures.</p>
      <p>AHIMA believes that segregating and creating special categories of healthcare 
        information ultimately would be more dangerous than beneficial. The current 
        patchwork of at least 50 different sets of standards impedes our ability 
        to protect confidentiality. Additionally, special requirements for handling 
        certain types of information—such as genetic information and mental 
        health information—actually may be counterproductive to privacy. 
        Special requirements both stigmatize the information and can give away 
        the information's type. For example, when the requirement existed for 
        healthcare professionals to wear latex gloves when working with HIV/AIDS 
        patients, just treating the patient was enough to announce the condition. 
        When the policy changed requiring the wearing of latex to treat all patients, 
        the conditions, in most cases, became invisible. </p>
      <p>Establishing a single national standard will protect information and 
        help healthcare providers and patients better understand and manage the 
        flow of health information. </p>
      <h3>164.506(B) MINIMUM NECESSARY USE AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA supports the concept of "minimum necessary use and disclosure." 
        However, AHIMA urges the DHHS to establish a "good faith" standard for 
        covered entities who disclose the information with a statement that prohibits 
        the use of the information for other than the stated purpose and requires 
        destruction of the information after the stated need has been fulfilled. 
        AHIMA further recommends that covered entities be deemed in compliance 
        with the "minimum necessary use and disclosure" standard with regard to 
        internal uses and disclosures if their computer-based patient record (CPR) 
        systems use the appropriate safeguard mechanisms and meet the forthcoming 
        security requirements. </i></b></p>
      <p>The concept of "minimum necessary use and disclosure" is one of AHIMA's 
        principles for health information confidentiality. Even so, as the proposed 
        standard is currently drafted, the requirement that a covered entity make 
        all reasonable efforts not to use or disclose more than the minimum amount 
        of protected health information necessary to accomplish the intended purpose 
        of the use or disclosure will be impracticable to manage. The definition 
        of minimum amount is highly subjective and there is no clear guidance 
        or bright line test to provide guidance to covered entities. Therefore, 
        alternative means to meet this standard must be devised. </p>
      <p>Establishing a "good faith" standard for covered entities is an approach 
        that would require the covered entity to decide what reasonably meets 
        the needs of the requestor of the information. In AHIMA's publication 
        <i><a href="/products/info.security.html#release">Release and Disclosure: 
        Guidelines Regarding Maintenance and Disclosure of Health Information</a></i> 
        (Attachment 1) , AHIMA recommends the following:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"…That the responsibility for disclosure of health information be centralized 
          under the direction of the provider's health information management 
          professional to ensure compliance with legal requirements and the provider's 
          policies for disclosure. Only a few qualified individuals should be 
          authorized to disclose health information, and they should be carefully 
          trained and supervised." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>AHIMA further recommends that:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"A statement that prohibits use of the information for other than the 
          stated purpose and requires destruction of the information after the 
          stated need has been fulfilled, should accompany any disclosure of health 
          information to external requestors." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The following health information management manuals have been attached 
        to assist DHHS in developing clear guidance for the minimum necessary 
        standard:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i><a href="/products/info.security.html#release">Release and Disclosure: 
          Guidelines Regarding Maintenance and Disclosure of Health Information</a></i> 
          (Attachment 1) </li>
        <li> <i><a href="/products/info.security.html#hiv">HIV and Confidentiality: 
          Guidelines for Managing Health Information Relating to HIV Infection</a> 
          </i>(Attachment 2) </li>
        <li><i><a href="/products/info.security.html#faxing">Faxing Safeguards: 
          Guidelines for Transmitting Patient Health Information</a></i> (Attachment 
          3) </li>
        <li><i><a href="/products/info.security.html#security">Security and Access: 
          Guidelines for Managing Electronic Patient Information</a></i> (Attachment 
          4) </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In most instances, the knowledge of confidentiality procedures and the 
        qualifications of the requestor of the information are not known. Therefore, 
        for the "minimum standard" requirement to work, we believe the ultimate 
        decisions must be made by those who have been adequately trained and educated 
        in release and disclosure requirements. Health information management 
        professionals are prepared by education and experience to make such important 
        determinations.</p>
      <p>Covered entities should be deemed in compliance with the "minimum necessary 
        use and disclosure" standard with regard to internal uses and disclosures 
        if their computer-based patient record (CPR) systems use the appropriate 
        safeguard mechanisms and meet the forthcoming security requirements. This 
        will encourage covered entities to fully utilize the security capabilities 
        offered by a CPR. AHIMA strongly supports the migration of patient records 
        to the electronic environment. As opposed to paper-based record systems, 
        CPR systems can more readily limit who has access to information, determine 
        what information to disclose depending on the request, and track the flow 
        of the information. These functions are critical to provide privacy and 
        security for individually identifiable health information.</p>
      <h3>164.506(C) RIGHT OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO REQUEST RESTRICTIONS ON USES AND 
        DISCLOSURES</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends deleting the proposed standard "Right of an individual 
        to request restriction on uses and disclosures."</i></b></p>
      <p>AHIMA does not support the concept that individuals be able to request 
        that a covered entity restrict the protected health information that results 
        from an encounter from further use or disclosure for treatment, payment 
        and healthcare operations. Since covered entities would not be required 
        to agree to restrictions requested by individuals, this proposal appears 
        meaningless.</p>
      <p> While we believe individuals should have the right to access, copy, 
        amend, and correct their information, giving them the right to request 
        restricting its uses and disclosures is in contrast with the intent of 
        the proposed rule. When addressing the need for privacy standards, the 
        proposed rule states: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"The maintenance and exchange of individually identifiable health information 
          is an integral component of the delivery of quality health care. In 
          order to receive accurate and reliable diagnosis and treatment, patients 
          must provide health care professionals with accurate, detailed information 
          about their personal health, behavior and other aspects of their lives. 
          Health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses also 
          rely on the provision of such information to accurately and promptly 
          process claims for payment and for other administrative functions that 
          directly affect a patient's ability to receive needed care, the quality 
          of that care, and the efficiency with which it is delivered."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Permitting patients to dictate the flow of their health information for 
        treatment, payment and health care operations will seriously hamper the 
        ability to achieve the intentions stated above. The lack of complete and 
        accurate information will only hinder the ability to provide quality care, 
        process claims, and complete other necessary and beneficial administrative 
        functions. </p>
      <h3>164.506 (D) CREATION OF DE-IDENTIFIED INFORMATION</h3>
      <p><i><b>AHIMA supports this concept but requests further clarification 
        on removing information from the body of the medical record that may indirectly 
        identify the individual. AHIMA recommends the DHHS establish a "good faith" 
        standard for covered entities who make reasonable efforts to de-identify 
        information when required. Additionally, we recommend that the receiver 
        of the de-identified information be required to sign an agreement not 
        to re-identify or link the information to the individual(s) to whom it 
        pertains. AHIMA believes that the proposed rule should make it a violation 
        to attempt to re-identify or re-link the previously de-identified information 
        to the individual(s) to whom it pertains.</b></i></p>
      <p>The proposed rule's intent to encourage the creation and use of de-identified 
        information is positive. However, the list of 19 potential identifiers 
        that must be removed from a record to create de-identified health information 
        establishes a difficult standard as some identifiers may be buried in 
        lengthy text fields. Nonetheless, this is a worthy standard and the migration 
        to the CPR will greatly enhance compliance.</p>
      <p>Establishing a "good faith" standard for covered entities is an approach 
        that requires the covered entity to decide what reasonably can be removed 
        from the patient's health information. As an additional precaution, AHIMA 
        believes that a signed agreement between the covered entity and the receiver 
        of the de-identified information would be an adequate deterrent, under 
        the threat of violating the rule, to any attempts by the receiver to re-identify 
        or link the information to the individual(s) to whom it pertains. </p>
      <h3>164.506(E) BUSINESS PARTNERS</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends that transcription services be specifically included 
        as business partners.</i></b></p>
      <p>Outsourcing transcription services is a regular business practice of 
        healthcare facilities. These services can be provided from an individual's 
        home, a central business location, or even beyond the borders of the United 
        States. No matter where transcription services are located they normally 
        receive highly sensitive and identifiable health information creating 
        jurisdictional and enforcement problems for state and federal agencies. 
        Therefore, AHIMA recommends that transcription services be specifically 
        included as business partners.</p>
      <h3>164.506(F) DECEASED PERSONS</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends that the privacy standards for deceased persons 
        be the same as those for living persons.</i></b></p>
      <p>AHIMA sees no compelling reason to set a different privacy standard for 
        deceased individuals. It has been standard practice to release individually 
        identifiable health information of deceased individuals with a valid consent 
        of the executor, next of kin, or specific court order. We recommend that 
        this practice be upheld in the regulations.</p>
      <h3>164.508 INDIVIDUAL AUTHORIZATION</h3>
      <p><i><b>AHIMA recommends that authorizations be required to specify an 
        expiration date not to exceed one-year. AHIMA also recommends that the 
        use of "prospective" authorizations (authorizations signed prior to the 
        treatment episode from which the information is requested) be prohibited. 
        In all cases, AHIMA recommends that it be a violation of the rule if the 
        information is redisclosed beyond what was authorized by the patient or 
        the patient's legal representative.</b></i></p>
      <p>It is in the patient's and covered entity's best interest to tighten 
        authorization practices. Our recommendations will stem the tide of unlimited 
        and lengthy authorization requests for information; information that, 
        in many cases, has not yet even been created. A valid authorization not 
        to exceed one year offers the patient an opportunity to reevaluate and 
        reauthorize the consent. The "any and all information" authorization has 
        been abused and patients have been basically required to sign away the 
        rights to their most personal information. Additionally, the use of prospective 
        authorizations precludes intelligent decision-making on the part of the 
        patient, as they are asked to authorize the release of the information 
        that does not yet exist. </p>
      <p>Further, protections against redisclosure of the information are necessary. 
        As stated in AHIMA's publication <i><a href="/products/info.security.html#release">Release 
        and Disclosure: Guidelines Regarding Maintenance and Disclosure of Health 
        Information</a></i> (attachment 1):</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"When information from health records is provided to authorized external 
          users, this information should be accompanied by a statement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prohibiting use of the information for other than the stated purpose; 
          </li>
          <li> Prohibiting disclosure by the recipient to any other party without 
            written authorization from the patient, or the patient's legal representative, 
            unless such information is urgently needed for the patient's continuing 
            care or otherwise required by law; and </li>
          <li> Requiring destruction of the information after the stated need 
            has been fulfilled." </li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>164.510(F) LAW ENFORCEMENT</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA recommends that, except in the cases described in Section 
        164.510 (f)(2), Limited information for identifying purposes, a warrant, 
        subpoena, or court order be required for the release of protected health 
        information.</i></b></p>
      <p>While the proposed requirements are an improvement over the Secretary's 
        original recommendations to Congress, AHIMA does not believe that the 
        requirements are restrictive enough. The proposed rule would substantially 
        weaken current privacy practices with respect to access by law enforcement 
        officers. Under the current language, all an officer needs to access health 
        information on any citizen is simply to request that information and verify 
        his own identity as a law enforcement employee. Health information management 
        professionals across the United States have reported numerous conflicts 
        with local, state, and federal law enforcement officials attempting to 
        access an entire health record, when only very limited information is 
        needed. Current practices at the State level generally require an officer 
        or law enforcement employee to obtain a warrant, subpoena, or court order 
        to obtain health information, and that requirement should be upheld. We 
        would, however, support the limited disclosure of health information for 
        use solely in identifying a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing 
        person, under the requirements and qualifications outlined in the proposed 
        rule. We feel this strikes a reasonable balance in meeting the needs of 
        law enforcement, while still protecting health information from inappropriate 
        uses.</p>
      <h3>164.512 RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES FOR A WRITTEN NOTICE OF INFORMATION PRACTICES</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA supports the requirement that any entity maintaining healthcare 
        information must prepare and make available to patients upon request a 
        written statement outlining its information practices and posting the 
        notice in a clear and conspicuous manner. AHIMA does not support the idea 
        of obtaining a signed acknowledgement from the individual upon the receipt 
        of a notice of information practices.</i></b> </p>
      <p>In the proposed rule, DHHS requests comment regarding requiring a covered 
        entity to obtain a signed acknowledgement by an individual. There are 
        many covered entities for which it would not be practical or enforceable. 
        The administration of such a task would be overly burdensome and inconsistent 
        with the intent of the administrative simplification requirements of HIPAA. 
        Also, due to the number of patients who are incompetent or unconscious, 
        it would not make sense to require that a signed acknowledgement be obtained. 
      </p>
      <h3>164.514 ACCESS FOR INSPECTION OR COPYING</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA supports the reasonable, cost-based fee standard for copying 
        health information pursuant to this section. In addition, AHIMA recommends 
        that a covered entity be permitted to charge a reasonable, cost-based 
        fee for inspection of the record and be able to establish the procedures 
        for the review process.</i></b></p>
      <p>Depending on the size of the entity, copying and inspection costs could 
        vary significantly. AHIMA recommends that the following factors be taken 
        into consideration in determining the fee:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Labor costs for verification of requests</li>
        <li> Labor and software costs for logging of requests </li>
        <li>Labor costs for retrieval </li>
        <li>Labor costs for copying</li>
        <li> Expense costs for copying </li>
        <li> Capital cost for copying </li>
        <li> Expense costs for mailing </li>
        <li> Postal costs for mailing </li>
        <li> Billing and bad-debt expenses </li>
        <li> Labor costs for refiling </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>164.515 ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA does not support the proposed requirement that covered entities 
        maintain an accounting of disclosures for as long as the entity maintains 
        the protected health information. AHIMA recommends that the accounting 
        of disclosures of records be maintained for a period of six years.</i></b> 
      </p>
      <p>Many covered entities maintain health information based on state record 
        retention statutes and regulations. It would be impractical for covered 
        entities to retain an accounting of disclosure for as long as the entity 
        maintains the protected health information. Maintaining an accounting 
        of disclosure for a period of six years would be consistent with the record 
        keeping requirements for authorization forms and contracts used with business 
        partners as well as other documents specified in the rule.</p>
      <h3>164.516 RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES FOR AMENDMENT AND CORRECTION</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA supports the proposed requirement that covered plans and 
        providers be required to accommodate requests for amendment or correction 
        for as long as the entity maintains the protected health information.</i></b></p>
      <p>AHIMA believes that the proposed rule should not have a specific duration 
        requirement for amending and correcting records. Individuals should be 
        able to request amendments or corrections for as long as the covered entity 
        maintains the protected health information. There are many instances in 
        which individuals do not discover errors in their health information until 
        years later when, for example, renewing a life insurance policy. It would 
        set a bad precedent to deny a patient the ability to correct a health 
        information error from years prior. </p>
      <h3>164.518(A) DESIGNATION OF A PRIVACY OFFICIAL</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA supports the proposal that covered entities designate a privacy 
        official. AHIMA strongly recommends that the privacy official be a credentialed 
        health information management professional.</i></b></p>
      <p>In the proposed requirement, the privacy official is to "serve as the 
        official responsible for the development of policies and procedures for 
        the use and disclosure of health information." This describes the role 
        that health information management professionals have traditionally held. 
        Health information management professionals are qualified by education 
        and experience to be privacy officials as they are educated and pass a 
        certification examination that cover the 12 knowledge clusters shown in 
        the attachment entitled "<a href="/privacy.att5.html">Curriculum Content 
        for Health Information Administration</a>" (attachment 5). This education 
        includes legal, regulatory and voluntary standards concerning health record 
        content, release, disclosure, confidentiality, and information management 
        technology.</p>
      <p>AHIMA commends the DHHS for highlighting the importance of this role. 
      </p>
      <h3>164.518(B) TRAINING </h3>
      <p>AHIMA supports the concept of requiring recertification once every three 
        years and retraining in the event of material changes in the policy.</p>
      <p>As noted in the proposed rule, AHIMA's publication <i><a href="/products/info.security.html#release">Release 
        and Disclosure: Guidelines Regarding Maintenance and Disclosure of Health 
        Information</a></i> recommends the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"That healthcare providers have their employees, students, and volunteers 
          sign a nondisclosure agreement at the time of their employment or assignment. 
          For employees who will have access to confidential information as part 
          of their duties, signing the nondisclosure agreement should be required 
          as a condition of employment. In addition, AHIMA recommends that each 
          employee, student, or volunteer sign a nondisclosure acknowledgement 
          on an annual basis to remind the individual of his or her ongoing responsibility."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>AHIMA is willing to forego our recommended annual recertification acknowledgement 
        and support the proposed rule's call for recertification once every three 
        years.</p>
      <p>AHIMA strongly supports the recommendation that providers educate and 
        train their employees concerning privacy, confidentiality and security. 
        Institutional policies and procedures should describe the responsibility 
        of individual employees in maintaining confidentiality, as well as the 
        consequences of unauthorized use or disclosure of individually identifiable 
        health information.</p>
      <h3>RELATIONSHIP TO STATE LAWS</h3>
      <p><b><i>AHIMA continues to support federal preemptive legislation as a 
        necessary ultimate solution. While recognizing the limitations of the 
        HIPAA statute with respect to state laws and regulations, AHIMA recommends 
        that federal efforts must preempt state laws and regulations to create 
        a single national standard for handling health information. AHIMA will 
        continue to pursue health information confidentiality legislation that 
        preempts state laws and regulations, treats all health information equally, 
        and establishes a strong, single, national standard for the use and disclosure 
        of health information.</i></b></p>
      <p>AHIMA's situation analysis and position statement entitled <i><a href="/infocenter/current/white.paper.html">Confidentiality 
        of Medical Records </a></i>(attachment 6) has been attached for your review 
        along with a flow chart named <i><a href="/infocenter/current/flow_patient.html">Patient 
        Health Information: Where does it go?</a></i> (attachment 7) The flow 
        chart diagrams the flow of health information both inside and outside 
        our healthcare system. Its complexity helps illustrate why it is necessary 
        to preempt state laws and regulations to establish a high federal ceiling 
        for protecting medical information. </p>
      <p>It has been argued by those who oppose a single national standard that 
        states may have enacted a higher standard. However, in most cases, state 
        laws and regulation address specific aspects of health information for 
        example, mental health and home care. None has enacted a comprehensive 
        and strong standard. </p>
      <p>State boundaries are less and less relevant in regulating healthcare 
        and health information management practices. With the growth of metropolitan 
        areas crossing state lines, continental travel, multi-state commuting, 
        multi-state health systems, the Internet, national managed care plans, 
        and other factors, our healthcare system is no longer a local resource. 
        Health information crosses state lines and between facilities on a continuous 
        basis. </p>
      <p>Health information management professionals handle millions of pieces 
        of health information each day. We understand that the legislative/regulatory 
        actions of one state directly impact health information management practices 
        in another. The only way to ensure that all health information is managed 
        consistently and protected equally is by establishing a strong and uniform 
        national standard with penalties for the wrongful disclosure of health 
        information. </p>
      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
      <p>AHIMA and the nation's health information management professionals stand 
        ready to support your efforts by working to effectively implement final 
        regulations to improve the privacy of individually identifiable health 
        information. Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. 
        If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or Donald 
        D. Asmonga, Government Relations Manager, at 202-218-3535.</p>
