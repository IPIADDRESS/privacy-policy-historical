<p></p><h2>Privacy Statement for www.ahima.org</h2><p></p>

<input type="hidden" value="4" name="page">
The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) has created this 
privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The 
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
this Web site: www.ahima.org. 
<p>
</p><p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, derive usage 
  statistics, and to administer our Web site. 
</p><p>This site contains links to other sites. The site, <b>www.ahima.org,</b> is 
  not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
</p><p>
</p><p>AHIMA has contracted with other vendors to provide services and information 
  to our Web site users. Data collected by these vendors are only used to diagnose 
  problems and to administer their Web site. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Our site uses an order form that allows customers to request information, products, 
  and services. We collect visitor's contact information (their e-mail address), 
  unique identifiers (their membership identification number), and financial information 
  (their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form 
  is used to send orders to our customers. Collected financial information is 
  used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as 
  membership identification numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify 
  the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. 
</p><p>Our site uses cookies to identify specific users and user options for our continuing 
  education quiz system, surveys, advertising banner ad tracking, and online e-commerce 
  system. Cookies are used to customize a users experience in the continuing education 
  quiz and online e-commerce systems. Cookies are also used in surveys to prevent 
  users from taking a survey more than once. Cookies are used in the banner ad 
  tracking system to enable the rotation of ad displays on Web pages. 
</p><p>Online surveys on www.ahima.org and all demographic information collected through 
  them are used for internal benchmarking and research. Identifying information 
  is not disclosed to outside parties or used to contact users unless they have 
  indicated they wished to be contacted for follow up. 
</p><p></p><h2>Public Forums</h2>
        
<p>This site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its users. 
  Although chat rooms, forums, and message boards are only viewable by AHIMA members, 
  please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public 
  information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your 
  personal information. Forums, chat rooms, and message boards are monitored for 
  content by AHIMA. </p>
<p></p><p></p><h2>Security</h2>
        
<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration 
  of the information under our control. This site is part of a private network, 
  which does not provide direct access by outside parties to the server. Firewalls 
  are also in place to prevent unauthorized access to equipment and servers. All 
  systems are monitored for suspicious activity to prevent any breaches in security. 
</p>
<p>AHIMA also employs a secure socket layers (SSL) security protocol, which is 
  a standard industry tool used to provide data encryption on pages and areas 
  where personal data is collected. SSL protects the personal information transmitted 
  from a user's computer to AHIMA, allowing for safe transmission of personal 
  and financial information over the Internet. AHIMA also uses digital certificate 
  authentication to ensure secure transactions.</p>
