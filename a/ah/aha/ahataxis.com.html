We also provide information regarding how you can access and update your information and make certain choices about how your information is used.
        </p>
        <p>The Privacy Policy covers both our “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including any web sites operated by us such as www.ahataxis.com or mobile applications, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g., collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, provided, or made available by the Company. Our “online” and “offline” activities are collectively referenced as the “Services.”
        </p>
        <br>This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of interactive features or downloads that:
        <br>(i) we own or control;
        <br> (ii) are available through the Services; or
        <br>(iii) interact with the Services and post or incorporate this Privacy Policy.
        <br><b>
      BY USING OUR SERVICES OR BY OTHERWISE GIVING US YOUR INFORMATION, YOU 
      AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. </b>
        <br> Please review the following carefully so that you understand our privacy practices. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use any of our Services or give us any of your information. In addition, please review our Terms and Conditions, which may apply to your use of our websites and mobile applications. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the applicable Terms and Conditions. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <strong>contact@ahataxis.com</strong>

        <br>
        <b>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b>
        <br>
        <br> (a) INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US
        <br> We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e- mail address, and mobile number (“Personal Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us. When you sign up to use the Services, you create a user profile. The current data fields that might be requested for are: • Email
        <br> • Password
        <br> • Name
        <br> • Address
        <br> • Mobile phone Number
        <br> • Zip Code
        <br>
        <br> (b) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES
        <br> In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party TPSPs may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. In case of booking via call centre, AHA will record the calls for quality and training purposes. In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. If you are travelling in a vehicle with GPS devices, these GPS devices or the driver’s mobile phone will send your GPS coordinates, during the ride, to our servers. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one’s location to within 50 feet. We collect this information for various purposes – including determining the charge for the transportation you requested via our Services, to provide you with customer support, to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes. Usage Information may be collected using a cookie. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of information to you. You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
        <br>
        <br> (c) INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU
        <br> We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.
        <br>
        <br> (D) INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS
        <br> Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet computer or similar device (“Mobile Application”). You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications. When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:
        <br> • Your preferred language and country site (if applicable)
        <br> • Your phone number or other unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device – such as the
        <br> International Mobile Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID number
        <br> • The IP address of your mobile device
        <br> • The manufacturer and model of your mobile device
        <br> • Your mobile operating system
        <br> • The type of mobile Internet browsers you are using
        <br> • Your GPS-location
        <br> • Information about how you interact with the Mobile Application and any of our web sites to which the Mobile Application links, such as how many times you use a specific part of the mobile application over a given time period, the amount of time you spend using the Mobile Application, how often you use the Mobile Application, actions you take in the Mobile Application and how you engage with the Mobile Application
        <br> • Information to allow us to personalize the services and content available through the Mobile Application We may use information automatically collected by the Mobile Application (including the Mobile Device Information) in the following ways: • To operate and improve our Mobile Applications, other Services, our company’s services, and tools;
        <br> • To create aggregated and anonymous information to determine which Mobile Application features are most popular and useful to users, and for other statistical analyses;
        <br> • To prevent, discover and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to investigate fraud, chargeback or other matters;
        <br> • To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for you, or the communications sent to you through the Mobile Application.
        <br>
        <p>With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that geo-location information for various purposes – including for you to be able to view the drivers in your area that are close to your location, for you to set your pick up location, so the drivers are able to find the location from which you wish to be picked up, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request transportation via AHA’s Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device level. We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your name, pick up address, contact number) to the driver/partner who accepts your request for transportation so that the driver may contact and find you. The companies for which drivers work (that are providing the transportation service) are also able to access your Personal Information, including your geo-location data. We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage information with any Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
        </p>
        Personal Information may also be collected and shared with third-parties if there is content from the Mobile Application that you specifically and knowingly upload to, share with or transmit to an email recipient, online community, website, or to the public, e.g. uploaded photos, posted reviews or comments, or information about you or your ride that you choose to share with others through features which may be provided on our Services. This uploaded, shared or transmitted content will also be subject to the privacy policy of the email, online community website, social media or other platform to which you upload, share or transmit the content.
        <br>
        <b>2. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</b>
        <br> Our primary goal in collecting your Personal information or Usage Information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Services. Based upon the Personal Information you provide us when registering for an account, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email, telephone, or SMS or text message, in accordance with your wishes. We use your information to closely monitor which features of the Services are used most, to allow you to view your trip history, view any promotions we may currently be running, rate trips, and to determine which features we need to focus on improving, including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources. We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that we are able to serve you the correct app version depending on your device type, for troubleshooting and in some cases, marketing purposes.
        <br> We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server, and to administer our web site(s). Your IP address is used to help identify you, but contains no personal information about you.
        <br> We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. In addition, we may use your Personal Information or Usage Information that we collect about you:
        <br> (1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties;
        <br> (2) to process your registration with the Services, including verifying your information is active and valid;
        <br> (3) to improve the Services or our services, to customize your experience with the Services, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you;
        <br> (4) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Services’ features such as online or mobile entry sweepstakes, contests or other promotions;
        <br> (5) to contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to the Services and/or the Services’ policies;
        <br> (6) for internal business purposes;
        <br> (7) for inclusion in our data analytics; and
        <br> (8) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
        <br> Please note that information submitted to the Services via a “contact us” or other similar function may not receive a response.
        <br>
        <b>3. HOW AND WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?</b>
        <br> We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics and log data, with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, to deliver targeted advertising about other products or services, or for other business purposes. We do not sell, share, rent or trade the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy or at the time you provide your information.

        <br> Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than our web site(s). For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting our web site(s), you may be served an advertisement for nursing- related programs when you visit a site other than our web site(s). The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. 1 The information used for targeted advertising either comes from us or through third party website publishers.
