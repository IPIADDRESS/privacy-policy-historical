<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>EFFECTIVE: May 1, 2013</p>

<p>We'll try to make this as painless as possible, but the reality is that all Privacy
Policies contain legalese.</p>

<p>We respect your privacy and privacy is important to us. This policy sets out
our privacy practices, explains how we handle the information we collect when
you visit and use the Aha! website and services and
use the documentation. When you use Aha! services, you are consenting to the
collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your
information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Privacy is important so please
read it carefully.</p>

<p>If you have feedback or
suggestions on how to make our Privacy policy better, please email us at
<a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>At Aha! Labs Inc.,
we respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our website, 
<a href="http://aha.io/">http://aha.io/</a> (together with the other
websites we own and control, the "Aha! Labs Inc. Websites"), and our customers
who use our on-demand product innovation management solution, tools and
services offered on the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites (together with the Aha! Labs
Inc. Websites, the "Service").  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains
how we collect and use visitors' and customers' information, particularly
personal information, as part of the Service. The information Aha! Labs
Inc. collects and uses is limited to the purpose for
which customers engage Aha! Labs Inc. and other purposes expressly described in
this Policy. Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is
meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites,
whether or not you are a user of Aha! Labs Inc's on-demand product
innovation management solution.</p>

<h2>What do we mean by Personal Information?</h2>

<p>In this Policy, "personal information" means information or an information
set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Aha! Labs Inc. to
identify an individual. Except as described in this Policy, Aha! Labs
Inc. will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third
party.</p>

<p>Personal information does not include "Usage Data" which we define as
encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data
we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which
 does not contain personally identifying
information Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the
Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the
Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share
Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service
providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our
customers' needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and
marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a
way that would enable them to identify you personally.</p>

<h2>How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?</h2>

<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>

<p>When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as
your name, address, phone number, e-mail address
and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your
company name and product name. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial
account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and
until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service.
Aha! Labs Inc. uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card
processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use
your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on
Aha! Labs Inc's behalf.</p>

<p>Aha! Labs Inc. may use the personal information you provide to operate the
Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and
authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your
use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out
option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and
functionality of the Service.</p>

<p>Aha! Labs Inc. may also share your personal information with its third-party
service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to
provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other
services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user
experience. </p>

<p>The Service does not support "do not track" requests.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>As is true with most websites, Aha! Labs Inc.
gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This
information includes internet protocol addresses as
well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating
system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect
personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to
improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this
information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and
maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>A "cookie" is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your
computer's hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web
server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or
login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display
the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other 
information which we consider to be of interest to you.
By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences
through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience.
Cookies don't give us access to users' computers, and the information we
collect through cookies doesn't include personal information.</p>

<p>When you use the Service we utilize "session cookies," which allow us to
uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your
online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when
you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize
"persistent cookies" to identify you as an Aha! Labs
Inc. customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use
the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close
your web browser or turn off your computer.</p>

<p>We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along
with the options available to you to manage them.</p>

<p><em>Essential:</em> Essential cookies are those that are
critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to
keep a user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the
user returns to the Service.</p>

<p><em>Functional:</em> We use functional cookies to track
users' activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve
their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember
configurations of the Service that you can customize.</p>

<p><em>Marketing:</em> We may engage
third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us
track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from
visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites. This
information does not include personal information though we may reassociate
 this information with personal information we
have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to
track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party
advertising networks that we utilize. These ad networks follow online
activities of visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites and use this information
to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Aha! Labs Inc.
Websites or on other websites you visit that we believe would most effectively
promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect
information that assists us in other methods of "remarketing" our Service to
visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites, including customized email
communications.</p>

<p>You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through functionality
built into your web browser.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them,
please visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>
for detailed guidance. In addition, certain third party advertising networks,
including Google, permit users to opt out of or customize preferences
associated with your internet browsing. To learn
more about this feature from Google, click <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">here</a>.
Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browser's ability to
accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many
features of the Service.</p>

<p>Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users
as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain
the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you
are a customer of Aha! Labs Inc., it is your responsibility to inform the individuals
with whom you interact using the Service as to the types of cookies utilized in
the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require
more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the
Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by
email at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a></p>

<h3>Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We may also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the
Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used
to track the online movements of internet users.
Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web
beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information
gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use 
them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been
opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service.
You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions
within such marketing emails.</p>

<h2>Other Information Sharing</h2>

<p>In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal
information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may
also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to
investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
</p>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>The Service contains links to other websites and web applications that are
not owned or controlled by Aha! Labs Inc. Please be aware that we do not
determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of
such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the
Service, and read the terms of service and privacy statements of other websites
and web applications linked to the Service. This Policy applies only to
information collected by the Service.</p>

<h2>Public Forums</h2>

<p>The Service (including the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites) offers publicly-accessible
 blogs or community forums. You
should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may
be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community
forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to
remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are
unable to do so and why.</p>

<h2>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews</h2>

<p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Aha! Labs Inc. 
Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain
the customers; consent to post their names along with their testimonials.</p>

<h2>Protection of Information</h2>

<p>Aha! Labs Inc. is committed to ensuring the security of your personal
information. We utilize precautions to protect the confidentiality and security
of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological,
physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and other
security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as
login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the
transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure
that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you
authorized to access your data. However, no internet,
e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so
you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</p>

<h2>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice </h2>

<p>Aha! Labs Inc. complies
with the US &amp; EU and US &amp; Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for
protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the
United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>We frequently enter
agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which
includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing
our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored
or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we
are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and
only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by
law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the
use of such information. As such, we are only the "data processors" and not the
"data controllers" of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU
Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on
Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and
send it to Aha! Labs Inc. for processing, are the
"controllers: of that data and are responsible for compliance with the
Directive. In particular, Aha! Labs Inc.Õs customers are responsible for
complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the
relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Aha! Labs Inc.
for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their
customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>

<p>As the processors of
personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions
with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement
appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against
unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of,
or damage to, personal information.</p>

<h2>Choice</h2>

<p>If you are a Aha! Labs Inc. customer and would like
to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Aha! Labs Inc. please
contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in
each marketing email. Please note that if you are a trial or paying customer,
you can not opt out of service and system generated
emails. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also
be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or
impossible to provide the Service in this manner.</p>

<h2>Correcting and Updating Your Information </h2>

<p>Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided
Aha! Labs Inc. by logging into the Service and providing such additional
information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to
gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as "data
controllers," please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>Aha! Labs Inc. will retain personal information we process on behalf of our
customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to
our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this
personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may make material changes to this Policy. We encourage you to
periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be
bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept
the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.</p>
