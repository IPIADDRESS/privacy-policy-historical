<h3>Web site information collection and dissemination 
practices 
</h3>
<p>
We use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems 
with our server and to administer our web site. We analyse our web 
site logs to improve the relevance of content featured on the site. 
While these logs are IP identifiable, no attempt is made to link 
them with any individuals that browse the site. The site uses cookies 
simply to ensure a persistent client state. We also send session 
numbers and keys as cookies to ensure that your connection, when 
using our online services, is kept as secure as possible.
</p>
<h3>Registration Forms </h3>

The site’s registration form requires users to provide contact information 
(such as name; email; and postal address). This information is stored 
on a database that allows us to send out email list updates and 
serves as a mechanism for members to sign-on to our online services 
(refer below). The contact information is also used by us to get 
in touch with the site visitor when necessary.
</p>
<h3>Online Forms</h3>

This site uses forms for customers to request information and transact 
with the fund. We collect information (such as email address); financial

We also maintain several email lists to keep subscribers 
informed about areas of specific interest. Individuals must request

<h2><a name="spam" title="spam"></a> ahm Spam Policy</h2> 
<h3>Australian Spam Legislation</h3>
<p>
Australian Health Management Group Pty Limited (ahm) is committed to only sending 
commercial electronic messages with consent and to complying with the Commonwealth 
Spam Act 2003
</p>
<h3>What is Spam?</h3>
<p>
Spam is the common term for electronic ‘junk mail’ – unwanted commercial electronic 
messages.
</p>
<h3>The Spam Act 2003</h3>
<p>
The Spam Act 2003 provides the requirements for the sending of legitimate commercial 
electronic messages and prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic 
messages, whether by email, instant messaging, short messaging service (SMS), 
or multimedia messaging.
</p>
<h3>Compliance</h3>
<p>
ahm has educated its staff on the requirements of the legislation and implemented 
guidelines for sending commercial electronic messages. ahm also has good security 
practice measures in place to ensure that our system or network is not “spoofed” 
or used by others to send Spam and to deal with messages that are sent by mistake.
</p>
<p>
ahm does not use electronic address harvesting software or lists that have 
been generated using such software, in connection with sending unsolicited commercial 
electronic messages. 
</p>
<p>
ahm will only send you electronic messages with your consent, including consent 
inferred from our existing relationship. For example, as a member of the fund, 
where we communicate with you in relation to your membership or benefits of 
the fund. 
</p>
<h3>Unsubscribing</h3>
<p>
You are able to unsubscribe from any ahm mailing list.
</p>
<p>
You can request to be removed using the unsubscribe facility contained within 
each electronic communication. Alternatively, please email <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com.au</a> or 
call ahm on 134 246 providing details of the communication which you no longer 
wish to receive and request to be removed from that mailing list. 
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about ahm and our compliance with the Spam Act, or 
if you want to report any suspected spamming activity, please contact us on 
134 246 or <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">email us</a>. We will investigate the matter promptly and advise you 
of the results. If you are unhappy with our response, you can lodge a complaint 
with the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
