It includes your name, age, gender, contact details as well as your health information (which is also sensitive information). </p>
<h3>Collection of personal information </h3>
<p>We will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive manner. The types of personal information we may collect include: </p>
<ul>
<li>identifying and contact information, such as name, age, employment details, email address and mobile phone number; </li>

<li>sensitive information, including information about health, health services provided to you and claims; and </li>
<li>information about your activities, including sporting and other lifestyle interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect your personal (including sensitive) information to provide you with products and services, including insurance, health related services, information on other products and services offered by us, by another company in the Medibank group of companies (<strong>Medibank Group Company </strong>) or a third party, and to facilitate and assess the provision of health related services to you by us, Medibank Group Companies and third parties. </p>
<p>We may collect your personal (including sensitive) information from you, another person covered by your private health insurance membership, or from a person authorised to provide us this information on your behalf. We may also collect your personal (including sensitive) information from Medibank Group Companies who have provided you with services including health related services or a third party (for example, a hospital, dentist or optometrist or other health service provider who has treated you, employer, educational institution, government agency or adviser that has dealt with you or another health fund if you are looking to transfer your membership). </p>
<h3>How will we use your personal information? </h3>

</ul>
<h3>Who will we disclose your personal information to? </h3>

</ul>
<p>The above parties may also collect personal (including sensitive) information directly from you.  We may disclose your personal information to other persons covered by your private health insurance membership as part of administering the membership and paying benefits. This may include the disclosure of sensitive information about benefits claimed by you under your policy. </p>
<p>From time to time, we may also use your personal (including sensitive) information to contact you (including by telephone call, text message or email) in relation to other products or services we think may be of interest to you. This may include our  branded products and services, the products or services of Medibank Group Companies or of third parties. You may withdraw your consent to these specific uses and disclosures by calling us on <strong>134 246</strong> or (+61) 2 4221 8888 Monday to Friday: 8:00am - 6:00pm or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com</a>.  </p>
<p>We will handle all personal (including sensitive information) we collect from third parties about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Our range of products and services and our functions and activities, as well as those of our contracted service providers, may change from time to time. </p>
<p>If you do not provide personal information requested of you to us, or allow disclosure between us, we may be unable to provide you with insurance cover, pay you benefits or provide you with or facilitate the provision of other services. </p>
<h3>What health related services are provided by Medibank Group Companies? </h3>

<p>If you use health related services, Medibank Group Companies will disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us in order for us to pay benefits for health related services and to review, develop and improve the services. In order to perform the above functions, the Medibank Group Companies may disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us, each other and to third parties such as their agents, service providers and professional advisors, health service providers, persons authorised by or responsible for you, and to other parties to whom they are authorised or required by law to disclose information including government agencies, and these parties may collect that information. </p>
<p>In addition to the collections, uses and disclosures described above, Medibank Group Companies may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to us and each other in order for us and them to assess from what other services you may benefit and to facilitate the provision of such services. We may also disclose your personal (including sensitive) information to Medibank Group Companies, so the Medibank Group Companies may have an integrated view and provide you a better and personalised service. Medibank Group Companies may use your personal (including sensitive) information to contact you (including by telephone call, text message or email) in relation to their services. You may withdraw your consent to these specific uses and disclosures by calling us on <strong>134 246</strong> or (+61) 2 4221 8888 Monday to Friday: 8:00am - 6:00pm or emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com</a>.

<h3>How do we manage the data quality and security of your personal information? </h3>
<p>To the extent required by the Privacy Act, we will take reasonable steps to: </p>
<ul>
<li>make sure that the personal information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date; </li>
<li>protect the personal information that we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure; and </li>
<li>where permitted by law, destroy or permanently de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for any purpose that is permitted by the Privacy Act. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Anonymity </h3>
<p>We will generally provide individuals with the option of not identifying themselves when entering transactions when it is lawful and practicable to do so. However, on many occasions we will not be able to do this. For example, we will need your name and residential address in order to provide you with private health insurance coverage or a dental or optometry service. </p>
<h3>Use of Commonwealth Government identifiers </h3>
<p>We will not use Commonwealth government identifiers, such as Medicare numbers, as our own identifier of individuals. We will only use or disclose such identifiers in the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act. </p>
<h3>Transfer of personal information overseas </h3>
<p>If we transfer your personal information outside Australia, we will comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to transborder data flows. </p>
<h3>Access to your information and contacting us </h3>
<p>We will allow you to access and correct personal information that we hold about you as required by law. If you have any queries about how  we handle your personal information, or would like to request access to or to correct that information, please write to: Privacy Officer, ahm Group Pty Ltd, Locked Bag 1006, Matraville  NSW 2036 or e-mail <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com.au</a>. In some circumstances, we may not permit you access to your personal information, or may refuse to correct your personal information, in which case we will provide you reasons for this decision. </p>
<h3>Application of the Policy </h3>
<p>If you are the person responsible for the management of your private health insurance membership, you must ensure any partner and dependant children are aware of and consent to how their personal (including sensitive) information is handled under this Privacy Policy. You and your partner and dependant children (if any) should not provide us with any personal (including sensitive) information unless you and they consent to it being handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>By becoming or remaining a member or by providing your personal (including sensitive) information to us, or by you or your partner and/or dependant children (if any) providing their personal (including sensitive) information to us, for whatever purpose, you consent to, and warrant that your partner and/or dependant children have consented to us collecting, using and disclosing your and their personal (including sensitive) information, however collected by us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>If you provide your personal (including sensitive) information, or if you or your partner and/or dependant children (if any) provide their personal (including sensitive) information, to a Medibank Group Company in relation to a health related service, you consent to, and warrant that your partner and dependant children have consented to that company collecting, using and disclosing your and their personal (including sensitive) information, however collected by them, in accordance with Medibank Health Solutions' Privacy Policy which may be accessed via <a href="http://www.medibankhealth.com.au">medibankhealth.com.au </a></p>

<h2>The Spam Act 2003</h2>
<p>The Spam Act 2003 provides the requirements for the sending of legitimate commercial electronic messages and prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic 
messages, whether by email, instant messaging, short messaging service (SMS), or multimedia messaging.</p>
<h3>Compliance</h3>
<p>ahm Health Insurance has educated its staff on the requirements of the legislation and implemented guidelines for sending commercial electronic messages. We also has good security 
practice measures in place to ensure that our system or network is not “spoofed” or used by others to send Spam and to deal with messages that are sent by mistake.
</p>
<p>
We do not use electronic address harvesting software or lists that have been generated using such software, in connection with sending unsolicited commercial 
electronic messages. We will only send you electronic messages with your consent, including consent inferred from our existing relationship. For example, as a member of the fund, 
where we communicate with you in relation to your membership. </p>
<h3>Unsubscribing</h3>
<p>You are able to unsubscribe from any ahm Health Insurance mailing list. You can request to be removed using the unsubscribe facility contained within 
each electronic communication. Alternatively, please email <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com.au</a> or 
call us on <strong>134 246</strong> providing details of the communication which you no longer wish to receive and request to be removed from that mailing list. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about ahm and our compliance with the Spam Act, or if you want to report any suspected spamming activity, please contact us on 
<strong>134 246</strong> or email us <a href="mailto:info@ahm.com.au">info@ahm.com.au</a>.&nbsp;We will investigate the matter promptly and advise you of the results. If you are unhappy with our response, you can lodge a complaint 
with the Australian Communications and Media Authority.</p>
