				<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
				This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for
				www.a-msystems.com.
				<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
				A-M Systems, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected
				on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information
				to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this
				statement. A-M Systems, Inc. collects and uses information from
				our customers in several ways, including the processing of
				purchase orders, return authorizations, mailing list
				subscriptions, requests for literature, and website usage.
				<h4>Information Requests and Order Processing</h4>
				Our collection of your personal information is to facilitate the
				delivery of product information and purchases. Contact
				information (i.e., name, address, account number), financial
				information (i.e. credit card number, expiration date, purchase
				order number) and shipping instructions may be collected and
				retained.&nbsp; This includes purchase history information as
				required by the United States Food and Drug Administration for
				tracking of regulated medical devices.
				<h4>Mailing List</h4>
				We maintain a mailing list of our customers.&nbsp; We provide
				you with the opportunity to received Product Catalogs, Sale
				Flyers, and other product information in print or electronic
				formats.&nbsp; We also provide you with the ability to stop
				subscriptions to this information.<br>
				<br>
				However, you may still receive literature from us occasionally
				when we rent or purchase mailing lists from other organizations.&nbsp;
				This is always done within the contract provisions provided by
				the mailing list owner, and may not provide us with the ability
				to combine a rented list with the user preferences in our
				mailing list database.
				<h4>Passwords</h4>
				We ask you to select a password to protect your personal
				information when you request information or place an order with
				us. The password will allow you to update this information. Our
				Customer Service Representatives will not ask you for your
				password over the telephone or in writing. For your own
				protection, we urge you not share your password with anyone.
				Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the
				secrecy of your password.
				<h4>EMail-A-Friend</h4>
				If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend
				about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and
				email address. We will automatically send this person a one-time
				email containing the information you wish to send.&nbsp; The
				friend will not be entered as an active member of our mailing
				list as a result of this process.
				<h4>Cookies</h4>
				A cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive
				containing an temporary identification number used to track the
				products and services you place in your shopping cart. A cookie
				can never tell us any personally identifiable information you
				have not already given us. If you reject our cookie, some
				services of our site will be unavailable. Cookies can also
				enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the
				experience on our site.
				<h4>Log Files</h4>
				We use log files containing IP addresses to analyze trends,
				administer the site, and gather broad demographic information
				for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally
				identifiable information.
				<h4>Sharing</h4>
				We do not share customer information with third parties.<br>
				<br>
				We use outside shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit
				card processing company to bill credit card transactions for
				goods and services.
				<h4>Links</h4>
				Our web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that
				we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of
				other sites.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies to information
				collected at www.a-msystems.com.
				<h4>Surveys</h4>
				From time-to-time our site may request information from users
				via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely
				voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this
				information. Information requested may include contact
				information and/or demographic information, and participation
				may require registration with the website.
				<h4>Security</h4>
				A-M Systems, Inc. takes every precaution to protect our users’
				information. When users submit sensitive information via the
				website, it is protected both online and off-line. Sensitive
				information submitted to our website is encrypted and protected
				with SSL, which is the best encryption software available today.
				While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on
				the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
				Microsoft Internet Explorer indicates that all data is being
				encrypted for your protection. While we use SSL encryption to
				protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in
				our power to protect this information offline. All of our
				users’ information is restricted in our offices. Only
				employees who need the information to perform a specific job
				(for example, our billing clerk or a customer service
				representative) are allowed access to personally identifiable
				information. Furthermore, the servers which store personally
				identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
				<h4>Supplementation of Information</h4>
				In order for us to fulfill our obligation to our customers,
				occasionally it is necessary for us to supplement the
				information we receive with information from third party
				sources. For example, with specific permission, we may conduct a
				credit check in conjunction with a purchase order.
				<h4>Updating Personal Information &amp; Opt-out</h4>
				When your personally identifiable information changes, we
				encourage you to log in to our website by clicking 'My Account'
				where you will be given an opportunity to update any personal
				information on record with us. You are always given the
				opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for any
				purpose by choosing to unsubscribe from our mailing list. Your
				contact information will be retained in our mailing list to
				ensure that you are not added back to the list at a later time
				without your permission.
				<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
				If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post an
				updated privacy statement here so our users are always aware of
				our current policy. We will use information in accordance with
				the privacy policy in effect when the information was collected.
				If at any point we desire to use personally identifiable
				information in a manner different from that stated at the time
				it was collected, we will only do so if we first notify you and
				obtain your permission.</td>
