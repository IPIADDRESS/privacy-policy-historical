Football Federation Australia Limited (FFA) recognises that privacy is important and that an individual has the right to control his or her Personal Information.  FFA is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals on whom it collects Personal Information.<br>
<br>
FFA’s Privacy Policy is based on the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) in the Privacy Act and governs how the FFA handles the personal information it collects, uses, discloses and stores on:<br>
<br>
(a) Football participants, whether they are paid or unpaid, including players, Club Officials, Match Officials and Team Officials (Participants);<br>
<br>
(b) persons who subscribe to any current or future FFA membership programs, newsletters or promotional offers; or<br>
<br>
(c) persons who purchase tickets to attend A-League or international test matches;<br>
(collectively referred to as Constituents).<br>
<br>
This policy relates to Personal Information on Constituents.<br>
<br>
1. COLLECTION<br>
<br>
1.1  FFA will not collect personal information from a Constituent unless the information is necessary for one or more of FFA’s functions or activities.<br>
<br>
1.2  FFA collects personal information about a Constituent for the following primary purposes:<br>
<br>
(a) insurance, registration and selection (if the Constituent is a Participant);<br>
<br>
(b) disciplinary, grievance or dispute resolution through FFA’s Grievance Procedure (if the Constituent is a Participant);<br>
<br>
(c) direct marketing by FFA to a Constituent; and<br>
<br>
(d) disclosure to FFA’s Partners (unless a Constituent has indicated that he or she does not want to receive information on exclusive offers from FFA Partners).<br>
<br>
1.3  Where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, FFA must collect personal information about Constituents only from the Constituent.  FFA keeps standard forms to be used when personal information is collected from Constituents. Where the FFA collects personal information about Constituents from the Constituent, FFA must only do so through any relevant forms approved by FFA from time to time.<br>
<br>
1.4  If FFA collects personal information about a Constituent from someone other than the Constituent, FFA must take reasonable steps to ensure the Constituent is made aware of the matters listed in clause 1.5, except to the extent that making the individual aware of those matters would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual.<br>
<br>
1.5  At or before the time (or if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable after) FFA collects personal information about a Constituent, the FFA must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of:<br>
<br>
(a) the identity of FFA and how to contact it;<br>
(b) the fact that the Constituent can gain access to the information held on them;<br>
(c) the purposes for which the information is collected;<br>
(d) the organisations (or types of organisations) to which FFA usually discloses information of that kind;<br>
(e) any law that requires the information to be collected; and<br>
(f) the main consequences (if any) for the Constituent if all or part of the information is not provided.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of assisting compliance with this requirement, FFA keeps a register of standard forms containing the required notice for the particular purpose for which the information is collected. Where directed by FFA, clubs and other third parties must use these forms.<br>
<br>
2. USE AND DISCLOSURE<br>
<br>
2.1 FFA will not use or disclose personal information about a Constituent for a purpose (the secondary purpose) other than the primary purpose of collection unless:<br>
<br>
(a) the Constituent has consented to the use or disclosure;<br>
<br>
(b) both of the following apply:<br>
<br>
(i) the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and, if the personal information is sensitive information, directly related to the primary purpose of collection; and<br>
<br>
(ii) the Constituent would reasonably expect FFA to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose;<br>
<br>
<br>
(c) FFA reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent:<br>
<br>
(i) a serious and imminent threat to an individual’s life, health or safety; or<br>
<br>
(ii) a serious threat to public health or public safety;<br>
<br>
(d) FFA has reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in, and uses or discloses the personal information as a necessary part of its investigation of the matter or in reporting its concerns to relevant persons or authorities;<br>
<br>
(e) the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or<br>
<br>
(f) FFA reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more of the purposes specified in National Privacy Principle 2.1(h) by or on behalf of a law enforcement body.  If FFA uses or discloses personal information on this basis, it must make a written note of the use or disclosure.<br>
<br>
2.2  FFA may use the personal information of Constituents for the secondary purpose of direct marketing by FFA’s members (including State and Territory Federations) and A-League Clubs if FFA has the consent of the Constituent for such use.  In other cases, if the information is not sensitive information, FFA may use the information for the secondary purpose of direct marketing only if the following are satisfied:<br>
<br>
(a) it is impracticable to seek the Constituent’s consent before that use;<br>
<br>
(b) FFA will not charge the Constituent for giving effect to a request by that Constituent not to receive direct marketing communications;<br>
<br>
(c) the Constituent has not made a request to FFA not to receive direct marketing communications;<br>
<br>
(d) FFA always prominently displays a notice that the Constituent may express a wish not to receive any further direct marketing communications; and<br>
<br>
(e) each written direct marketing communication by FFA with the Constituent sets out FFA’s contact details including business address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address.<br>
<br>
2.3  FFA may disclose personal information to ticketing agents, mailhouses or other similar organisations for the purpose of implementing the primary purposes, including implementing ticket requests and communicating Football-related offers.  FFA requires these organisations to keep contact details confidential and only use them for the designated purpose.<br>
<br>
2.4  Despite clause 2.1, the FFA may disclose health information about a Participant to a person who is responsible for that Participant if:<br>
<br>
(a) the Participant:<br>
<br>
(i) is physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the disclosure; or<br>
<br>
(ii) physically cannot communicate consent to the disclosure;<br>
<br>
(b) a natural person (the carer) providing a health service for FFA is satisfied that either:<br>
<br>
(i) the disclosure is necessary to provide appropriate care or treatment of a Participant; or<br>
<br>
(ii) the disclosure is made for compassionate reasons;<br>
<br>
(c) the disclosure is not contrary to any wish:<br>
<br>
(i) expressed by a Participant before a Participant became unable to give or communicate consent; and<br>
<br>
(ii) of which the carer is aware, or of which the carer could reasonably be expected to be aware; and<br>
<br>
(d) the disclosure is limited to the extent reasonable and necessary for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (b).<br>
<br>
2.5  For the purposes of clause 2.4, a person is responsible for a Participant if the person is in relation to that Participant:<br>
<br>
(a) a parent or guardian;<br>
<br>
(b) a child or sibling and at least 18 years old;<br>
<br>
(c) a spouse or de facto spouse;<br>
<br>
(d) a relative, at least 18 years old and a member of the Participant’s household;<br>
<br>
(e) exercising an enduring power of attorney granted by the Participant that is exercisable in relation to decisions about the Participant’s health;<br>
<br>
(f) a person who has an intimate personal relationship with the Participant; or<br>
<br>
(g) a person nominated by the Participant to be contacted in case of emergency.<br>
<br>
2.6  In clause 2.5:<br>
<br>
child includes an adopted child, a step-child and a foster-child.<br>
parent includes a step-parent, adoptive parent and a foster-parent.<br>
relative means a grandparent, grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece.<br>
sibling includes a half-brother, half-sister, adoptive brother, adoptive sister, step-brother, step-sister, foster-brother and foster-sister.<br>
<br>
3. DATA QUALITY<br>

<br>
4. DATA SECURITY<br>
<br>
4.1 FFA will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.<br>
<br>
4.2 Where FFA enters into a contract with any person and FFA’s personal information about Constituents could be disclosed to or otherwise accessed by the contractor, FFA must include provisions protecting privacy of that information in the contract.  FFA General Counsel must be consulted for more specific contractual provisions contemplating the disclosure of FFA’s personal information on Constituents to contractors.<br>
<br>
4.3 FFA will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de?identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed under clause 2.<br>
<br>
5. OPENNESS<br>
<br>
5.1 FFA must set out in a document clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information.  FFA must make the document available to anyone who asks for it and will post the document on its website.<br>
<br>
5.2 On a Constituent’s request, FFA will take reasonable steps to let that Constituent know, generally, what sort of personal information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, holds, uses and discloses that information. Generally, all such requests by Constituents should be directed to the FFA General Counsel.<br>
<br>
6. ACCESS AND CORRECTION<br>
<br>
6.1 FFA will provide a Constituent with access to the personal information it holds on that Constituent on request by that Constituent, except to the extent that FFA is not required to do so under NPP 6: Access and Correction.<br>
<br>
6.2 All requests for access to and/or correction of personal information by a Constituent must be immediately directed to the FFA General Counsel.  In assessing the request for access and/or correction, the FFA General Counsel must observe and comply with the procedures in clause 6 of this policy.<br>
<br>
6.3 Before supplying any personal information to a Constituent FFA must be reasonably satisfied as to the identity of the Constituent (for example, by asking to see the Constituent’s driver’s licence).<br>
<br>
7. IDENTIFIERS<br>
<br>
7.1 FFA will not adopt as its own identifier an identifier of a Constituent that has been assigned by a Commonwealth government agency or any person on behalf of a Commonwealth agency.<br>
<br>
identifier includes a number assigned by an organisation to uniquely identify a Constituent for the purposes of the organisation’s operations. However, a Constituent’s name is not an identifier.<br>
<br>
8. ANONYMITY<br>
<br>
Wherever it is lawful and practicable, a Constituent will have the option of not identifying himself or herself when entering transactions with FFA.<br>
<br>
9. TRANSBORDER DATA FLOWS<br>

<br>

<br>
(e) the FFA has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information that it has transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the NPPs (for example, by adopting appropriate contractual clauses).<br>
<br>
10. SENSITIVE INFORMATION<br>
<br>
10.1 FFA will not collect sensitive information about a Constituent who is not also a Participant.<br>
