  <p><b>A‑dec Privacy Policy</b><br>
        A‑dec takes your privacy very seriously and this privacy policy documents 
        our commitment to protecting the privacy of all our website users and 
        customers. By visiting a‑dec.com and providing any personal information 
        to A‑dec, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>1. Collecting Information</strong><br>
        A‑dec receives and stores any information that you enter on our website, 
        send to us in an order form, or give to us in any other way. [We keep 
        this information only so long as is necessary to provide the services 
        that we describe below.] There are two basic types of information that 
        we may collect. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from 
        all visitors to our website. This type of information is never linked 
        to any personally identifiable information and is only used to generate 
        statistical reports about the use of our website. </p>
      <p>Second, when you request information about A‑dec products or services, 
        we collect personally identifiable information including your telephone 
        number.</p>
      <p> <strong>2. Our Use of Your Personal Information.</strong> <br>
        Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you 
        with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our services. 
        This allows us to make you aware of and offer you products, services and 
        features that we feel will help meet your needs. Additionally, only with 
        this information can we fulfill your requests for products, services, 
        literature, and support. If you choose, you can easily be removed from 
        our promotional mailing list, which is used exclusively by A‑dec. Simply 
        reply to any message with a request to be removed, or call Customer Service 
        at 1.800.547.1883 and give one of our representatives the email address 
        you wish to have removed. </p>
      <p><strong>3.Sharing personal information with third parties.<br>
        </strong>We may provide to our third-party vendors the anonymous, aggregate 
        information we collect from all visitors to our website. As we mentioned 
        above, these statistics will include no personal information. </p>
      <p>In the course of operating our business, we might share your personally 
        identifiable information with third parties. Any disclosure of such information 
        will be done only in accordance with this policy. </p>
      <p><strong><em>Affiliates:</em></strong> We may provide personal information 
        to our affiliated companies. These are companies that own us or are a 
        parent company of a company which owns us or are a company which we own 
        or which is owned by the same company we are owned by. Our affiliates 
        are required to adhere to this Privacy Policy in the same manner as we 
        are. </p>
      <p> <em><strong>Companies that work for or with A‑dec:</strong></em> We 
        may share your personal information with unaffiliated companies that work 
        for or with us for the sole purpose of providing you with valuable services 
        and products you've requested or already enjoy. These companies may need 
        to use your personal information to assist us in fulfilling your requests 
        or processing your transactions. These companies are not permitted to 
        use your personal information for any other purpose. </p>
      <p>In addition, we may share your personal information with unaffiliated 
        companies to market, advertise, and promote products and services to you. 
        This includes persons and entities with whom we have entered into a joint 
        marketing agreement, where we together market either our products and 
        services or those of our marketing partner. We enter into contractual 
        agreements with these companies prohibiting them from disclosing or using 
        our customer information other than to carry out the purposes for which 
        the information was disclosed. These companies are in no way authorized 
        to sell, rent or trade your personal information. </p>
      <p> <em><strong>Protection of A‑dec and others:</strong></em> We may disclose 
        your information, including personally identifiable information, in special 
        cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: 
        (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal process such 
        as, but not limited to situations when we are required to do so by federal, 
        state or local laws and regulations or when we receive a subpoena or are 
        ordered by a court to do so; (b) protect and defend our rights; or (c) 
        act to protect the rights, property, and other interests of our users 
        or others. </p>
      <p> <em><strong>Business Transfers:</strong></em> As we continue to develop 
        our business, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. In 
        these transactions, customer information generally is one of the assets 
        transferred but it remains subject to the restrictions set forth in any 
        pre-existing privacy policy. Also, in the event that A‑dec is acquired 
        by a third party, customer information would likely be one of the acquired 
        assets. </p>
      <p> <em><strong>Other parties</strong></em>. While our contracts with third 
        parties limit their use of personal information, we cannot and do not 
        guarantee that every third party will comply with these obligations. It 
        is possible that such a third party could breach its obligation and use 
        your personal information in a way contrary to our policy. Also, this 
        website contains links to other sites and we are not responsible for the 
        privacy practices or content of these other sites. We encourage you to 
        be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
        each and every website that you visit. </p>
      <p> <strong>4. Security.<br>
        </strong> A‑dec strives to protect the information provided by our users 
        and customers. All of our collected information is stored behind a secured 
        firewall which restricts access from third parties. Additionally, the 
        servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed 
        in a secure environment. We also make an effort to protect your information 
        off-line. Only personnel who need the information to perform a specific 
        job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) 
        are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees 
        are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Despite these 
        precautions, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network 
        security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security 
        of your information. This is especially true for information you transmit 
        to us via email. We have no way of protecting that information until it 
        reaches us. </p>
      <p> When registering for access to a secure area of the site, we will ask 
        you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge 
        your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an 
        unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign 
        out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have 
        finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal 
        information and correspondence when accessing your computer.</p>
      <p> <strong>5. Correcting, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal 
        Information.</strong><br>
        You have the right to access your personal information collected by us. 
        If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, 
        update or delete our record of your personally identifiable information. 
        Simply send email to [customerservice@a‑dec.com] or call Customer Service 
        at 1.800.547.1883.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong> <br>
        We may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy. We will notify 
        you about significant changes in the way we treat your personal information 
        by sending a notice to your designated email address or by placing a prominent 
        notice on our website. You will also be given the choice as to whether 
        or not we may use your information in this different manner. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Contact Information</strong>.<br>
        If you have any questions about our privacy policy or if you feel that 
        your information has been used or disclosed in violation of this policy, 
        please contact us at:</p>
