        <h2 class="page-title">A-dec Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>A‑dec takes your privacy very   seriously and this privacy policy documents our commitment to protecting the   privacy of all our website users and customers. By visiting a‑dec.com and   providing any personal information to A‑dec, you are accepting the practices   described in this privacy policy.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Collecting Information</strong><br>
            A‑dec receives and stores any   information that you enter on our website, send to us in an order form, or give   to us in any other way. [We keep this information only so long as is necessary   to provide the services that we describe below.] There are two basic types of   information that we may collect. First, we collect anonymous, aggregate   information from all visitors to our website. This type of information is never   linked to any personally identifiable information and is only used to generate   statistical reports about the use of our website. </p>
          <p>Second, when you request information about A‑dec products or services, we   collect personally identifiable information including your telephone number.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Our Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
            Our primary goal   in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient,   and customized experience while using our services. This allows us to make you   aware of and offer you products, services and features that we feel will help   meet your needs. Additionally, only with this information can we fulfill your   requests for products, services, literature, and support. If you choose, you can   easily be removed from our promotional mailing list, which is used exclusively   by A‑dec. Simply reply to any message with a request to be removed, or call   Customer Service at 1.800.547.1883 and give one of our representatives the email   address you wish to have removed. </p>
          <p><strong>3. Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
            We may   provide to our third-party vendors the anonymous, aggregate information we   collect from all visitors to our website. As we mentioned above, these   statistics will include no personal information. </p>
          <p>In the course of operating our business, we might share your personally   identifiable information with third parties. Any disclosure of such information   will be done only in accordance with this policy. </p>
          <p><strong><em>Affiliates:</em></strong> We may provide personal information to   our affiliated companies. These are companies that own us or are a parent   company of a company which owns us or are a company which we own or which is   owned by the same company we are owned by. Our affiliates are required to adhere   to this Privacy Policy in the same manner as we are. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Companies that work for or with A‑dec:</strong></em> We may share   your personal information with unaffiliated companies that work for or with us   for the sole purpose of providing you with valuable services and products you've   requested or already enjoy. These companies may need to use your personal   information to assist us in fulfilling your requests or processing your   transactions. These companies are not permitted to use your personal information   for any other purpose. </p>
          <p>In addition, we may share your personal information with unaffiliated   companies to market, advertise, and promote products and services to you. This   includes persons and entities with whom we have entered into a joint marketing   agreement, where we together market either our products and services or those of   our marketing partner. We enter into contractual agreements with these companies   prohibiting them from disclosing or using our customer information other than to   carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. These companies   are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Protection of A‑dec and others:</strong></em> We may disclose   your information, including personally identifiable information, in special   cases when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a)   conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal process such as, but not   limited to situations when we are required to do so by federal, state or local   laws and regulations or when we receive a subpoena or are ordered by a court to   do so; (b) protect and defend our rights; or (c) act to protect the rights,   property, and other interests of our users or others. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Business transfers:</strong></em> As we continue to develop our   business, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. In these   transactions, customer information generally is one of the assets transferred   but it remains subject to the restrictions set forth in any pre-existing privacy   policy. Also, in the event that A‑dec is acquired by a third party, customer   information would likely be one of the acquired assets. </p>
          <p><em><strong>Other parties:</strong></em> While our contracts with third   parties limit their use of personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee   that every third party will comply with these obligations. It is possible that   such a third party could breach its obligation and use your personal information   in a way contrary to our policy. Also, this website contains links to other   sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these   other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read   the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit. </p>
          <p><strong>4. Security</strong><br>
            A‑dec strives to protect the information   provided by our users and customers. All of our collected information is stored   behind a secured firewall which restricts access from third parties. Additionally, the servers that store your personally identifiable information are housed in a secure environment. We also make an effort to protect your information off-line. Only personnel who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service   representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Despite   these precautions, given the nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures are not infallible, we cannot guarantee the security of your   information. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. </p>
          <p>When registering for access to a secure area of the site, we will ask you to select a username and password. We recommend that you do not divulge your   password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also, remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence when accessing your computer.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Correcting, Updating, Deleting and Deactivating Personal Information</strong><br>
            You have the right to access your personal information collected by us. If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct, update or delete our record of your personally identifiable information. Simply send email to [customerservice@a‑dec.com] or call Customer Service at 1.800.547.1883.</p>
          <p><strong>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
            We may, from time to time, update this Privacy Policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your personal information by sending a notice to your designated email address or by placing a prominent notice on our website. You will also be given the choice as to whether or not we may use your information in this different manner. </p>
          <p><strong>7. Contact Information</strong><br>
            If you have any questions about our privacy policy or if you feel that your information has been used or disclosed in violation of this policy, please contact us at:</p>
