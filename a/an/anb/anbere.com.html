                                we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing
                                of the applicable data as described below.</p>

                                    the data is accurate;</li>
                                <li>We wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want

                                <li>We no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing but you require us

                                provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding
