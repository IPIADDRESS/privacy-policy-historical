                <li class="unit numberedunit">In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data
                    protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our
                    summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory
                    authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

                <li class="unit numberedunit">Your principal rights under data protection law are:

                </li>
                <li class="unit numberedunit">You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your
                    personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional
                    information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the
                    categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights
                    and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
                    first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable
                    fee.
                </li>
                <li class="unit numberedunit">You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you

                </li>
                <li class="unit numberedunit">In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal

                    relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent
                    to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data
                    protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been
                    unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions
                    include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
                    information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence
                    of legal claims.
                </li>
                <li class="unit numberedunit">In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of
                    your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data;
                    processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes
                    of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
                    claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where
                    processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However,
                    we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                    legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of
                    important public interest.

                <li class="unit numberedunit">You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on
                    grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the
                    processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the
                    public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
                    legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease
                    to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
                    processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
                    establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

                <li class="unit numberedunit">To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal

                <li class="unit numberedunit">If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes
