    <strong>AND CO collects Your Personal Information:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO is a provider of online back office service designed for freelancers
    and small businesses, including online accounting and finance management

    and professional referral services. The information we gather enables us to

    with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or
    display some of your Personal Information. “Personal Information” is
    information about an identifiable individual, and may include information
    such as the individual’s name, email address, telephone number, bank
    account details, taxation details, and accounting and financial
    information. AND CO may collect Personal Information directly from You when
    You:
  </p>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can always choose not to provide Your Personal Information to AND CO,
    but it may mean that we are unable to provide You with the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      AND CO may receive Personal Information from You about others:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Through Your use of the Services, AND CO may also collect information from
    You about someone else. If You provide AND CO with Personal Information
    about someone else, You warrant and represent that You are authorized to
    disclose that information to AND CO and that AND CO may collect, use and
    disclose such information for the purposes described in this Privacy
    Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual
    concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in
    this Privacy Policy, including the fact that their Personal Information is
    being collected, the purposes for which that information is being
    collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's
    right to obtain access to that information, AND CO’s identity, and how to
    contact AND CO.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where requested to do so by AND CO, You must also assist AND CO with any
    requests by the individual to access or update the Personal Information You
    have collected from them and entered into the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      AND CO collects, holds, and uses Your Personal Information for limited
      purposes:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO collects Your Personal Information so that we can provide You with
    the Services. In doing so, AND CO may use the Personal Information we have
    collected from You for purposes related to the Services, including but not
    limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      verify Your identity,
    </li>
    <li>
      administer the Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      notify You of new or changed services offered in relation to the
      Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      carry out marketing or training relating to the Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      assist with the resolution of technical support issues or other issues
      relating to the Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      comply with applicable rules, laws and regulations, and
    </li>
    <li>
      communicate with You.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By using the Services, You consent to Your Personal Information being
    collected, held and used in this way and for any other use You authorize.
    AND CO will only use Your Personal Information for the purposes described
    in this Policy or in accordance with Your express consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that we do not collect financial information, such as your bank
    account or credit card number, credit card type and expiration date, and
    other such information (“Financial Information”). When You register for
    your Account or pay Your invoices, Your Financial Information is collected
    and stored by our Payment Processor. Currently, AND CO’s Payment Processor
    for payments for use of the Services is Stripe (https://stripe.com). If you
    use Stripe, you agree to the Stripe terms of service (located at
    https://stripe.com/payment-terms/legal) and privacy policy (located at
    https://stripe.com/us/privacy).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      AND CO may aggregate Your non-personally identifiable data:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    By using the Services, You agree that AND CO may access, aggregate and use
    non-personally identifiable data AND CO has collected from You
    (“Non-Personal Information”). AND CO may share Non-Personal information
    with its partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct
    business (“<u>Business Partners</u>”). Non-Personal information includes
    information that is (i) not Personal Information or (ii) derived from
    Personal Information but has been anonymized so that it is no longer
    personally identifiable. We use and share this type of data so that we and
    our Business Partners can understand how and how often people use our and
    their services or websites, which facilitates improving our Services, their
    services and how our Services interface with their services. In addition,
    these Business Partners may share with us non-private, aggregated or
    otherwise Non-Personal Information about You that they have independently
    developed or acquired.
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO may use Non-Personal Information to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assist us to better understand how our customers are using the
      Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and
      benefits of the Services,
    </li>
    <li>
      enhance freelancer’s productivity, including by creating useful
      business insights from that aggregated data and allowing You to
      benchmark Your business’ performance against that aggregated data, and
    </li>
    <li>
      otherwise to improve the Services.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>AND CO Servers:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    All Data, including Personal and Non-Personal Information, that is entered
    into the Services by You, or automatically imported on Your instruction, is
    transferred to AND CO’s servers as a function of transmission across the
    Internet. By using the Services, You consent to Your Personal Information
    being transferred to our servers as set out in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    You should review our Privacy Policy regularly to keep informed of any
    updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>AND CO takes steps to protect your personal information:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO is committed to protecting the security of Your Personal Information
    and we take all reasonable, industry-standard precautions to protect it
    from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. Your Personal
    Information is stored on secure servers and all Data transferred between
    You and the Services is encrypted. However, the Internet is not in itself a
    secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your
    Personal Information will be secure at all times. Transmission of Personal
    Information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only
    input, or instruct the inputting of, Personal Information to the Services
    within a secure environment. You are responsible for preventing
    unauthorized access to Your account and Personal Information, including,
    for example, by protecting Your account credentials and limiting access to
    devices on which You access the Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will advise You as soon as reasonably possible, and in accordance with
    applicable laws, upon discovering or being advised of a security breach
    where Your Personal Information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed,
    copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorized persons or in any
    unauthorized manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      AND CO only discloses Your Personal Information in limited
      circumstances:
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO will only disclose the Personal Information You have provided to us
    to entities outside the AND CO group of companies if it is necessary and
    appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your Personal Information
    was collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including the provision of
    the Services. AND CO will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information
    to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However,
    notwithstanding the foregoing, AND CO does reserve the right to access,
    read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is
    necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
    governmental request; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
    Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii)
    detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
    (iv) respond to user support requests or (v) protect our rights, property
    or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information
    with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
    spam/malware prevention. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You
    if we are required by law to disclose Your Personal Information.
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO may employ and contract with people and other entities that perform
    certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “<u>Agents</u>”).
    We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to
    provide the Services to You. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do
    not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we
    share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent
    to our sharing of Your Personal Information with our Agents.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, AND CO may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of
    transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business
    assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired,
    or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be
    one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
    acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or
    our assets may continue to use Your Personal Information as set forth in
    this policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>You may request access to Your Personal Information:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    It is Your responsibility to ensure that the Personal Information You
    provide to us is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may request access
    to the Personal Information we hold about You, or request that we update or
    correct any Personal Information we hold about You, by setting out Your
    request in writing and sending it to us at <a href="mailto:hello@andco.nyc">hello@andco.nyc</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    AND CO will process Your request as soon as reasonably practicable,
    provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so on legal grounds. If
    we are unable to meet Your request, we will let you know why. In some
    circumstances, it may be necessary for us to seek to arrange access to Your
    Personal Information through a mutually agreed intermediary (for example,
    the Subscriber).
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ll only keep Your Personal Information for as long as we require it for
    the purposes of providing You with the Services. However, we may also be
    required to keep some of Your Personal Information for specified periods of
    time, for example under certain laws relating to corporations, money
    laundering, and financial reporting legislation.
  </p>
  <p>

    subscribed. You may need to send separate requests to be removed from each
    specific mailing list to which You are subscribed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>

    practices of such third parties that we do not own or control. While we
    attempt to facilitate access only to those third-party websites, services,
    and applications that share our respect for your privacy, AND CO has no
    control over, and takes no responsibility for, the privacy practices or
    content of these websites, services, and applications. You are responsible
    for checking the privacy policy of any such applications so that You can be
    informed of how they will handle Your Personal Information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>This policy may be updated from time to time:</strong>
