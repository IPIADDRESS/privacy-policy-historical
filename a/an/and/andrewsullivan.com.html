<font class="artsectionhead">Privacy Policy for <i>Atlantic Online</i> and <i>Atlantic Reader Panel</i></font><br><br>

We want you to enjoy and benefit from our Web site and the Atlantic Online Reader Panel secure in the knowledge that we have taken steps to implement fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. The following explains what information we collect about you and how we use it. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead"></font><p><font class="artsectionhead">What We Learn</font> <br>
This Web site automatically recognizes your domain name, IP address, browser version, operating system and the site you passed through to reach us. In addition, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to <i>The Atlantic Online</i> and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell how many people tuned in to a program. If you choose to give us your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, organization, or any other identifying information, unless such information is provided in the course of subscribing to <i>The</i> <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine, it will be used only to provide you with products or services you have requested or additional information about <i>Atlantic Online</i> or its affiliates. Information gathered through the use of cookies is not related to any personally identifiable details. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">How We Use What We Learn </font><br>
The information we collect is used to improve the content of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine and our Web site and to help develop new products. Also, we compile and use this information so that we may keep you apprised of special offers and new products that may be of interest to you.  <br>
<br>
We may use a user's personally identifiable information for editorial purposes, such as to contact you as part of an online survey.  Additionally, we may use the information provided by you to: 1) contact you in order to comply with any legal requirements, 2) advise you of any material changes or additions to our service, 3) advise you of account status and 4) inform you of additional products and services, special and exclusive offers. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">What We Tell Others About You</font> <br>
We will not sell or rent or willfully disclose any personally identifying information obtained through this Web site (other than in connection with magazine subscriptions ordered, as explained below) to a party outside Atlantic Media Company, its divisions, its vendors providing Internet hosting services or third party list managers, without first receiving the user's permission. We do not collect personally identifying information from our visitors, other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis. For <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> print subscribers, from time to time we make our subscribers' names and addresses available to reputable companies whose products or services we feel may interest you. Many of our subscribers find this a valuable and time-saving service. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by e-mailing, calling or writing us (see addresses below).<br><br>
We may provide statistical usage data in the aggregate — not information about you personally — to our partners about how visitors use this Web Site.  From time to time we conduct research on our users' demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us upon registration, on order forms, as well as from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis and we may share this aggregated data with advertisers or other businesses. And in some cases, we may be required by law to disclose information about you to a third party.<br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">What Are Cookies And How Do We Use Them?</font><br>
This Web site places a "cookie" on the browser of a user's computer to gather and store basic tracking information and to monitor the presentation of advertisements.  We may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns.  For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session.  Cookies are also used to restrict access to bona fide subscribers and to enable you to set up customized alerts that no other subscribers are permitted to see.  Cookies are not related to any personally identifiable information and are not used to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.<br><br>
Advertising service vendors that serve ads into our site may also use their own cookies. You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by this Web site by changing the setting on your browser.  Some browsers are set to refuse all cookies, or to restrict the conditions under which they are set.  Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by us. For more information about setting your browser to opt-out of cookies, please <a href="/a/techfaq.mhtml#cookie">click here</a>.  <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Advertisers and Links</font><br>
This site contains links to other sites, including those produced by other organizations.  Additionally, our advertisers, or Web sites that have links on our site, may also collect personally identifiable information directly from you. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or contents of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access. Please visit the sites of these businesses to review their privacy policies. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Kids</font><br>
Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, over the Internet, to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online. <br>
<br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Parents</font><br>
We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personally identifiable information collected by us that we are aware is from children will be used only for our internal purposes such as market research, sweepstakes fulfillment or for fulfilling requests for information or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. Such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without your prior consent. Anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other parties with which we do business, for statistical and market research purposes as described above. Finally you should be aware that if your children voluntarily disclose information such as their names or e-mail addresses on various forums or chat areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Data Security</font><br>
We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet. <br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Disclaimer</font><br>
This Privacy Policy may be changed at any time at our discretion.<br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">How Can I Request that my Personally Identifiable Information not be Shared?  How Can I Review My Personally Identifiable Information?</font><br>
As indicated above, if you do not want your personally identifiable information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by e-mailing, calling or writing us (see addresses below).  Similarly, please contact us at the same addresses if at any time you wish to review your personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<font class="artsectionhead">Any Questions?</font> <br>
For more information on our Privacy Policy, or if at any time you wish to discontinue receiving communications from us that do not directly pertain to your subscription, please let us know by emailing us at service@theatlantic.com, calling us at 800-234-2411 or writing to us at the address listed below. <br><br>
