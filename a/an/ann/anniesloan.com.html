<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data&nbsp;where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>
<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you, outlined in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity Data&nbsp;including first name, last name, title. Your image and car number plate may be recorded on CCTV in Annie Sloan Headquarters.</li>

</ul>
<p>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not&nbsp;considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of&nbsp;users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat&nbsp;the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual&nbsp;orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal&nbsp;convictions and offences.<br><br>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to&nbsp;perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service&nbsp;you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
<hr>
<h4><span><a name="howandwhywecollect"></a>How and why do we use your personal data?</span></h4>
<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where&nbsp;we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or&nbsp;have entered into with you.</li>
<li>Where&nbsp;it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a&nbsp;third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override&nbsp;those interests.</li>
<li>Where&nbsp;we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
<ul>
<li>Legitimate&nbsp;Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and&nbsp;managing our business to enable us to give you the&nbsp;best service/product&nbsp;and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and&nbsp;balance any potential impact&nbsp;on you (both positive and negative) and your&nbsp;rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.&nbsp;We do not&nbsp;use your personal data for activities where our interests are&nbsp;overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or&nbsp;are&nbsp;otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further&nbsp;information about how we assess our legitimate interests&nbsp;against any&nbsp;potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting&nbsp;us.</li>
<li>Performance&nbsp;of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the&nbsp;performance of a contract to which you are&nbsp;a party or to take steps at&nbsp;your request before entering into such a contract.</li>
<li>Comply&nbsp;with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your&nbsp;personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a&nbsp;legal or&nbsp;regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</li>
</ul>
<li>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal&nbsp;basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third&nbsp;party&nbsp;direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.</li>
<li>Examples of how we use information held about you include:</li>
<ul>
<li>To&nbsp;process any orders that you make on our website or&nbsp;in our shop “The Annie Sloan Shop”. If we don't&nbsp;collect your personal data during checkout, we won't be&nbsp;able to process&nbsp;and deliver your order and comply with legal obligations. For example,&nbsp;your details may need to be passed to a third&nbsp;party to supply or deliver&nbsp;the product or service that you ordered, and we may keep your details for&nbsp;a reasonable period afterwards in&nbsp;order to fulfil any contractual&nbsp;obligations such as refunds, guarantees and so on.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the&nbsp;information you send enables us to respond. We may also&nbsp;keep a record of&nbsp;these to inform any future communication with us and to demonstrate how we&nbsp;communicated with you throughout.&nbsp;We do this on the basis of our&nbsp;contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate&nbsp;interests in providing you with&nbsp;the best service and understanding how we&nbsp;can improve our service based on your experience.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;protect our customers, premises, assets and staff from crime, we operate&nbsp;CCTV systems in our Headquarters&nbsp;which record&nbsp;images for security.&nbsp;We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the&nbsp;basis of our legitimate business interests. This also&nbsp;helps to protect our&nbsp;customers from fraud.</li>
<li>If&nbsp;we discover any criminal activity or alleged criminal activity through our&nbsp;use of CCTV, fraud monitoring and suspicious transaction&nbsp;monitoring, we&nbsp;will process this data for the purposes of preventing or detecting&nbsp;unlawful acts. We aim to protect the individuals we&nbsp;interact with from&nbsp;criminal activities.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;listen to recorded telephone conversations for internal staff training.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;send you relevant communications&nbsp;by email or post in relation to updates,&nbsp;products and services. We'll do this on the basis of our&nbsp;legitimate&nbsp;business interest. You are free to opt out of hearing from us by email or&nbsp;post at any time.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;administer any of our prize draws or competitions which you enter.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;develop, test and improve the systems, services and products we provide to&nbsp;you. We'll do this on the basis of our legitimate&nbsp;business interests.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;comply with our contractual or legal obligations to share data with law&nbsp;enforcement.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;send you survey and feedback requests to help improve our services. These&nbsp;messages will not include any promotional content&nbsp;and do not require prior&nbsp;consent when sent by email or text message. We have a legitimate interest&nbsp;to do so as this helps make our&nbsp;products or services more relevant to you.</li>
<li>To&nbsp;build a picture of who you are and your interests, and to inform our&nbsp;business decisions, we'll combine data captured by Annie Sloan, third&nbsp;parties and&nbsp;data from publicly-available lists.&nbsp;We'll do this on&nbsp;the basis of our&nbsp;legitimate business interest.&nbsp;</li>

<hr>
<h4><span><a name="yourrights"></a>What are your rights over your personal data?</span></h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under&nbsp;data protection laws in relation to your personal data.<br>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as&nbsp;a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy&nbsp;of the&nbsp;personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully&nbsp;processing it.</li>
<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold&nbsp;about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold&nbsp;about&nbsp;you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data&nbsp;you provide to us.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you&nbsp;to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for&nbsp;us&nbsp;continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or&nbsp;remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised&nbsp;your right to&nbsp;object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information&nbsp;unlawfully or where we are required to&nbsp;erase your personal data to comply with&nbsp;local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your&nbsp;request of erasure&nbsp;for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if&nbsp;applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are&nbsp;relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is&nbsp;something&nbsp;about your particular situation which makes you want to object to&nbsp;processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental&nbsp;rights and&nbsp;freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your&nbsp;personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some&nbsp;cases, we may demonstrate&nbsp;that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which&nbsp;override your rights and&nbsp;freedoms.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal&nbsp;data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal&nbsp;data in the&nbsp;following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's&nbsp;accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to&nbsp;erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require&nbsp;it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims;&nbsp;or (d) you&nbsp;have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have&nbsp;overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to&nbsp;a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note&nbsp;that this right only applies to automated information which you initially&nbsp;provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a&nbsp;contract with you.</li>
<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on&nbsp;consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the&nbsp;lawfulness&nbsp;of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If&nbsp;you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain&nbsp;products or&nbsp;services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you&nbsp;withdraw your consent.</li>
<li>In cases where we are processing your personal data on the&nbsp;basis of our legitimate interest, you can ask us to stop for reasons connected&nbsp;to your individual situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have a&nbsp;legitimate overriding reason to continue processing your&nbsp;personal data.</li>
<li>You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for&nbsp;direct marketing activity through all channels, or selected channels. We must&nbsp;always comply with your request.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above,&nbsp;please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@anniesloan.com">privacy@anniesloan.com</a>.<br><br>As an active exisitng subscriber we will continue to send you email marketing (our newsletter). To opt out from email marketing please click on the&nbsp;unsubscribe link featured at the bottom of each marketing email we send.<br><br>If we choose not to action your request we will explain to&nbsp;you the reasons for our refusal.<br><br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data&nbsp;(or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable&nbsp;fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.&nbsp;Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help&nbsp;us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data&nbsp;(or&nbsp;to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure&nbsp;that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no&nbsp;right to receive it.&nbsp;We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your&nbsp;request to speed up our response.<br><br>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one&nbsp;month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we&nbsp;will notify you and keep you updated.</p>			</div>
