<h2><strong>Changes and updates to the Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>From time to time, we may revise the Privacy Policy.  To help you stay current of any changes, we take the following two steps:  (i) we note the date the Privacy Policy was last updated above; (ii) when we make a change to the Privacy Policy, we post conspicuous announcement of such changes on the homepage of the Website on the Website next to the link to this Privacy Policy.  Your use of the Website following the posting of any revised Privacy Policy shall be deemed acceptance of the revised policy, so we strongly recommend that you check back the Privacy Policy periodically.  If, and only if, we make revisions to the Privacy Policy that result in a material lessening of the restrictions on our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will make a commercially reasonable attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the terms of any Privacy Policy at any time, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of the Website and inform us of such termination as described in Privacy Policy.  Continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to any Privacy Policy as in effect.</p>
<h2><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></h2>
<p>If any part of the Privacy Policy is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Privacy Policy shall continue in force and effect.</p>
