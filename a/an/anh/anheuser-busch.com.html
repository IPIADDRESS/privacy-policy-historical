<strong>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
We may disclose the information we collect from and about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to:</li>
<li>identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, customers or other users of the Website, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities:</li>
<li>enforce the Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, investigate and defend against any third-party claims or allegations, and/or protect the security or integrity of the Website; or, respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws;</li>
<li>to our business partners for research, analytical and marketing purposes, and/or to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing any request on your behalf, provided, that such business partners are bound by obligations of confidentiality with respect to your information that are at least as restrictive as those imposed upon Anheuser-Busch by this privacy policy; or</li>
<li>otherwise with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may sell or buy other businesses or entities. In such event, we may transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such transactions, your Personal Information may be included in the transferred business assets.</p>
<p>Also, in the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or used and your Personal Information may be included in the transferred assets.</p>
<p>We may use your Usage Information to identify and develop products and services that may be of interest to you and/or share this information with certain third parties for direct marketing purposes with respect to special offers, products, services, programs, promotions, surveys, publications, invitations or other opportunities that may be of interest to certain demographic groups.</p>
<p>We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future.</p>
<p>Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may be entitled to request disclosure regarding how we share your Usage Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes (“Information-Sharing Disclosure”). To the extent required by applicable law, we shall provide the Information-Sharing Disclosure to you upon your written  request to Anheuser-Busch, Inc., One Busch Place, St. Louis, MO 63118.</p>
<p>Except as explained above, we will not share any of your personal information with any third party, unless we have received your express permission to do so.</p>

<strong>LINKED SITES</strong><br>
Our Website may contain links to other websites, including social media sites, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of information collected through third-party websites and expressly disclaim any liability related to such collection, use or disclosure. We are not responsible for any information or content contained on such sites. Links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience. Your browsing, use and interaction on any other websites, including websites which have a link to the Website, are subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Please review the privacy policy posted on any website that you may access through, or which links to the Website.</p>
<p>Please note that if you provide information to us via a social media site or participate in a social media site linked to the Website, you consent to our use of your information for any reason as if it were submitted to us directly via the Website.</p>
<p><a name="privacy-policy-12"></a><br>
<strong>SECURITY PROCEDURES</strong><br>
We take commercially reasonable precautions and have implemented commercially reasonable technical measures intended to protect against the risks of unauthorized access to, erroneous disclosure of, and unlawful interception of Personal Information submitted via the Website.  However, your email transmissions and/or other communications containing Personal Information may be unlawfully intercepted or accessed by third parties and/or the Website may be subject to hostile network attacks or administrative errors.  We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the Internet.  Once we receive your Personal Information, we take steps that we believe are commercially reasonable to limit access to your Personal Information to only those employees and service providers whom we determine need access to the Personal Information to provide the requested products, services, offers or opportunities that may be of interest to you.  However, even after we receive your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of our commercially reasonable efforts or as a result of any other event beyond our reasonable control.  Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that your Personal Information is completely secure and safe from such risks.  <strong>For the avoidance of doubt, WE expressly disclaim any representation or warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to ensuring, guaranteeing or otherwise offering any definitive promise of security in connection with your PERSONAL Information or Usage Information. </strong></p>

<strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS</strong><br>
The Website is hosted in the United States. If you are attempting to access the Website from a physical location within the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that your use of the Website is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and the Terms of Use.  To the extent you provide Personal Information through the Website, you are transferring your Personal Information to the United States and you consent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>such transfer,</li>
<li>the application of the laws of the United States and/or the State of Missouri with respect to any dispute arising from or related to the Privacy Policy and/or your use of the Website, other than such rules, regulations, case law, and/or international treaties that would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or the State of Missouri, and</li>
<li>the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Missouri and the federal courts sitting in St. Louis, Missouri.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any claim or dispute between you and us that arises from your use of the Website or in connection with the Privacy Policy shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.

<p><a name="privacy-policy-14"></a><br>
<strong>CHANGED AND UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
From time to time, we may revise the Privacy Policy. To help you stay current of any changes, we take the following two steps: (i) we note the date the Privacy Policy was last updated above; (ii) when we make a change to the Privacy Policy, we post conspicuous announcement of such changes on the homepage of the Website on the Website next to the link to this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Website following the posting of any revised Privacy Policy shall be deemed acceptance of the revised policy, so we strongly recommend that you review the Privacy Policy periodically. If, and only if, we make revisions to the Privacy Policy that result in a material lessening of the restrictions on our use or disclosure of your Personal Information, we will make a commercially reasonable attempt to obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such Personal Information. If you disagree with the terms of our Privacy Policy at any time, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of the Website and inform us of such termination as described in this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Website constitutes your agreement to the Privacy Policy  in effect.</p>
<p><a name="privacy-policy-15"></a><br>
<strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br>
If any part of the Privacy Policy is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Privacy Policy shall continue in force and effect.</p>
