<span class="c2">The Types of Information Answerbag Collects</span>
<span class="c0">. We collect any information you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Service. Our account registration process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create and provide us with a password. We may also request other information, such as but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.</span>
</li>
<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Information in Public Areas of the Site</span>
<span class="c0">. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas. Also, we may highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site's home page.</span>

<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Facebook</span>

<span class="c2">Cookies</span>
<span class="c0">. Like many websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser. Our cookies do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but they do collect other information such as the following:</span>

<span class="c2">Pixel Tags</span>
<span class="c0">. In our email to you, we use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve </span>
<span class="c14">bandwidth</span>
<span class="c0">).</span>

<span class="c2">Collection of Information by Third Parties</span>
<span class="c0">. Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content our Site use cookies on our Site and may place a cookie on your computer. The content posted by these businesses will be identified as coming from a third party. In addition, we use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies (1) use information obtained from your visits to this Site and other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party cookies on your browser. Also, we use web beacons provided by third party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer.

</li>
<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Use of Other Information</span>
<span class="c0">. We use non-PII about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Service more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.</span>

<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Retention of Information</span>
<span class="c0">. We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations.

<span class="c2">Advertisers and Others</span>
<span class="c0">. We share non-personally identifiable information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business.

</li>
<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Service Third Parties</span>
<span class="c0">. We contract with affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending Answerbag email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions.</span>
</li>
<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Business Transfer</span>
<span class="c0">. As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in acquisitions, merger, restructurings, changes or control, or similar transactions. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets, and your PII is subject to such a transfer. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.</span>
</li>
<li class="c10 c9">
<span class="c2">Affiliates</span>
<span class="c0">. We may share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates. Some of our most significant affiliates are identified on the website of our parent company, </span>
<span class="c14">Wired Ivy, LLC. &nbsp;</span>
<span class="c0">Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled entities may participate from time to time. Any use of your information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your privacy. Likewise, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates or from your visits to other web sites that we or our corporate affiliates control. We may share information about you with our corporate affiliates and our corporate affiliates may share information with us using cookie or any other available technology.</span>

<span class="c2">The Types of Information We Collect</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="c1 c9 c3">
<span class="c0">We use Facebook's OpenGraph API, so that you can use your existing Facebook.com account to access the features of the Site. You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c3 c9">
<span class="c0">You should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings determine what PII is made available to us when you access the Site. While the Facebook OpenGraph API allows us to access and store a host of information about you, we only access and store PII which we feel is useful to enhance your experience of the Site. When you first create an account with us through the Facebook OpenGraph API, we access and store your name, public "About Me" information, your email address, your Facebook user id number, and your Facebook URL. We also pull your friends list (their first and last names and Facebook user id numbers), but only keep a record of your connection to them if your friends have also created accounts with the Site. We do NOT store any data about any of your Facebook friends if they don't already have their own Site accounts. Each time you login to the Site we check your friends list from Facebook to see if any of your friends have signed up for the Site since you last visited so they can appear as part of your Answerbag network of friends.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c9 c3">
<span class="c0">Facebook also gives us access to your (and your friends') main profile photos, if those photos are public. We do not store those photos ourselves; rather, we serve them directly from Facebook's servers.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1 c9 c3">
<span class="c0">We may store your </span>

<span class="c2">Terminating your Account</span>
<span class="c0">. You may discontinue this service at any time by removing your Answerbag account under the "Applications and Websites" section of your Facebook Privacy Settings. This will remove all references to you and your data from display on Facebook, but will not affect your Facebook.com account.</span>

<span class="c0">. You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we generally will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.

<span class="c0">. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE SECURITY. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</span>
