                    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    
                          <p><span class="text16"><strong>Website
Visitors</strong></span><br>
Like most website operators, InboxQ collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
and the date and time of each visitor request. InboxQ's purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how InboxQ's visitors use its website. From time to time, InboxQ may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing
a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


  <p>InboxQ also collects potentially personally-identifying information
like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. InboxQ does not use such information
to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>

<p>Certain visitors to InboxQ's websites choose to interact with InboxQ in
ways that require InboxQ to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that InboxQ gathers depends on the nature of
the interaction.</p>

<p>At present we use Twitter as our identification provider. Any use of
Twitter on behalf of the individual is subject to the Twitter Terms of
Service and Twitter Privacy Policy.
InboxQ collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate
to fulfil the purpose of the visitor's interaction with InboxQ. InboxQ does
not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below. And visitors can always refuse to authenticate with Twitter, with the
caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
activities.</p>


  <p><span class="text16"><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></span><br>InboxQ may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to its
websites. InboxQ does not disclose personally-identifying information other
than as described below.
InboxQ uses Google Analytics, Chartbeat and Mixpanel to help collect
information about site usage. These services collect information sent by
your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP
address. Their usage of this information is governed by their privacy
policies.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>


<p>InboxQ discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that
information in order to process it on InboxQ's behalf or to provide services
available at InboxQ's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it
to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be
located outside of your home country; by using InboxQ's websites, you
consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>

<p>InboxQ will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
contractors, and affiliated organisations, as described above, InboxQ
discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only when required to do so by law, or when InboxQ believes in
good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
or rights of InboxQ, third parties, or the public at large.</p>

<p>If you are a registered user of a InboxQ website and have supplied your
email address, InboxQ may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
going on with InboxQ and our products. We primarily use our blog to
communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
us support other users. InboxQ will also send you transactional email that
you opted into, at the frequency you requested, you can unsubscribe from
these at any time. InboxQ reserves the right to introduce new types of
transactional mail which you can then change the frequency of or unsubscribe
if you so choose.</p>

<p>InboxQ would like to reassure you that we will be respectable with the
permissions you grant us with your Twitter authentication. We will never
access your direct messages stored against your Twitter account. We will
never post to Twitter without your explicit permission for us to do so.</p>

<p>InboxQ takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>



  <p><span class="text16"><strong>Cookies</strong></span><br>A cookie is
a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and
that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor
returns. InboxQ uses cookies to help InboxQ identify and track visitors,
their usage of InboxQ website, and their website access preferences.
</p>

<p>InboxQ visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using InboxQ's websites,
with the drawback that certain features of InboxQ's websites may not
function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>


  <p><span class="text16"><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></span><br>Although most changes are likely to be minor, InboxQ may change its
Privacy Policy from time to time, and at InboxQ's sole discretion. InboxQ
encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
