				<br>
			</p>
			
			
			<p class="body"><a name="Personal"></a>Privacy Information for Ancestry.com.au ("Website")</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				By accessing the Website you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement in addition to the Terms and Conditions which define your rights, 
				responsibilities and obligations with respect to your use of the Website. You consent to our use, collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. We may amend, edit or update this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make any material changes we will notify you by way of a prominent notice on the Website announcing such changes.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Ancestry.com Operations Inc., operator of the Website (and referred to as 'Ancestry.com' 'Ancestry' 'we' 'us' 'our'), recognises the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are committed to respecting and upholding your rights to privacy protection. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website. 
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Overview</strong><br>
				The personal, private information that is provided to us by individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties save where necessary 
				to perform the functions of this Website; where the terms have been breached; where required by law; or as otherwise set out below.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				The Website is owned and operated by Ancestry.com Operations Inc., a Delaware corporation located in the United States of America. You understand and acknowledge that by accessing this Website, your personal information may be transferred, processed and stored outside of Australia. Ancestry may use related entities or other third parties (whether within or outside of Australia) to process the data.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				The specifics of our use of personal information are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Do you ask for personal information from your members?</strong><br>
				Yes.  We ask for your name, e-mail address when you sign up as a member and when you use features such 
				as e-mail. In addition we will need to know your postal address when you choose 
				to take out a subscription with us or when you make purchases from us. Much of this information may be entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar information 
				at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by us and/or one of our partners.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				To facilitate payment and fulfillment in connection with membership and other purchases from us, we will request personal credit card, debit 
				card or other payment information.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				As an Ancestry member you can also choose to share further information about yourself, your background and interests with other members. The amount and type of profile information you share in this way is entirely your choice. Information about some of your activity on the site, such as historical records you save, may also be shared with other members in order to help you connect with others researching similar ancestors. See 
				'<a href="#Profiles">Member Profiles</a>' below for more information on how you can edit or control what 
				you allow other members to see about you and your site activity in your public profile or other places on the site.</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>How do you collect and use my personal information?</strong></p>
			<p class="body">
				We usually collect personal information about you when you submit 
				content through the Website or where you contact us by email or otherwise</p>
			<p class="body">
				Where practical we will collect your personal information from 
				you directly. However, as well as collecting personal information directly from 
				you, we may also collect your personal information from a third party. For 
				example, other members may upload personal information about you (e.g. date of 
				birth, etc) to the Website through their family tree or through other content 
				submissions. While we advise our members to be sensitive to privacy issues and 
				obtain consents and permissions where necessary, we have no control over the 
				content of these posts. If personal information appears on the Website without 
				your permission please contact us at the contact address below and we will work 
				toward resolving the issue.</p>
			<p class="body">The primary use of your personal information, other than directly in connection with a purchase, is to efficiently provide you with personalized, relevant information.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				We will also use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from us and to address customer service needs and requests.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser is not given access to individual account information. We do not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these advertisers. Advertisers simply provide the advertising message and we then display the ad to appropriate users.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Will you disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</strong><br>
				We will not disclose your personal information provided in connection with membership registration or purchases, except with your knowledge and consent as described in 
				(a) this Privacy Statement or (b) where personal information is collected 
				through the Website or (c) as may be required by law, or to protect our rights or property.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Information submitted by you online (such as information about products you purchase from us, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with companies with which we have a commercial relationship and through which you reached 
				the Website, for marketing purposes. For example, if you make a purchase with us because of a special offer made through another site acting as a distributor of our products, in that circumstance you will be considered their customer as well. If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request.  We will not, except as may be required by law, share with any other party your password or payment information.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Other circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in 
				aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors, partners and 
				advertisers but these statistics will include no personally identifying 
				information.
				We reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "47% of our users have attended college" in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of confidentiality agreements, Ancestry may match common user information, such as name, address and phone number with third party data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>What about purchases from advertisers or other linked sites?</strong><br>
				If you click away from the Website to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be used.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Will Ancestry use my information for direct mailings?</strong><br>
				We will send electronic mail or other mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of changes or additions to 
				the Website, or of any Ancestry.com or Ancestry related products and services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail or at your preferences page.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>May I refuse to provide personal information to you or to accept advertising?</strong><br>
				Visitors may access the Website free services by providing a first name, last name, and 
				e-mail address or other information that we may deem appropriate to that 
				purpose. To gain full access to the members-only areas, a username, e-mail 
				address and appropriate billing information are required. Because the Website is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on 
				the Website pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Family information</strong><br>
				Where you choose to invite other family members to view and edit your family 
				tree, we will ask you for the family member's e-mail address. You must first 
				make certain that you have obtained the consent of the family member to the 
				passing of their details by you to Ancestry. Ancestry will only use this 
				information for the purpose of contacting the relative with their access details 
				and will not use the information for marketing purposes. In addition you should 
				also make sure that information or material you wish to place on the site about 
				your living relatives is only posted with their prior knowledge and consent.</p>
			<p class="body"><a name="Cookies"></a><strong>Do you use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</strong><br><strong>IP Addresses:</strong><br>
				We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members and may be used to “geolocate” our members to allow us to provide services appropriate to your place of residence.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Cookies:</strong><br>
				Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time you return. We may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For instance, we may use cookies to retain your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Advertiser Cookies:</strong><br>
				We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>When do you distribute or publish information on the living on your Sites?</strong><br>
				Posts contributed by our members to message boards and other community areas may include information on the living. While we advise our members to be sensitive to privacy issues, we have no control over the content of these posts. If such a post violates our Terms and Conditions, you may notify us at <a href="mailto:abuse@ancestry.com">“report abuse”</a> and we will help work toward resolving the issue.

				We do republish databases that contain published information on the living, such as white pages, people finder directories and some birth, death and marriage records.  The information in these databases has been gathered from public records released by governmental and other agencies, and is available elsewhere, often on the Internet.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>What else should I know about privacy?</strong><br>
				The following details a few key issues mentioned in context above:
			</p>
			<p class="body"><a name="Profiles"></a><strong>Member Profiles</strong><br>
				You may provide information about yourself to the community and other areas of our sites, but only at your option. If provided in a public community area, the data is, of course, public. Participation in public areas and community services is at your discretion.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Your Public Profile</strong><br>
				When you sign-up as a member you are provided with a public member profile 
				pre-populated with your chosen username. Your user name and location will be 
				displayed on the site when you post, comment or interact with other 
				Ancestry members. If you want additional privacy you can edit your 
				username within your public profile to one that does not include any personally 
				identifiable information. You can also enhance your public profile to provide 
				additional information about yourself. Any information including any sensitive 
				personal information that is disclosed in this area becomes public and you 
				should therefore exercise caution when deciding what personal information you 
				choose to disclose. You can customize your settings about how other members can 
				contact you as well as what displays on your Public Profile. If you do not do 
				this then the default setting is that the information within your Public Profile 
				and also certain elements of your recent activity on the site will be publicly 
				accessible by other members. To edit your preferences <a href="http://www.Ancestry.com.au/myancestry/myaccount/communityprefs.aspx">click here</a></p>
			<p class="body">Through the <a href="http://www.Ancestry.com.au/myancestry/myaccount/communityprefs.aspx">Community Preferences</a> link in the Ancestry '<a href="http://www.Ancestry.com.au/myancestry/myaccount/default.aspx">My Account</a>' 
				section of the site, you can choose either to display your e-mail address with 
				other members or ensure that your e-mail is withheld so that you are only 
				contacted anonymously through the Ancestry Connection Service. You can also 
				control when you are contacted or block certain people from contacting you.</p>
			<p class="body">You can also customize what other members can learn about your Ancestry site activity.  To help you connect with other members researching similar ancestors, by default new accounts are set up to allow other members to learn about things you publicly add or post to the site, as well as some personal research activities (such as saving historical records to your Shoebox or private member tree).  To customize these settings, simply go to the “Activity Preferences” link on the Community Preferences page</p>
			<p class="body"><a name="Contests"></a><strong>Contests &amp; Promotions</strong><br>
				We may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. The participant’s contact information is also used to contact him or her when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Public forums - Ancestry Community</strong><br>
				This site makes forums, message boards and/or newsgroups available to its 
				members. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public 
				information and you should take care when deciding what personal information to 
				disclose to others.</p>
			<p class="body"><strong>Protection of my personal information</strong><br>
				We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of 
				your personal information. We use a variety of physical and electronic measures 
				to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss, unauthorised use or 
				disclosure.</p>
			<p class="body"><a name="Contests"></a><strong>Can I access and request correction 
				of my personal information?</strong><br>
				Yes, you can gain access to your personal information held by us by contacting 
				us at <a href="mailto:support@ancestry.com">support@ancestry.com</a>, or write 
				to us at the address below. If we refuse to provide you with access to the 
				information, we will provide you with valid reasons for the refusal.
			</p>
			<p class="body">If you believe that personal information that we hold about you is 
				incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may contact us and request amendment of it.
