          for Ancestry.com </span><br>
                Ancestry.com Statement of Privacy: Ancestry.com recognizes the 
                confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members 
                in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are 
                firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses 
                our information gathering and dissemination practices for this 
                site. </p>
        <p class="body"><b>Overview:</b><br>
          The personal, private information that is provided to Ancestry.com by 
          individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except 
          in rare cases involving possible violations of our use policies or legal 
          statutes. We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, 
          that is used to fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better 
          meet the needs of our users.</p>
        <p class="body"> Information submitted by you online (such as products 
          you purchase from Ancestry.com, your name, address, e-mail address) 
          may be shared with companies with which Ancestry.com has a commerce 
          relationship and through which you reached this site, for marketing 
          purposes. In such circumstances you will be considered their customer 
          as well. If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. 
          Under no circumstances will Ancestry.com share with any other party 
          your password or other personal information it may acquire about children, 
          family, etc.</p>
        <p class="body"> Demographic information collected through on-site user 
          surveys may be used in aggregate statistical form to attract potential 
          sponsors.</p>
        <p class="body"> The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described 
          in the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Does Ancestry.com ask for personal information?</b><br>
          Yes. Ancestry.com asks for your name, e-mail address, and other limited 
          personal information when you sign up as a member and use features such 
          as e-mail, and make purchases at the Ancestry.com online store. Most 
          of this information may be entered at your discretion. We may ask for 
          similar information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes 
          or other promotions sponsored by Ancestry.com and/or our many partners.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>How Does Ancestry.com use my personal information?</b><br>
          Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly 
          Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information 
          is to efficiently provide you with relevant information.</p>
        <p class="body"> Ancestry.com will also use registration information to 
          let you know about new features or other offers of interest from Ancestry.com, 
          or to address customer service needs and requests. </p>
        <p class="body">In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, <b>the 
          advertiser never has access to individual account information. Ancestry.com 
          does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information 
          you provide us to these advertisers.</b> Advertisers simply provide 
          an insertion order for the advertising message and Ancestry.com then 
          displays the ad to appropriate users based on the criteria specified 
          in the order.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Does Ancestry.com request or require any personal 
          financial information?</b><br>
          To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and purchases at 
          the Ancestry.com Online Store, Ancestry.com will request personal credit 
          card or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other 
          value-added family services that may be offered by Ancestry.com in the 
          future, users may be required to supply financial information.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Will Ancestry.com disclose any of my personal information 
          to third parties?</b><br>
          Ancestry.com will not disclose any of your personal information, except 
          with your knowledge and consent as described in this policy or as may 
          be required by law, or to protect the rights or property of Ancestry.com.</p>
        <p class="body"> Circumstances where limited personal information may 
          be disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, 
          such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other 
          promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any, information you 
          disclose.</p>
        <p class="body"> Ancestry.com reserves the right to disclose aggregated 
          user statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "47% of our 
          users earn $50,000 or more per year" in order to describe our services 
          to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under 
          protection of confidentiality agreements, Ancestry.com may match common 
          user information, such as name, address and phone number with third 
          party data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.</p>
        <p class="body"> Additionally, if you click away from Ancestry.com to 
          visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be 
          asked for your credit card or other personal information in order to 
          purchase or use products and services offered. These companies have 
          their own privacy and data collection practices. Ancestry.com has no 
          responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should 
          therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns 
          about how your information may be used.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Will Ancestry.com use my information for direct mailings?</b><br>
          Only at your option. Ancestry.com will occasionally send e-mail messages 
          to advise members when new information has been posted to the Web site 
          or to announce special product and service offerings that we feel may 
          be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such mailings, 
          you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in 
          the e-mail.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>May I refuse to provide personal information to Ancestry.com 
          or to accept advertising?</b><br>
          Yes and No. Visitors may access Ancestry.com’s free services without 
          providing any personal information. To gain full access to the members-only 
          areas, a username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information 
          are required. Because the Ancestry.com site is partially advertiser 
          supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising that appears on Ancestry.com 
          pages, but you may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b><a name="Cookies"></a>Does Ancestry.com use "IP Addresses" 
          and cookies?</b><br>
          IP Addresses: We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with 
          our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also 
          used to gather broad demographic information such as geographic distribution 
          of our members.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Ancestry.com Cookies:</b><br>
          Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal 
          information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information 
          you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are 
          tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register 
          at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who 
          you are each time you return. Ancestry.com may make limited use of cookies 
          to deliver content specific to your interests. For instance they may 
          be used to retain your personal preferences, hold session information 
          for a "shopping basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to 
          be re-entered each time you login.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Advertiser Cookies:<br>
          </b> Ancestry.com does post third party advertising banners on personal 
          family Web sites and on Ancestry.com general use pages. These ads may 
          contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about 
          where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts 
          of our Web site as explained above, cookies received with banner ads 
          may or may not be collected by our company or be under our control.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>Are Chat room dialogues recorded and saved?</b><br>
          Chat is not currently offered at Ancestry.com but will be in the future. 
          Dialogues will NOT be collected, stored, or used by the company or others.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b>What else should I know about privacy?</b><br>
          The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above. 
        </p>
        <p class="body"><b><a name="Profiles"></a>Member Profiles</b><br>
          Demographic data is collected at our site at the users’ option. This 
          information may include age and gender and other personal preferences 
          that can be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing Ancestry.com to 
          advertisers and others. In no case is personal information given or 
          sold to third parties. Ancestry.com controls the distribution of ALL 
          information at the site.</p>
        <p class="body"> <b><a name="Contests"></a>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>
          Ancestry.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions 
          on our site in which we ask members or visitors for contact information 
          (like an e-mail address) or demographic information (like a zip code, 
          age, or income level). We use this data to send users promotional material 
          about our company or our partners. The customer's contact information 
          is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared 
          with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with your prior 
          permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you take 
          part in the promotion. At any time, users may opt-out of receiving future 
          mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.</p>
