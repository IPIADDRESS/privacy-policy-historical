          are best described in the answers to the following Frequently Asked 
          Questions:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Does Ancestry.com ask for personal 
          information?<br>

          personal information when you sign up as a member and use features such 
          as e-mail, and make purchases at the Ancestry.com online store. Most 
          of this information may be entered at your option. We may ask for similar 
          information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other 
          promotion sponsored by Ancestry.com and/or our many partners.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>How Does Ancestry.com use my 
          personal information?<br>
          </b>Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, 
          user-friendly Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal 
          information is to efficiently provide you with relevant information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">Ancestry.com will also use registration 
          information let you know about new features or other offers of interest 
          from Ancestry.com, or to address customer service needs and requests.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">In distributing advertiser or sponsor 
          messages,<b> the advertiser never has access to individual account information. 
          Ancestry.com does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal 
          information you provide us </b></font><font face="geneva, arial"><b><font color="red" size="2">to 
          these advertisers</font><font size="2">. </font></b><font size="2">Advertisers 
          simply provide an insertion order for the advertising message and Ancestry.com 
          then displays the ad to appropriate users based on the criteria specified 
          in the order.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Does Ancestry.com request or 
          require any personal financial information?<br>
          </b>To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and purchases 
          at the Ancestry.com Online Store, Ancestry.com will request personal 
          credit card or debit card information. In order to take advantage of 
          other value-added family services that may be offered by Ancestry.com 
          in the future, users may be required to supply financial information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Will Ancestry.com disclose any 
          of my personal information to third parties?<br>
          </b>Ancestry.com will <i>not </i>disclose any of your personal information, 
          except with your knowledge and consent as described </font><font color="red" size="2" face="geneva, arial">in 
          this policy</font><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"> or as may be 
          required by law, or to protect the rights or property of Ancestry.com.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">Circumstances where limited personal 
          information may be disclosed are specifically described when the data 
          is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes 
          or other promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any information 
          you disclose.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">Ancestry.com reserves the right 
          to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of our users 
          are female" or "47% earn $50,000 or more per year" in 
          order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, 
          and other third parties. </font><font color="red" size="2" face="geneva, arial">Under 
          protection of confidentiality agreements, Ancestry.com may match common 
          user information, such as name, address &amp; phone number, with third 
          party data to avoid duplication and prevent errors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">Additionally, if you click away 
          from Ancestry.com to visit the site of any third party advertiser or 
          sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other personal information 
          in order </font><font color="red" size="2" face="geneva, arial">to</font><font size="2" face="geneva, arial">

          their own privacy and data collection practices. Ancestry.com has no 
          responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should 
          therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns 
          about how your information may be used.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Will Ancestry.com use my information 
          for direct mailings?<br>
          </b>Only at your option. Ancestry.com will occasionally send email messages 
          to advise members when new information has been posted to the Web site 
          or to announce special product and service offerings that we feel may 
          be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such mailings,

          information to Ancestry.com or to accept advertising?<br>
          </b>Yes and No. Visitors may access Ancestry.com’s free services 
          without providing any personal information. To gain full access to the 
          members-only areas, a username, e-mail address and appropriate billing 
          information are required. Because the Ancestry.com site is partially 
          advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising 
          that appears on Ancestry.com pages, but you may opt to be excluded from 
          any email advertising.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Does Ancestry.com use "IP 
          Addresses" and cookies?<br>

          problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address

          Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal 
          information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only 
          information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. 
          Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when 
          you register at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or 
          "remember" who you are each time you return. Ancestry.com 
          may make limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your 
          interests. For instance they may be used to retain your personal preferences, 
          hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save 
          your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you 
          login.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><u><i>Advertiser Cookies: </i></u>Ancestry.com 
          does post third party advertising banners on personal family Web sites 
          and on Ancestry.com general use pages. These ads may contain cookies 
          used primarily to provide data to the advertiser about where visitors 
          are coming from. While we do use cookies in other parts of our Web site 
          as explained above, cookies received with banner ads may or may not 
          be collected by our company or be under our control.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Are Chat room dialogues recorded 
          and saved?<br>
          </b>Chat is not currently offered at Ancestry.com but will be in the 
          future. Dialogues will NOT be collected, stored, or used by the company 
          or others.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>What else should I know about 
          privacy?<br>
          </b>The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context 
          above.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="geneva, arial"><b>Member Profiles<br>
          </b>Demographic data is collected at our site at the users’ option. 
          This information may include age and gender and other personal preferences 
          that can be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing Ancestry to advertisers 
          and others. In no case is personal information given or sold to third 
          parties. Ancestry.com controls the distribution of ALL information at

            We use this data to send users promotional material about our company 
            or our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to 
            contact the visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies 
            for promotional purposes, but only with your prior permission and 
            under the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the 
            promotion. At any time, users may opt-out of receiving future mailings 
            of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.</font>
