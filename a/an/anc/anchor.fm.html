By providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information  through the Anchor Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information  may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Anchor and the authorized third parties referred to herein.<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="55"></p><h4 data-reactid="56">Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies:</h4><!-- react-text: 57 -->When you visit the Anchor Services, we and third parties that provide functionality on the Anchor Services may engage, receive and record information from your use of the Anchor Services and server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and from cookies and similar technology. This information is used to track the total number of Users, the number of visitors of each page to our websites, and the domain names of our Users’ Internet service providers. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Anchor Services may not work properly.<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="58"></p><h4 data-reactid="59">Aggregated Data:</h4><!-- react-text: 60 -->We may anonymize and aggregate data collected through the Anchor Services and use it for any purpose. Such information does not identify you individually.<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="61"></p><h4 data-reactid="62">Social Media:</h4><!-- react-text: 63 -->Through the Anchor Services, you may choose to access certain Social Media Services. When you elect to access and use the Social Media Services, you will be sharing your information (which will include personal information if you elect to share such information) with those Social Media Services. As with other Third Party Sites, the information that you share with the Social Media Services will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such Social Media Services and not by the Anchor’s policies and procedures. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including Anchor. When you provide Anchor access to your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Anchor Services to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Anchor).<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="64">As part of the integration of the Anchor Services with your Social Media Services account, the Social Media Service will provide Anchor with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, including but not limited to post-related meta data from your Twitter feed or Facebook wall (e.g., post type, date of creation, date of update, post creator, permanent link, and the number of “Likes” and “Comments”), and “friends” or users you are “following”. Anchor does not download, save, or store your photos, videos, or status messages posted on your Social Media Services accounts unless you grant it permission to do so. To access your Social Media Services account, we provide a link that directs you to a Social Media Service, like Twitter and Facebook, where you may access the Anchor Services directly. We will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, Anchor shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the Anchor Services.</p><p data-reactid="65"></p><h4 data-reactid="66">Posts, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</h4><!-- react-text: 67 --> The Anchor Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Anchor Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the messages you post; the metadata provided with such posts, such as when you posted and the client application you used to post; the language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create, people you follow, posts you mark as likes, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Anchor Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Anchor Services public for as long as you do not delete it. The Anchor Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Anchor Services content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content via the Anchor Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="68"></p><h4 data-reactid="69">Location Information:</h4><!-- react-text: 70 --> Anchor may receive information about your location.

Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Anchor Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time. &nbsp;If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Anchor Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Anchor Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Anchor Services, and is deleted from our Anchor Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Anchor Services your account on the other service.<!-- /react-text --><p></p><p data-reactid="71"><!-- react-text: 72 -->Anchor uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
