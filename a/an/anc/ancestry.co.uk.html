			<p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="Personal"></a>Privacy Information for Ancestry.co.uk</span></p><p>
			
			</p><p class="body"><b>Overview:</b><br>
				Ancestry.com Operations Inc., (“Ancestry.com”, ”Ancestry”, “we”, “us” or “our”) operator of this site, recognizes the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases from our Website and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. Ancestry.co.uk is owned and operated by Ancestry.com Operations Inc., incorporated in Delaware, USA and the sites are operated in the United States of America. Registration as a user of or subscriber to the ancestry.co.uk Internet service results in your customer information being stored and processed in the United States, and you, in registering or subscribing, specifically consent to that storage and processing.</p>
			
			<p class="body">
				The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to the 
				following Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Does Ancestry ask for personal information?</b><br>
				Yes. Ancestry asks for your name and e-mail address when you sign up as a member and use 
				features such as e-mail. In addition we will need to know your postal address and payment 
				details when you choose to take out a subscription with us or make purchases at the Ancestry 
				online shop. We may ask for similar information at other times, 
				such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by Ancestry 
				and/or our many partners. Most of this information may be 
				entered at your discretion. As a member of Ancestry, you can also choose to share further 
				information about yourself, your background and interests with other members.  The amount 
				and type of the profile information you share in this way is entirely your choice. 
				Information about some of your activity on the site, such as historical records you save, 
				may also be shared with other members in order to help you connect with others researching similar ancestors. 
				See '<a href="#Profiles">Member Profiles</a>' below for more information on how you can edit 
				or control what you allow other members to see about you and your site activity in your public profile or other places on the site.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>How Does Ancestry use my personal information?</b><br>
				Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly 
				Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to 
				efficiently provide you with relevant information.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Ancestry will also use registration information to let you know about new 
				features or other offers of interest from Ancestry, or to address customer 
				service needs and requests.
			</p>
			<p class="body">In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, <b>the advertiser never 
					has access to individual account information. Ancestry does not sell, rent or 
					otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these 
					advertisers.</b> Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the 
				advertising message and Ancestry then displays the ad to appropriate users 
				based on the criteria specified in the order.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Does Ancestry request or require any personal financial information?</b><br>
				To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and purchases at the 
				Ancestry Online Shop, Ancestry will request personal credit card or debit card 
				information. In order to take advantage of other value-added family services 
				that may be offered by Ancestry in the future, users may be required to supply 
				financial information.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Will Ancestry disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
				Ancestry will not disclose any of your personal information, except with your 
				knowledge and consent as described a) in this policy, b) where  personal information 
				is collected through this site and c) as may be required by law, 
				or to protect the rights or property of Ancestry. Circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are 
				specifically described when the data is collected, such as in the User 
				Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. So in all cases 
				you control what, if any, information you disclose.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in aggregate statistical 
				form to attract potential sponsors, partners and advertisers but these statistics will include no 
				personally identifying information. We do reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45 percent of our 
				users are female" or "10,000 members indicate an interest in gardening" in order to describe our 
				services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of 
				confidentiality agreements, we use third party processors in some cases to help us provide 
				services and manage our sites and relationships with you. These may include purchase and 
				order fulfillment, credit card processing, removing duplicate information from lists, providing 
				marketing assistance and providing other customer services. Third-party processors and 
				providers will be given access only to that information needed to perform their support functions, 
				and are prohibited from using it for other purposes.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Additionally, if you click away from Ancestry.co.uk to visit the site of any third 
				party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other 
				personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. 
				These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. We have 
				no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should 
				therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about 
				how your information may be used.</p>
			<p class="body">
				As our business continues to grow, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or business 
				units.  In these transactions, customer information is often one of the transferred 
				assets, remaining subject to promises made in existing privacy statements. Also, 
				in the event that Ancestry, or substantially all of its assets are 
				acquired, customer information will as a matter of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Will my information be used for direct mailings?</b><br>
				With your  agreement, Ancestry will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose 
				of informing you of changes or additions to Ancestry, or of any Ancestry related 
				products and services. You can also choose to receive promotional offers from 
				trusted Ancestry partners.  If you do not want to continue to receive such mailings, 
				you may opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail. or 
				by amending your 'Newsletter and e-mail preferences' in the '<a href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/myancestry/myaccount/default.aspx">My Account</a>' section of 
				this site.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>May I refuse to provide personal information to Ancestry or to accept 
					advertising?</b><br>
				Visitors may access Ancestry's free services by providing a first name, last 
				name, and e-mail address. To gain full access to the members-only areas, a 
				username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required. 
				Because the Ancestry site is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn 
				off" the advertising that appears on Ancestry pages, but you may opt to be 
				excluded from any e-mail advertising.</p>

			<p class="body">
				<b>Family information</b><br>
				Where you choose to invite other family members to view and edit your family 
				tree, we will ask you for the family member's e-mail address. You must first 
				make certain that you have obtained the consent of the family member to the 
				passing of their details by you to Ancestry.  Ancestry will only use this 
				information for the purpose of contacting the relative with their access details 
				and will not use the information for marketing purposes.  In addition you should 
				also make sure that information or material you wish to place on the site about 
				your living relatives is only posted with their prior knowledge and consent.
			</p><p class="body">
				<b><a name="Cookies"></a>Does Ancestry use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</b><br>
				IP Addresses: We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
				server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather 
				broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Ancestry Cookies:</b><br>
				Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal 
				information from your computer's memory, but rather, record only information 
				you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny 
				files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web 
				site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time 
				you return. Ancestry may make limited use of cookies to deliver content 
				specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain your 
				personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save 
				your password so it doesn't have to be re-entered each time you login.</p>
			<p class="body">
				You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help

				<b>Advertiser Cookies:</b><br>
				We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
				companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
				or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that 
				these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely

				<b>What else should I know about privacy?</b><br>
				The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><b><a name="Profiles"></a>Member Profiles</b><br>
				
				
			</p><p class="body">
				<b>Your Public Profile</b><br>
				When you sign-up as a member you are provided with a public member profile 
				pre-populated with your chosen username. Your user name and location will be 
				displayed on the site when you post, comment or interact with other ancestry 
				members.  If you want additional privacy you can edit your username within your 
				public profile to one that does not include any personally identifiable information.  
				You can also enhance your public profile to provide additional information about 
				yourself. Any information including any sensitive personal information that is 
				disclosed in this area becomes public and you should therefore exercise caution 
				when deciding what personal information you choose to disclose. You can customize 
				your settings about how other members can contact you as well as what displays on 
				your Public Profile.  If you do not do this then the default setting is that the 
				information within your Public Profile and also certain elements of your recent 
				activity on the site will be publicly accessible by other members. To edit your 
				preferences <a href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/myancestry/myaccount/communityprefs.aspx">click here</a>.</p> 
			<p class="body">
				Through the <a href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/myancestry/myaccount/communityprefs.aspx">Community Preferences</a> link in the Ancestry '<a href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/myancestry/myaccount/default.aspx">My Account</a>' section of 
				the site, you can choose either to display your e-mail address with other members 
				or ensure that your e-mail is withheld so that you are only contacted anonymously 
				through the Ancestry Connection Service. You can also control when you are contacted 
				or block certain people from contacting you.</p>
			<p class="body">
				You can also customize what other members can learn about your Ancestry site activity.  To help you connect with other members researching similar ancestors, by default new accounts are set up to allow other members to learn about things you publicly add or post to the site, as well as some personal research activities (such as saving historical records to your Shoebox or private member tree).  To customize these settings, simply go to the “Activity Preferences” link on the Community Preferences page. 
				</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Anonymous demographic profiles</b><br>
				Demographic data is collected at our site at the users' option. This 
				information may include age and gender and other personal preferences that can 
				be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing Ancestry to advertisers and 
				others. In no case is personal information given or sold to third parties. 
				Ancestry controls the distribution of ALL information at the site.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b><a name="Contests"></a>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>
				Ancestry may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site 
				in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail 
				address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We 
				use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our 
				partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the 
				visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional 
				purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and 
				conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, users 
				may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to 
				take part in the promotions.</p>
				
			<p class="body">
				<b>Public forums – Ancestry Community</b><br>
				This site makes forums, message boards and/or newsgroups available to its members.  Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should take care when deciding what personal information to disclose to others.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Security</b><br>
				Ancestry places great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our members. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of member data under our control. For example our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized personnel have access to member information.  We use secure server software to encrypt financial information you input before it is sent to us.  While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we will use our best efforts to prevent this.</p>

			<p class="body">
				By using our website and the services you consent to the collection and use of
				your information by the Ancestry. If we decide to change our 
				privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page (or send them to you 
				via e-mail or postal mail) so that you will be aware of what information we collect, 
				how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it in accordance with the 
				Data Protection Act 1998. If you do not consent to any changes to our privacy policy 
				and as a result you would like us not to use or hold your information in accordance 
				with the revised terms, you may instruct us to delete your information by sending 
				an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@ancestry.co.uk">support@ancestry.co.uk</a>.</p>
