			<p class="body"><span class="subhead"><a name="Personal"></a>Privacy Information for Ancestry.co.uk</span><br>
				The Generations Network, Inc., (we, us or our) operator of this site, recognizes the confidentiality of 
				information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases 
				from our Website and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The 
				following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
				this site.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><b>Overview:</b><br>
				The personal, private information that is provided to Ancestry by individual 
				members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in rare cases 
				involving possible violations of our use policies or legal statutes. We do 
				collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, that is used to 
				fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better meet the needs of our 
				users.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Information submitted by you online (such as products you purchase from 
				Ancestry, your name, address, e-mail address) may be shared with companies with 
				which Ancestry has a commerce relationship and through which you reached this 
				site, for marketing purposes. In such circumstances you will be considered 
				their customer as well. If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail 
				request. Under no circumstances will Ancestry share with any other party your 
				password or other personal information it may acquire about children, family, 
				etc.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in 
				aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors.</p>
			<p class="body">
				The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in the answers to the 
				following Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Does Ancestry ask for personal information?</b><br>
				Yes. Ancestry asks for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal 
				information when you sign up as a member and use features such as e-mail, and 
				make purchases at the Ancestry online store. Most of this information may be 
				entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar information at other times, 
				such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by Ancestry 
				and/or our many partners.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>How Does Ancestry use my personal information?</b><br>
				Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly 
				Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to 
				efficiently provide you with relevant information.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Ancestry will also use registration information to let you know about new 
				features or other offers of interest from Ancestry, or to address customer 
				service needs and requests.
			</p>
			<p class="body">In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, <b>the advertiser never 
					has access to individual account information. Ancestry does not sell, rent or 
					otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these 
					advertisers.</b> Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the 
				advertising message and Ancestry then displays the ad to appropriate users 
				based on the criteria specified in the order.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Does Ancestry request or require any personal financial information?</b><br>
				To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and purchases at the 
				Ancestry Online Store, Ancestry will request personal credit card or debit card 
				information. In order to take advantage of other value-added family services 
				that may be offered by Ancestry in the future, users may be required to supply 
				financial information.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Will Ancestry disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
				Ancestry will not disclose any of your personal information, except with your 
				knowledge and consent as described in this policy or as may be required by law, 
				or to protect the rights or property of Ancestry.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are 
				specifically described when the data is collected, such as in the User 
				Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. So in all cases 
				you control what, if any, information you disclose.</p>
			<p class="body">
				We do reserve the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45 percent of our 
				users are female" or "10,000 members indicate an interest in gardening" in order to describe our 
				services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of 
				confidentiality agreements, we use third party processors in some cases to help us provide 
				services and manage our sites and relationships with you. These may include purchase and 
				order fulfillment, credit card processing, removing duplicate information from lists, providing 
				marketing assistance and providing other customer services. Third-party processors and 
				providers will be given access only to that information needed to perform their support functions, 
				and are prohibited from using it for other purposes.</p>
			<p class="body">
				Additionally, if you click away from Ancestry to visit the site of any third 
				party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card or other 
				personal information in order to purchase or use products and services offered. 
				These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices. Ancestry 
				has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You should 
				therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns about 
				how your information may be used.</p>
			<p class="body">
				As our business continues to grow, we might buy or sell subsidiaries or business 
				units.  In these transactions, customer information is often one of the transferred 
				assets, remaining subject to promises made in existing privacy statements. Also, 
				in the event that The Generations Network, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are 
				acquired, customer information will as a matter of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Will Ancestry use my information for direct mailings?</b><br>
				Ancestry will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of 
				changes or additions to Ancestry, or of any Ancestry related products and 
				services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any 
				time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>May I refuse to provide personal information to Ancestry or to accept 
					advertising?</b><br>
				Visitors may access Ancestry’s free services by providing a first name, last 
				name, and e-mail address. To gain full access to the members-only areas, a 
				username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required. 
				Because the Ancestry site is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn 
				off" the advertising that appears on Ancestry pages, but you may opt to be 
				excluded from any e-mail advertising.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b><a name="Cookies"></a>Does Ancestry use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</b><br>
				IP Addresses: We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our 
				server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather 
				broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Ancestry Cookies:</b><br>
				Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal 
				information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information 
				you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny 
				files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web 
				site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are each time 
				you return. Ancestry may make limited use of cookies to deliver content 
				specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain your 
				personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping basket," or save 
				your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>Advertiser Cookies:</b><br>
				We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
				companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
				or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that 
				these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely 
				anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your 
				choices, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b>What else should I know about privacy?</b><br>
				The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above.
			</p>
			<p class="body"><b><a name="Profiles"></a>Member Profiles</b><br>
				Demographic data is collected at our site at the users’ option. This 
				information may include age and gender and other personal preferences that can 
				be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing Ancestry to advertisers and 
				others. In no case is personal information given or sold to third parties. 
				Ancestry controls the distribution of ALL information at the site.</p>
			<p class="body">
				<b><a name="Contests"></a>Contests &amp; Promotions</b><br>
				Ancestry may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site 
				in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail 
				address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We 
				use this data to send users promotional material about our company or our 
				partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the 
				visitor when necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional 
				purposes, but only with your prior permission and under the terms and 
				conditions specified when you take part in the promotion. At any time, users 
				may opt-out of receiving future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to 
				take part in the promotions.</p>
			<p class="body">
