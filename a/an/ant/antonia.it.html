Percentages refer to growth on a comparable basis.&nbsp; 

  Gucci  sealed another market-beating performance with sales&nbsp; up 35.1% to 2.1 billion&nbsp;  euros&nbsp; across all distribution channels, regions and product categories. Robust growth also drove &nbsp;Saint Laurent , which hiked 16.1% as both iconic lines and new collections generated buzz and success.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp;Last but not least, other Kering-owned brands registered a sharp uptick of 32.2%, led by the exceptional momentum at&nbsp; Balenciaga&nbsp; and ongoing growth at&nbsp; Alexander McQueen . 

 The ebullient performances of the houses under the Kering umbrella was well balanced across all distribution channels. Comparable growth in directly operated stores amounted to 27.6%, fueled by double-digit increases across all regions, led by North America, up 36.1%, and Asia Pacific, which surged 33.3%. Growth in&nbsp; online sales&nbsp; exceeded 80% while&nbsp; wholesale&nbsp; rose 27.0%. 

 “We are extraordinarily proud of the remarkable performances Kering delivers quarter after quarter. Our growth, whose pace is unprecedented in the Luxury sector, is sound, well balanced and sustained across all regions and distribution channels. The talent of each of our Houses at creating strong emotional ties with its customers, conceiving a bold, generous creative universe, and reinventing its codes, is at the root of Kering’s success. Beyond short-term developments, we know that the secular growth of the Luxury market, but particularly our solid fundamentals and the discipline with which we implement our strategy, will continue to support our operating and financial outperformance.”

		<meta property="og:description" content=" The brainchild of&nbsp; Anna Blessmann ,&nbsp; a German-born, U.K-based artist ,&nbsp; A Plan Application offers a rational&nbsp;working wardrobe to build on, not replace, season after season.&nbsp; 

 Blessman is a sculptor and her hand appears in the exclusive constructions that fit and adapt to the wearer’s shape and needs. Separates and signature pieces in cotton drill, jersey, denim and merino wool create the perfect uniform for&nbsp; a 24/7 agenda to effortlessly float from studio work to gallery installations, from formal meetings to evening outings. 

 Inspired by Blessmann’s own wardrobe, the A Plan collection includes a tailored adaptation of the classic hooded sweatshirt with a slim waistline; a multi-pocket jumpsuit revisited from a window cleaner’s overalls; slim over-the-knee leather boots, and a kimono collar wrap dress. All in shades of blue, from indigo to cobalt, from azure to icy-blue white.&nbsp; 

 Each is a unique closet staple for a contemporary cultural worker, one who needs to be professional rather than respectable, creative rather than conservative, opinionated rather than conformist. 

 A Plan is part of the&nbsp; New Guards Group , the Milan-based company that controls Off-White, Marcelo Burlon County of Milan, Heron Preston and Palm Angels.&nbsp; 

 Blessmann’s work has been featured in several solo and group shows in European institutions, including KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin and the Kunstmuseum Bonn. 

 Since 2001 she has worked collaboratively with the British artist and graphic designer Peter Saville. Their projects have been exhibited at significant institutions, galleries and art events around the world, including Migros Museum Zurich, Whitechapel Gallery London, FRAC Champagne-Ardenne Reims, MAMCO Geneva, Gallery Neu Berlin, Cabinet London and at the 2016 Okayama Art Summit Japan.

<p>Patta is a Dutch streetwear and sneaker boutique based in the pulsating heart of Amsterdam, founded by&amp;nbsp;<strong>Edson Sabajo</strong>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<strong>Guillaume Schmidt</strong>&amp;nbsp;in 2004.</p>

<p>Transforming the current&amp;nbsp;<strong>logo power mania&amp;nbsp;</strong>into a celebration of&amp;nbsp;<strong>individuality and personality,&amp;nbsp;</strong>elevated by a&amp;nbsp;<strong>consumer-centric experience</strong>, Valextra aficionados enjoyed the opportunity to create a unique all-over monogrammed bag using their initials. In general, the&amp;nbsp;<strong>three-step creative process&amp;nbsp;</strong>starts with the selection of the bag style, the configuration of the initials and the choice of the size and color of the font. A specialized graphic rolls out a variety of combinations, ultimately giving birth to an impactful&amp;nbsp;<strong>one-of-a-kind pattern.&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Each bag is in the works for three months.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>#NoLogoMyLogo is a testament of how Valextra, a traditionally no-logo brand, revisits the logo power, a trend increasingly fueled by the street style and sportswear worlds. With far-sighted acumen, the luxurygoods house has found a way to stay true to its identity while setting off its strong graphic legacy, which dates back to the Sixties.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Born for function and transformed into form, over the decades this hot outerwear label known for its&amp;nbsp;<strong>iconic puffer jackets</strong>, has gained global success and cult status by sticking to its roots while adding a distinctive&amp;nbsp;<strong>fast-paced metropolitan&amp;nbsp;</strong>appeal to its offering.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A bond that rings loud and clear in the new Moncler 1952 collection, part of the&amp;nbsp;<strong>Genius project</strong>, where the label&amp;rsquo;s pillars &amp;ndash; the logo and the puffer jacket - are injected with a contemporary&amp;nbsp;pop and visual vibrancy.&amp;nbsp;To wit, the logo is blown up to macro proportions, commanding attention against the lacquered or matte nylon of the jackets in vitaminic colors such as orange,&amp;nbsp;blue, red, purple and green.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Two-tone combos and graphic mosaic patterns or Navaho motifs also provide standout elements.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The brainchild of CEO Remo Ruffini,&amp;nbsp;<strong>Moncler Genius&amp;nbsp;</strong>is an explosion of&amp;nbsp;<strong>game-changing creativity&amp;nbsp;</strong>that defines the future through the work of&amp;nbsp;<strong>eight designers&amp;nbsp;</strong>who add an authentic, imaginative and unique touch to the brand&amp;rsquo;s signature down jacket.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p><strong>Dior&amp;nbsp;</strong><strong>has sponsored an intensive and delicate three-yearlong restoration of the&amp;nbsp;</strong><strong>Maison de la Reine&amp;nbsp;</strong>at the&amp;nbsp;<strong>Ch&amp;acirc;teau de Versailles in Paris,&amp;nbsp;</strong>a rustic retreat framed by glorious English-inspired gardens that was built for&amp;nbsp;<strong>Marie-Antoinette</strong>. Here she sought refuge from the pressures and rigidity of court life.</p>

<p>Since 1848, the Maison de la Reine was closed to the public due to the fragile state of the buildings. Now, thanks to Dior, plenty of French expertise and incredible human skills, for&amp;nbsp;the first time in two centuries, visitors can soak up the beauty of the&amp;nbsp;<strong>Maison de la Reine,</strong>&amp;nbsp;nestled in a hamlet built by Richard Mique for Marie-Antoinette, between 1783 and 1787. The contrast between the picturesque, rustic exteriors and the awe-inspiring&amp;nbsp;<strong>luxurious interior</strong>&amp;nbsp;offers a striking surprise element.</p>

<p>In this unique setting, the troubled French Queen would spend time with her friends in a more rural, natural and laid-back atmosphere compared to the strictness of the Versailles reality.</p>

After&amp;nbsp;Saint Laurent&amp;rsquo;s death&amp;nbsp;in 2009, Berg&amp;eacute; sold off the priceless pieces collected by the couple, raising 374 million euros.&amp;nbsp;Following&amp;nbsp;Berg&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s death last September, his widower Madison Cox,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;did the same.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>At just 20 years old, <strong>Kylie Jenner has&amp;nbsp;entered&amp;nbsp;the Forbes list of America&amp;rsquo;s richest self-made women</strong>&amp;nbsp;with a bang&amp;nbsp;thanks&amp;nbsp;to her fully-owned&amp;nbsp;<strong>Kylie Cosmetics</strong> <strong>company</strong>,&amp;nbsp;established two years ago. According to the venerable magazine, Jenner made her fortune by launching&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;<strong>lip kit</strong>&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;that consists of a&amp;nbsp;matching lipstick and lip liner,&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;has sold more than $630 million worth of makeup since&amp;nbsp;its introduction.&amp;nbsp;By applying its standard parameters, Forbes has valued&amp;nbsp;her company, which&amp;nbsp;now also includes&amp;nbsp;eye shadow and concealer, at nearly $800 million.&amp;nbsp;Moreover, the young entrepreneur has made more million&amp;nbsp;from TV programs and endorsing products like Puma shoes and PacSun.</p>

<p>Forbes&amp;nbsp;quotes&amp;nbsp;Jenner&amp;nbsp;as &amp;ldquo;conservatively worth&amp;nbsp;<strong>$900 million</strong>, which along with her age makes her the youngest person on the fourth annual ranking of America&amp;rsquo;s Richest Self-made Women.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;In&amp;nbsp;the beginning I struggled with what I wanted to do. I knew I was passionate about&amp;nbsp;make-up,&amp;nbsp;but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I could have&amp;nbsp;fun&amp;nbsp;every day doing my job. I turned to make up to make me feel more confident but could never find a lipliner and lipstick that matched. That&amp;rsquo;s where the lip kit started,&amp;rdquo; says Jenner in an exclusive Forbes video. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Considering that her company in basically entirely virtual with&amp;nbsp;just seven full-time and five part-time employees, according to Forbes, asmost operations&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;outsourced,&amp;nbsp;Jenner&amp;nbsp;is an outstanding force.&amp;nbsp;Anultra-active social media player,&amp;nbsp;Jenner&amp;nbsp;uses&amp;nbsp;IG,&amp;nbsp;Twitter and&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;top platforms for&amp;nbsp;engagement and&amp;nbsp;self-promotion with her perfectly made-up&amp;nbsp;pouty&amp;nbsp;face attracting&amp;nbsp;over 100 million followers.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Having overachieved its initial sales ambition set in 2016 with non-stop ground-breaking results,&nbsp; Gucci&nbsp; has further raised the bar,&nbsp; aiming for the 10 billion euros revenue milestone&nbsp; in an undisclosed timeframe. 

 With sales of&nbsp; 6.2 billion euros in 2017 , reaching the ambitious goal would implement Gucci’s status, now the second largest luxurygoods house after Louis Vuitton, whose sales according to analysts are in the 9 billion euros range. 

 Certainly, the power duo behind the brand’s outstanding success -&nbsp; chief executive officer Marco Bizzarri and creative director Alessandro Michele&nbsp; - keep chugging full steam ahead with sales up 48.7 percent to 1.87 billion euros in the first quarter. This thanks to their ability to have restored Gucci as a major force in directional fashion and willingness to take risks. Spurred by Michele’s ground-breaking creativity and innovative runways shows, Gucci is once again a pivotal fashion brand or, in Michele’s words, “a definitive 21st century statement of contemporary coolness.”

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a glossy coffee-table tome or an intriguing page-turning novel to devour during your idler vacation days, books are a different kind of accessory to indulge with.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cova</strong>, the historic Milanese caf&amp;eacute; and pastry shop located on the tony Via Montenapoleone is celebrating 200 years with a&amp;nbsp;<strong>170-page book published by Assouline</strong>. The book chronicles the expertise, passion, mission and values of Cova, which was&amp;nbsp;<strong>founded in 1817 by a Napoleonic soldier</strong>. It was acquired in the early Eighties&amp;nbsp;by Mario Faccioli, a former butcher who benefitted of a hefty loan by the late entrepreneur Anna Bonomi Bolchini. The&amp;nbsp;book, written by Faccioli&amp;rsquo;s daughters Paola and Daniela, who still helm the business, documents two centuries of success, including its acquisition by&amp;nbsp;LVMH Mo&amp;euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton&amp;nbsp;in 2013 and its international expansion that today counts 29 units, including ones in Hong Kong, Japan, China, Taipei, Dubai and Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Moving down to central Italy, the&amp;nbsp;<strong>Italian Party by Christina Lynch&amp;nbsp;</strong>is an intriguing and compelling spy story where love, mystery, romance and history intertwine. American newly-weds Scottie and Michael Messina arrive in beautiful Siena in 1956, bang in the middle of the Cold War. As they go along, they discover the secrets they are keeping from one another, forcing them to see a more complex view of Italy, America and each other, including Michael&amp;rsquo;s quest to save the world from Communism.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Lynch, who spent four years in Siena soaking up the culture and lifestyle, also lived in Los Angeles where she was on the writing staff of Unhappily Ever After; Encore, Encore; The Dead Zone and Wildfire.</p>

While the collection brims with signature elements such as bows, ruffles, tiers and romantic lace, it also included new prints, the VLTN logo boldly splashed on the iconic bags and a Seventies snake motif.&nbsp; 

 Piccioli’s aim is to share the Maison’s longstanding values and identity with the younger generations, not necessarily familiar with all the imagery from its glorious past. Hence, he created an awe-inspiring and aspirational balance between luxe, expertise and a sporty-cum-streetwear edge, also through a handful of tracksuits.

 The undertaking was made possible as a consequence to the fact that two years ago,&nbsp;the fashion house’s parent company LVMH&nbsp;Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, opted for relocating the Emilio Pucci employees, based in the Palazzo, to Milan&nbsp;to combine the creative and commercial roles.&nbsp; 

 Pucci’s idea behind the extensive make-over of the Palazzo, built by the Pucci family in the 1400s and still owned by the family, was to transform a historical landmark building into a place that would appeal to the younger generations. In other words, a fusion of history and modernity.&nbsp; 

 Pucci put together a Heritage team, young professionals scouted from partnerships with&nbsp; Central Saint Martins and Polimoda , to turn Palazzo Pucci into a center that chronicles and catalogues the story of the brand and Made in Italy production.&nbsp;Multiracial mannequins and statues showcase the new collection or vintage pieces. 

 Developed by architect&nbsp; Piero Lissoni , whose minimal vision is countered by the palace’s frescoes and vaulted ceilings, and by the brand’s iconic swirls of colors and patterns, it also house’s Pucci’s home collection developed with&nbsp; Cappellini, Kartell, Bisazza and B&amp;B Italia.

Soaked in natural daylight, the four buildings will employ&nbsp; 785 workers&nbsp; and will house the production division and the development of the Prada and Miu Miu&nbsp;leather goods&nbsp;collections; warehouses for raw materials; the historical archives of the leather goods and footwear collections; offices for general services and industrial administration; an auditorium; systems areas; and the Prada Group data processing centers. 

 In this structural dialogue between the interiors and the exteriors, between man and nature, the industrial materials are offset by a flourishing vegetation, including grape-vines, mulberries, pomegranates, trees and lavender beds.

 Release number one from this hub of fertile creative minds is&nbsp; Hiroshi Fujiwara for Moncler Fragment . A creative director, musician and record producer from Japan, Fujiwara is a modern-day and multi-faceted cultural agitator with a far-sighted acumen who fuses&nbsp; streetwear, hip hop and general culture.&nbsp; His collection is divided in two parts, the first launching today and the second in December. The first segment melds his music references with a metropolitan take that brings to life the iconic padded fabric bonded with denim and argyle patterns. Jeans, tartan and Fair Isle knits complete the selection, presented in a tight palette of white, dusty blues and jade green. The word Backstage and Moncler Fragment detachable stickers are recurring details.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 The other designers are Valentino’s creative director&nbsp; Pierpaolo Piccioli;&nbsp;Moncler&nbsp;1952; Sandro Mandrino for Moncler Grenoble;&nbsp;Simone Rocha; Craig Green; Noir Kei Ninomiya; and Francesco Ragazzi for Moncler Palm Angels.&nbsp; All challenged with reinventing the down jacket, Moncler’s bread-and-butter.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" From the glitzy runways and bustling life of Los Angeles to the rural wilderness of Canada. A drastic lifestyle change made by  Canadian model Tasha Tilberg , her wife Laura, and their twins Bowie and Gray, who star in the new  Acne Studios ad campaign, a progressive project that highlights diversity , shot around their countryside home in Canada. 

 Tilberg moved to New York when she was 15 years old to start her career. A decade later, she met the talent agent&nbsp;Laura Wilson&nbsp;in Los Angeles, and they tied the knot in Mexico the following month. After the birth of their twins, Bowie and Gray, the family left Los Angeles to live on an organic farm in British Columbia on Canada’s West Coast where they lead an off-grid life, raising children in nature, taking care of their animals and dealing with the challenges of setting up a vineyard surrounded by hungry bears. 

 “I am always fascinated by those people who move away from cities rather than to them. They seem to gain something that I don’t have. That is inspiring. For myself it is about connecting to nature; I find that feeling more and more rewarding,” Jonny Johansson, the Creative Director of Stockholm-based Acne Studios.

<p>For Abloh, football is an opportunity to blend memories of his youth such as playing hip-hop tracks on the way to high school soccer matches, with his interests in mixing lifestyle and sport branding.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Graphic and bold&amp;nbsp;</strong>with&amp;nbsp;<strong>oversized checks, stripes and dots&amp;nbsp;</strong>in black and white, plus splashes of orange, it includes co-branded jerseys, shorts and sweatshirts with plenty of sport typography.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The great thing about the vocabulary and history of football is that aesthetically it has its own look. I was always inspired by the way European teams have a sponsor printed over the chest. When I was working on this collection, I wanted to celebrate the different variants of typography,&amp;quot; says Abloh.</p>

<p>Additionally, all the numbers refer to those Abloh wore during his playing years while the jersey&amp;rsquo;s black-and-white checker board is a subtle nod to Czech strips. With his version of the Flyknit Zoom Fly, Abloh wanted to communicate where a player strikes the ball. &amp;ldquo;So, I put dots on the boot; if you&amp;rsquo;re going to strike the ball, your foot/eye coordination is basically the only variance of chance,&amp;rdquo; says Abloh.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Once again, Abloh delivers the perfect game plan.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="  Nylon&nbsp; is quintessentially&nbsp; Prada.&nbsp; In celebration of the signature industrial material, first introduced with trailblazing creativity&nbsp; in 1984 , the Italian powerhouse has launched&nbsp; “  Nylon Farm,” a&nbsp;new&nbsp; episodic film project&nbsp; that highlight the company’s blend of&nbsp; heritage, present and future through a futuristic fairy-tale.  

 A series of four chapters, where the fantasy of a Prada ‘nylon farm’ is the surreal backdrop for a budding love story. Filmed inside the company’s stark and futuristic industrial plant in Tuscany, the farm is populated with&nbsp; flocks of black cyborg ‘nylon sheep’ - a subtle nod to Philip K. Dick and his long tradition of Science Fiction - whose synthetic fleece is harvested via forward-looking technology and woven into Prada’s signature nylon backpacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, this perfect, meticulously-controlled world of protocol, artificial intelligence and automated machinery requires the control of a human being who brings an added variable -&nbsp;&nbsp;emotion and feelings. 

 The film is available on Prada’s social channels and on prada.com with a dedicated section that explores the inspirations and aesthetic genealogy behind the Prada Nylon collection.

Inspired by the many element that surround him, be it a detail, an enticing shape, a color, a stylish muse, a piece of art or a striking architecture, his exuberant and colorful shoes are the ultimate objects of desire. Just ask Carrie Bradshaw and Blahnik’s gaggle of glitterati fans.&nbsp; 

 For fall, the maestro’s wide-spanning inspiration spans from&nbsp; Sicilian Baroque to Le Corbusier , from iconic model&nbsp; Jean Shrimpton&nbsp; captured during the Sixties by celebrated photographer and longtime friend David Bailey to the legendary&nbsp; Diana Vreeland , Blahnik’s early mentor and fashion expert, renowned for her bold jewelry choices.&nbsp; 

 Blahnik also mined his own personal archives (and why wouldn’t he, after all his career spans 45 years) and hints at one of his favorite films, Doctor Zhivago.&nbsp; 

 In celebration of Shrimpton, Blahnik created effortlessly chic ballerina flats, a kitten-heeled Mary Jane pump in patent leather and the black and white knee-high Wakia boots with block heel while the jewel-toned Vree T-strap with contrasting tongue homages Vreeland. 

 Similarly, the ornate Sicilian Baroque architecture that decorates the island’s stunning churches informed the silhouettes of his court pumps and flats in plush silk satin with a flash of gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Whispered or dazzling, flat or sky-high, each shoe is a true labor of love, a luxurious and seductive treat that will bring out the Princess that is in you. Discover the new arrivals in our boutique.&nbsp;

These are the three words that pop up in the trailer of&nbsp; McQueen , the&nbsp; new documentary film dedicated to Lee “Alexander” McQueen , the legendary designer who tragically took his life in 2010. Words that perfectly describe a visionary whose unique personality, influence and legacy have left a sign and continue to live on.&nbsp; 

  Launched at the Tribeca Film Festival last April , the compelling film, directed by&nbsp; Ian Bonhôte&nbsp; and written by&nbsp; Peter Ettedgui , portrays McQueen’s extraordinary life and prolific career through exclusive interviews with his closest friends, collaborators and family, plus plenty of footage of his ground-breaking fashions shows. 

 Though unauthorized by the McQueen estate and by the Kering-owned Alexander McQueen brand, the film&nbsp;offers an insightful look on the designer’s life, starting from his graduation from Central Saint Martins in 1992 to his tailoring years at Savile Row, from his appointment at Givenchy in 1997 to his blockbuster extravaganzas. Plus, his final years before he committed suicide in 2010, including his mental illness and addictions.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Spending a day with the&nbsp; Missonis&nbsp; in their&nbsp; Sumirago&nbsp; headquarters is an inspiring, leisurely and refreshing experience that&nbsp; blurs the line between work and pleasure . During my journalistic years at WWD and W, I had plenty of occasions to drive up to their lush, secluded, sprawling estate so I consider myself a fair judge. And, lunch was truly a special savory moment of indulgence thanks to their delicious home-cooked dishes. Indeed, their cuisine and entertainment are as singular as their fashion. Whether they are serving a meal for 20 or 200, all feature family recipes curated for the season and occasion.&nbsp; 

 These legendary recipes can now be shared thanks to&nbsp; Francesco Maccapani Missoni&nbsp; and his&nbsp; The Missoni Family Cookbook , compiled with the help of his&nbsp; grandmother Rosita and his mother Angela&nbsp;  Missoni . The foreword was written by&nbsp; Quincy Jones&nbsp; who believes that “Missoni food makes you smile.” 

 In the book by&nbsp; Assouline , Maccapani Missoni chronicles the family’s culinary tradition, making the delicious, well-guarded family recipes, passed down from generation to generation, available to the home cook for the first time.&nbsp; 

 “At home, we only use strictly seasonal, fresh, and locally available ingredients, and we grow most of the herbs and vegetables in our garden,” says Francesco Maccapani Missoni, who is as passionate about food as he is about design, film and contemporary art.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Friend and French photographer&nbsp; Gilles Bensimon&nbsp; revels at how you “travel along a strange path that might make you doubt it leads to your destination, but no – it goes to Angela’s house! Already at the table, even if you think you’re not hungry, it’s exactly like Missoni: a rainbow of flavors, smells like colors, and the wine you’re discovering becomes your friend – exactly like the privilege of being friends with the Missonis.”

True to the designer&amp;rsquo;s hyper successful ability to bond different elements such as&amp;nbsp;<strong>uptown elegance with geeky cool</strong>, the collection is an explosion of colors, logos, retro details, prints and vivid colors, inspired by the bold and brash Seventies and Eighties. Printed silk pieces, bow blouses, GG sweaters, ruffled dresses and track pants for her and vibrant athleisure pieces, embroidered shirts and embellished leather for him.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>For the ad campaign, instead, Michele traveled to Paris, and back in time to 1968 circa, when the social revolution planted the seed of change. He chose the atmosphere of the Parisian universities at the dawn of the country&amp;#39;s student revolution when the young rebels also fell in love, passed scribbled notes and read poetry.&amp;nbsp;</p>

From&nbsp;numerous&nbsp; Vogue &nbsp;covers to all the top runways, from music video appearances to a career in TV, Naomi was a lifelong muse of Donatella Versace and Azzedine Alaïa.

The fruit of his mind-blowing trip to the Philippines is the ornate and eye-catching <strong>Manilacaba bag.</strong></p>

<p>Stuck in the legendary traffic jams of <strong>Manila</strong>, Louboutin was stunned by the overflowing joy, the energy, the splashes of vibrant colors and by the city&amp;rsquo;s iconic trucks, or <strong>Jeepneys</strong>, once ordinary Jeeps abandoned by American troops after World War II. Now customized with lively decorations by the people of Manila, who fill up every space to keep the evil spirits away, these trucks celebrate life with a joyful style that Louboutin immediately related to.</p>

<p>The Manilacaba celebrates this light-hearted atmosphere. The sequined and embroidered front panel winks playfully at the crowded Jeepneys, a referenced inside the bag in an eye-popping pattern. Upon closer inspection, one notices that the designer added a little humorous destination for each truck.</p>

<p>Hop on, and enjoy a special journey suspended between <strong>Filipino art, traditional costumes and</strong> <strong>Louboutin&amp;rsquo;s artsy vision</strong>. The details, including Swarovski crystals, pearlescent shells and sequins, recall the <strong>awe-inspiring seas</strong> that bathe the Philippines, its crystal-clear waters, the lagoons, the coral reefs and shells.</p>

<p>Just like with the previous bags, the Manilacaba also supports local women through a partnership with <strong>GREAT (Gender Responsive Economic Action for the Transformation of Women) Women</strong>, a platform supporting the economic empowerment of female Asian artisans by exporting their products and craftsmanship around the world. Ten percent of sales from every Manilacaba will be devolved to the association.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;I have always been captivated by the Philippines&amp;rsquo; beauty: the perfect combination of sparkles, Mother-Of-Pearl and shells. But this project really started to make sense to me when I discovered the richness and the quality of craftmanship the GREAT Women in ASEAN artisans were able to develop,&amp;rdquo; said Christian Louboutin</p>

<p>So, waste no time and grab yours before the tide washes it away!</p>

<p>For Delfina, the &amp;ldquo;Peekaboo is mysterious, precious like a piece of jewelry, and timeless, because it can be passed down through generations.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>The video highlights all the Peekaboos, from Large and Regular to Mini and Micro, in their many variations on the theme. A Fendi-style success story that includes all the family members &amp;ndash; the 2Jours, the By The Way and the Kan I.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="PUMA'S Q1 RESULTS SPRINT AHEAD">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" German sportswear giant Puma continues to chug ahead notwithstanding the economic challenges, volatile currency rates and an uncertain trade climate. Sales&nbsp;in the first quarter of 2018 increased by 21.5 percent currency-adjusted to 1.13 billion euros compared to 1 billion euros last year. 

 Net earnings&nbsp;hiked 35.8 percent to 67.4 million euros compared to last year’s 49.6 million euros.&nbsp; 

 All regions and product segments fueled the growth with a particularly bullish performance in the Asia/Pacific region, driven by China, where sales ballooned 34.8 percent in the first quarter. Footwear continued to be the main driver, followed by apparel and accessories. 

 &nbsp;“We started the year with both first-quarter sales and profitability (EBIT) coming in stronger than we had expected. The double-digit sales growth in all regions and product segments, including an exceptionally high growth in Asia, led to a very strong 21.5% organic sales increase,” noted Bjørn Gulden, Chief Executive Officer of Puma SE. “Because of an uncertain business environment caused by&nbsp;volatile currency rates&nbsp;and the&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;economic trade environment, we raised our outlook for the full year only slightly. We now expect our sales to grow 10% to 12% in local currency (previous 10%) and EBIT to come in between € 310 to € 330 million (previous € 305 to € 325 million).”

<p>As the demand for accessories has nearly doubled in the last three years, ArtLab will speed up and rationalize the production with full control over the various steps.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The unveiling of Gucci ArtLab definitely represents one of the most remarkable achievements of Gucci&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented journey of the last three years, and one of the most significant industrial investments today in our country,&amp;rdquo; says&amp;nbsp;<strong>Marco Bizzarri, President and CEO of Gucci</strong>. &amp;ldquo;It is a testament to our belief in creativity, artisanal craftsmanship, innovation and technology, and sustainability, and our bond with our territory.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Belgian luxurygoods house <a href='http://wwd.com/business-news/human-resources/sonia-rykiel-julien-soyez-top-communications-role-11138909/'><strong>Delvaux</strong></a>&amp;nbsp;has chosen the Antonia boutique to host an exclusive <strong>kitchen-themed installation</strong> timed in conjunction with the <strong>Salone del Mobile</strong>, the annual international furniture fair that takes Milan by storm every April. The graphic display serves as the backdrop to celebrate Delvaux&amp;rsquo;s new bag, the <strong>Cool Box</strong>, named after its shape which recalls an icebox.</p>

<p>Bonding fashion and design, the <strong>eye-catching surrealist display</strong> in tonal <strong>milky white</strong> spotlights rows of the Cool Box bag in luxurious pantry hues, pastels and spicy colors, neatly shelved inside a fridge and kitchen counter. The graphic black and white 3D motif that frames the windows is a playful and impactful tribute to Milan&amp;rsquo;s status as the unrivalled capital of design. Flashes of neon lighting provide an unexpected surprise element.</p>

<p>Besides celebrating Delvaux&amp;rsquo;s latest bag style and Milan&amp;rsquo;s buzzy design week, the collaboration honors the longstanding and thriving relationship between Antonia and Delvaux.</p>

<p>The Cool Box will further elevate this special success story. Melding lightness, functionality and elegance, it is made from a single piece of butter-soft leather. At once voluptuous, supple and sturdy, it opens and closes with a single gesture as the wide band that runs across the top, artfully adorned with a silver or gold metal D, lifts to reveal a zipper.</p>

<p>The Cool Box also reflects Delvaux&amp;rsquo;s virtuosity for unique details with unlined leather, exquisite handles and a detachable strap. The vibrant color palette includes unexpected combinations such as Paprika and Turquoise, Saffron and Ebony, Nakuru (inspired by the Kenyan lake famous for its flocks of pink flamingos) and Ivory.</p>

<p>An authentic <strong>Belgian</strong> brand since <strong>1829</strong>, Delvaux was founded a year before the birth of the Belgian nation, which declared its independence from the Netherlands in 1830. Under the stewardship of King L&amp;eacute;opold of Saxe-Cobourg Gotha, an uncle of the future Queen Victoria of England, Belgium enjoyed significant growth, becoming the world&amp;rsquo;s fourth-largest economic power by 1901. Delvaux thrived honoring the grandeur, tradition and symbols of Belgium, earning the title of &amp;quot;royal warrant holder of the court of Belgium.&amp;quot; Because as King Leopold II famously proclaimed, &amp;quot;The nation of Rubens must be as great in its art as in its commerce and industry.&amp;quot;</p>

<p>In 1908, Delvaux registered the first ever patent handbag setting the base for future growth.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="FEATURE PERFECT: AN EXCLUSIVE TALK WITH JOHANNA ORTIZ">
		<meta property="og:description" content="  Johanna Ortiz is on a roll . The Colombian designer certainly took the fashion world by storm with her  ultra-feminine and dramatic aesthetic  defined by off-the-shoulder tops and dresses with festive tiers, bouncy ruffles, and a Latino-infused sensuality. 

 “My creative process is deeply rooted to my Latin background. It’s all about joyful prints, color palettes, volumes and dramatic shapes that are characteristic of heated salsa nights and tropical festiveness,” says Ortiz of her flourishing namesake label in  an   exclusive interview . 

 Ortiz, who dresses the likes of  Beyoncé, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Garner, Mandy Moore and Olivia   Palermo , studied Fashion Design at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. After graduating with top honors, she returned to her native Colombia and set up her couture label in Cali, where she was born and raised. Her first Resort collection bowed in 2002 and evolved into a full-fledged women’s ready-to-wear line by 2014. 

 For sure, you can always count on Ortiz to bring a ray of South American sunshine and steam into your day. Citing such elements as ruffles and oversized shirting as hallmarks, she points out that evolution comes in the form of “integrating new silhouettes as well as beautiful tropicália-themed prints made in the atelier in Cali.” 

 Similarly, the pretty brunette thrives to strike the right balance between  femininity and strength , between  female empowerment and effortless elegance . It’s not by chance that her muses are Lee Radziwill and real women that express individuality. 

 Elaborating on the sexy-versus-sensual dilemma, Ortiz states it’s all about “balance, body language and attitude. The elegance of the neckline with the off-shoulder top is the perfect reference of Latin sensuality with refinement.” 

 Her creative spark is kindled by everyday life, from long walks on the beach to club hopping to leisurely balmy Sunday afternoons reading a book. Because, after all, “life itself drives creativity.” 

 In terms of growth, Ortiz is chugging full-steam ahead to expand and establish her brand globally. With 350 employees in her Colombia headquarters, she is keen to grow that number and generate more opportunities with her hometown with which she is deeply rooted to. It’s no wonder she has become a fashion ambassador for Colombia, invited to show her collections at the White House and at the UN center in New York. “I believe in giving back to my country which is why working with indigenous communities in Colombia and with women who are head of households is a top priority for me,” she stresses.

 The Paris-based designer launched her label in 2002 as an art project hinged on upcycling vintage garments that has resulted in colorful and playful collections, and as a creative agency whose clients include Nike, Lacoste, Uniqlo and Eastpak, among others. 

 “I created Andrea Crews and an alter-ego, someone who embraces life and stirs things up. A fictional figure in whom we all recognize ourselves, American or Spanish, super hero or conquistador, Andrea Crews is a superego, free and generous, ready to defy the established order,” says Rebecq. 

 Fashion wise, the collections are oversized, unisex and bold, playing with inventive fabric mixes and the hijacking of dress codes. Each one, including the streetwear couture line and the handicraft offering tell a story made from unique recycled pieces created in the Parisian studio.&nbsp;

His vision is bold, extravagant and over-the-top, effortlessly straddling the past and future, artistry and virtuosity. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling his collection &amp;lsquo;<strong>The Art of Creation as an</strong> <strong>Act of Resistance,&amp;rsquo;</strong> Michele&amp;rsquo;s spring feast is a joyful hymn to self-determination, a celebration of the freedom to decide about one&amp;rsquo;s own body and life. An invitation to be yourself: the only true transgression that ensures us to get closer to happiness.</p>

<p>His clothes certainly are infectious and upbeat. In an homage to 80s video gaming culture, the Guccy print in SEGA&amp;reg; logo font&amp;mdash;a fixture in the colorful arcades and coin-operated game rooms of the time, steals the spotlight, similarly to the Guccification logo.&amp;nbsp;Both are splashed throughout, appearing on the accessories, Tees and sweatshirts.</p>

<p>Amping the glamour factor is the spate of typical feminine flourishes, including ribbons, bows, lace, pearls and crystal details while silks are primarily printed with bold floral patterns.</p>

<p>In the same vein is the new advertising campaign that features the work of Spanish artist and illustrator <strong>Ignasi Monreal</strong>. The images evoke a <strong>&amp;lsquo;Utopian Fantasy&amp;rsquo;</strong> via three elements &amp;ndash; the earth, the sea and the sky. The vivid photorealist artworks woo us into a magical and uncanny world, viewed through a surreal and heightened sensual lens. Monreal&amp;rsquo;s digital paintings are full of surprising detail and fantastical features that create haunting characters that inhabit the mythical universe conjured from his remarkable imagination. Gucci&amp;rsquo;s products are peppered throughout, becoming part of an extraordinary, highly visual narrative.</p>

<p>After all, to say it in Michele&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;ldquo;Creation is a poetic act.&amp;rdquo;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Whoever has worked the fashion scene over the past decades has had the privilege of bumping into the <strong>larger-than-life personality and eccentricity of Andr&amp;eacute; Leon Talley</strong>, the 67-year-old fashion veteran and <strong>former Vogue US editor at large</strong>. And, believe me, it&amp;rsquo;s not an overstatement.</p>

<p>So unique is his personality, career and achievements that next month <strong>Magnolia Films</strong> will release <strong>&amp;ldquo;The Gospel According to Andr&amp;eacute;</strong>,&amp;rdquo; a film by <strong>Kate Novack</strong> that chronicles the life of the fashion guru portrayed in a lively yet intimate manner.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;nbsp;premiered last summer&amp;nbsp;at the Toronto&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://wwd.com/eye/people/hannah-john-kamen-ready-player-one-1202639591/'>Film</a>&amp;nbsp;Festival.</p>

<p>With his towering physique, outlandish style and critically discerning eye, Leon Talley was a fixture on the fashion scene, an influencer who ultimately impacted culture. He admits that people have said nasty things about him like when they called me &amp;ldquo;Queen Kong because I was a gay ape, but I had to move on, to get on with my career.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Starting with his grandmother, he claims that &amp;ldquo;all my relatives had style&amp;hellip;you can be aristocratic without having been born in an aristocratic family.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Leon Talley grew up where going to Church was &amp;ldquo;the thing in life,&amp;rdquo; a weekly appointment that doubled as a fashion show as in the best tradition.</p>

<p>The documentary features exclusive interviews with Anna Wintour, Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs, Valentino Garavani,&amp;nbsp;Diane von Furstenberg, Manolo Blahnik, Fran Lebowitz, Whoopi Goldberg and Isabella Rossellini, among others, who describe him as a &amp;ldquo;black super hero,&amp;rdquo; one with a &amp;ldquo;bombastic personality.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>He began his career with Andy Warhol&amp;rsquo;s Factory in the 1970s.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>For his collaboration with <strong>NikeLab, Riccardo Tisci</strong> seeks to propel a contemporary <strong>sports style</strong> into a new, more <strong>elegant era</strong>. His latest stint once again draws from the past, combining different generations of sportswear icons, matched to his cutting-edge personal style, for a dynamic collection of off-court styles and accessories for both men and women.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;I live for sports,&amp;quot; says Tisci.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s always been sportswear in my style, and I believe the mix of sport, street and elegance is really good.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Tisci is one of those designers who effortlessly blends sportswear and luxury, bold graphics with a timeless feel, starting from the clothing and all the way down to the footwear, sneakers first and foremost. In this light, he flexed his creative muscle to rework the <strong>Air Force 1,</strong> Tisci&amp;rsquo;s go-to shoe, now out in two new colorways - <strong>black/yellow/red and pink/red/burgundy</strong>. Detail wise, the <strong>swoosh</strong> is flanked by the <strong>star</strong>, a Tisci signature.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m obsessed with the shoe. It&amp;#39;s very clean and pure, but at the same time elaborate. It&amp;rsquo;s the shoe that best represents my style and my collaboration with Nike,&amp;rdquo; says Tisci.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;In the 90s, basketball players became kind of like rock stars. But now, they are more than rock stars. They&amp;rsquo;re superhuman &amp;mdash; representative of historic mythology.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a prevalence of<strong> black with colored accents</strong>, the clothes reflect the same cutting-edge vision &amp;ndash; street credibility and relaxed elegance in equal parts.&amp;nbsp;</p>

Shot by <strong>Talia Chetrit</strong>, it ultimately celebrates strong women in a timely fashion as female empowerment is an increasingly sensitive and critical issue.</p>

<p>For the campaign, Lewis was asked to create her own character, one that mirrored herself and the collection, inspired by cinema and by the many strong female characters it is a voice for.</p>

<p>In the energetic images, Lewis sports a black fringed bob, and comes across as one tough girl with her bold, don&amp;rsquo;t-mess-with-me poses. Her attire varies, from sharp pant suits in lime green to vivid Hawaiian prints, from embroidered suede blouses to slinky dresses in acidy tones.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>So it&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;<strong>Off-White founder </strong><a href='http://wwd.com/tag/virgil-abloh/'><strong>Virgil Abloh</strong></a>&amp;nbsp;is the new men&amp;rsquo;s wear artistic director at&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/women-for-women-international-host-sheinspiresme-charity-sale-1202633476/'><strong>Louis Vuitton</strong></a>. The red-hot designer succeeds <a href='http://wwd.com/tag/kim-jones/'><strong>Kim Jones</strong></a>, who was just named <strong>artistic director at Dior Homme, creating a major shake-up at the LVMH Group-owned brands</strong>. Abloh will unveil his first effort in June during Men&amp;rsquo;s Fashion Week in Paris.</p>

<p>For sure, Abloh is bound to stir things up at Louis Vuitton, one of the oldest, most prestigious and desirable brands in the luxe industry. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;Having followed with great interest Virgil&amp;rsquo;s ascent since he worked with me at Fendi in 2006, I am thrilled to see how his innate creativity and disruptive approach have made him so relevant, not just in the world of fashion but in popular culture today. His sensibility towards luxury and savoir-faire will be instrumental in taking Louis Vuitton&amp;rsquo;s menswear into the future&amp;rdquo; said Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton&amp;rsquo;s Chairman &amp;amp; CEO.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;It is an honor for me to accept the position of Men&amp;rsquo;s Artistic Director for Louis Vuitton. I find the heritage and creative integrity of the House are key inspirations and will look to reference them both while drawing parallels to modern times,&amp;rdquo; stated Virgil Abloh.</p>

<p>Abloh, who studied civil engineer and architect, is also a top-notch DJ and the Creative Director of Kanye West. He is among a crop of successful designers who is well grounded in the web culture, art, street fashion and luxury scenes.</p>

<p><strong>With typical far-sighted acumen, Antonia </strong>was one of the first retailers to support and carry the Off-White label, embracing <strong>Abloh&amp;rsquo;s forerunning vision and sensibility</strong> in seamlessly bonding the luxury scene and the hopping street-meets-pop culture.</p>

<p>It&amp;rsquo;s not by chance that Off-White defines the gray area between black and white. Abloh launched Off-White in 2013, immediately generating hype and wooing top influencers and celeb types. The label&amp;rsquo;s logo of <strong>large diagonal stripes</strong>, in fact, quickly became a cult symbol among the young, cool generation.</p>

<p>Made in Milan, Off-White favors seasonless pieces that are finely crafted using the best fabrics, fits and fabrications. The goal? To be a young brand embracing the now in a sophisticated manner.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>If one of the world&amp;#39;s most prominent collectors of vintage shoes and apparel adds his touch to an icon like the <strong>Air Max,</strong> and participates in a competition, guess what, he wins big time. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what happened to <strong>Sean Wotherspoon</strong>, the founder of the buzzy Round Two thrift shop and lifelong Nike fan, who designed the Air Max 1/97 SW to reflect his passion for the <strong>Eighties culture</strong> and for vintage corduroy caps, as well as his native Virginia and LA. He also fused his two favorite sneakers - the Air Max 1 and the Air Max 97.</p>

<p>The limited-edition Nike 1/97 is part of the Nike&amp;rsquo;s Vote Forward campaign, which gave Wotherspoon the opportunity to inject his creative vision into his favorite kick. During last year&amp;rsquo;s Air Max Day, fans got the chance to vote for their favorite &amp;ldquo;RevolutionAir&amp;rdquo; style.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The sneaker&amp;rsquo;s standout features include an eye-catching fresh <strong>corduroy upper</strong> made from colored strips, stretching from coral to navy, from gold to turquoise, while a chunky Air Max 1 midsole adds uniqueness.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Sure, the Air Max debuted with a bang in 1987. Over the decades, it became an icon that transitioned seamlessly from the track to the streets, reimagined, reinvented, retooled. But always steeped in heritage. And always super cool.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Ah, the unwavering fascination for the unknown. In that light,  the second Off-White for Art Dad capsule  collection is inspired by  new galaxies and interstellar journeys , as well as by fantasies of the intergalactic that are referenced in many famous  jazz pieces from the Fifties to the Seventies . In those years, traveling to outer space was a musical fantasy, a way to escape from three decades of war, economic decline and centuries of slavery and racial oppression.&nbsp; 

 Translated into fashion with a playful angle, the new project brings a  “retrofuturism”  touch with an abundance of transparencies as in sheer plastic raincoats, reflective windbreakers, printed cosmic motifs on sweatshirts, a star-flecked bomber, a silver vest and flashes of neon bright details. 

 It’s countdown for this unique style journey.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Named after the initials of <strong>Givenchy&amp;rsquo;s landmark Paris address on Avenue George V, number 3</strong>, the <strong>GV3</strong> is the <strong>first bag designed by Artistic Director Clare Waight Keller</strong>, who joined the Maison last year. The <strong>British designer</strong> is also the first-ever female designer at the house.</p>

<p>Mirroring Waight Keller&amp;rsquo;s signature aesthetic, the GV3 is a <strong>study of contrasts</strong> that fully captures the duality that characterizes the French label. Belding legacy and currency, this new closet essential, adorned with the iconic interlocking <strong>Double G clasp and chain strap</strong>, is at once classy and sassy, sleek and casual.<br />
Petite yet roomy thanks to a three-compartment accordion structure, the GV3 is defined by a less is-more design that artfully offsets its timeworn patina and labor-intensive finishes.&amp;nbsp;<br />
Besides a tempting range of solid colors, there are plenty of hard-to-resist combinations to choose from, starting with the shiny full-grain goatskin matched to a hand-dabbed matt lambskin whose nuances add depth and character. Similarly, the highest form of virtuosity brings to life hand-painted and dyed exotic skins that are painstakingly hand-assembled, each exposed raw seam painted by hand for an impeccable finishing touch.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Jones, whose ability to blend streetwear and luxe has earned him top points in the industry, and plenty of hype, will bring a gust of legacy-meets-currency novelty at Dior Homme.

<p>The Row was established in 2006 with the aim to create the perfect T-shirt. From the very beginning, Antonia recognized the unique quality and exceptional fit of this luxury essential at a time when the market lacked this kind of offering.</p>

<p><strong>In a relaxed and elegant atmosphere</strong>, with trays of finger food and champagne floating around, the sisters entertained clients and aficionados, who indulged with the label&amp;rsquo;s latest arrivals.</p>

<p>The new season is shaped around <strong>simplicity and lightness</strong>. Sinuous lines define the waist with sculpted virtuosity while drapes fall into soft flares.&amp;nbsp;<strong>Evergreen closet staples</strong> such as the trench coat, the duster and the opera coat in foamy cashmere, double-face silk, poplin and paper leather are pared down and essential. With their ability to reinvent the classics, silk ribbed tank tops, low-slung khakis and linen chinos evoke a timeless and timely ease.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides their signature palette of neutrals, the designers infused gentle tones of lavender, limestone, seafoam and dusty rose, countered by accents of ochre, aubergine and fuchsia.</p>

<p>As evening descends, the spotlight shines on dreamy floor-grazing gowns in layers of washed silk charmeuse, cut in apron, column and camisole shapes. Exclusive details include a silk chord that fastens a halter neck and hand-beaded mesh. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Far from a memoir, the lively tome captures the life, career and personality of this <strong>vibrant 96-year old</strong> <strong>fashion icon</strong>, at once model, muse, designer and style setter.</p>

<p>Apfel takes the reader on an intimate and immersive journey about her life story and unwavering passion for fashion, recounted through personal musings, standpoints, style essays and anecdotes, all framed by a rich and variegated imagery.</p>

<p><strong>Witty, well-versed, smart and versatile</strong>, Apfel shares and discusses several topics, from her restoration works at the White House to her aversion for social media to her creativity celebrated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>Past aside, Apfel still rocks. Actually, she&amp;rsquo;s working even harder, in part to ease the loss of her husband <strong>Carl Apfel,</strong> who died a couple of years ago, after 68 years spent together. Together they cofounded <strong>Old World Weavers</strong>, a textile manufacturing company specialized in reproducing antique fabrics and whose clientele included Greta Garbo, Estee Lauder, Montgomery Clift and Joan Rivers.</p>

<p>Apfel&amp;rsquo;s penchant for thinking out of the box is also evident in her signature look - cropped gray hair, oversized round glasses, brightly colored attire and piles of eccentric costume jewelry.</p>

<p>Spurred by such a high-wattage and action-packed life, Apfel shows no sign of slowing down, claiming that age is just a number, and citing Abraham Lincoln, who said, &amp;ldquo;In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s not the years in your life that count. It&amp;rsquo;s the life in your years.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;</p>

 Brunschwig, who attended the F/W 2018-19 Fendi show flanked by  Beccari, Sidney Toledano, executive chairman of the LVMH Group, and   Toni Belloni, LVMH Group Managing Director,  arrives at the Roman luxurygoods house from  Dior Homme ,&nbsp;where he was Chairman and CEO since September 2015. He will liaise with  Karl Lagerfeld , at the creative helm of the ready-to-wear collections since 1965, and with  Silvia Venturini Fendi , responsible for the accessories and for the men’s wear. He reports to Belloni. 

 In moving the brand forward, the executive will continue to revisit Fendi’s glorious past with a fun twist and lots of currency for the modern and plugged-in consumer. 

 “I am pleased to welcome Serge as the new Chairman and CEO of Fendi. He has developed extensive experience in Luxury Retail, Operations, and Brand Management. Over the recent years, he has played a key role in the success of Christian Dior Couture. Serge is the right leader to take the beautiful Fendi Maison and its strong organization to the next level,” said Toni Belloni. 

 A graduate of Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications and Sciences Po Paris, Serge joined LVMH in 1995. Within the Group, he held senior positions in luxury retail, successively with Louis Vuitton in Asia, then with Sephora Europe and Louis Vuitton, as Managing Director. In 2006, he was appointed Chairman and CEO of Céline before joining Christian Dior Couture in 2008 as Chief Operating Officer. Serge has been Chairman and CEO of Dior Homme since 2015.

				<meta property="og:title" content="BURBERRY TAPS RICCARDO TISCI AS CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER">
		<meta property="og:description" content="  Riccardo Tisci  will replace  Christopher Bailey  at  Burberry . The announcement ends months of speculation after Bailey announced months ago he would step down following his adieu show, held in London for the F/W 2018-19 season.&nbsp; 

  A graduate of Central Saint Martins in London,  Tisci will be based in the British capital and will oversee all the Burberry collections. He will present his first effort in September. 
&quot;I am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry as its new Chief Creative Officer and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti. I have an enormous respect for Burberry's British heritage and global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand,&quot;&nbsp;said Tisci.&nbsp; 

 He was tapped by Marco Gobbetti, CEO of Burberry, who said that he is “delighted that Riccardo is joining Burberry as Chief Creative Officer. Riccardo is one of the most talented designers of our time. His designs have an elegance that is contemporary and his skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today’s luxury consumer. Riccardo’s creative vision will reinforce the ambitions we have for Burberry and position the brand firmly in luxury.” 

 The Italian duo, now reunited at Burberry, worked together at Givenchy where Tisci was Creative Director from 2005 to 2017 while Gobbetti was President and CEO of the storied French house from 2004 through 2008. 

 Tisci’s daring aesthetic that seamlessly melds sizzle, street and luxe was pivotal in transforming  Givenchy into a star brand within the LVMH Group portfolio . And now the two have big plans to start a new chapter for Burberry, one that will leverage on the past with currency to ultimately drive sales, reach out to a new generation of luxury consumers and spiff up the accessories business. And, as many expect, Tisci won’t play it safe. 

 A hard-core sneaker head and the proud owner of hundreds of pairs, Tisci has lent his touch to high-profile collaborations with Nike and Puma. He also designed the stage outfits for the world tours of  Madonna,   Beyoncé and Rihanna , as well as  Kim Kardashian ’s famous Givenchy couture lace wedding dress. 

 Founded in 1856, Burberry owns the trademark of the Burberry logo, the Equestrian Device and the Burberry Check.

<p>The <strong>eight collections for men and women</strong>, which will be launched as special drops over the next months, were unveiled in Milan in February during Fashion Week.</p>

<p>Imaginative, original and impactful, they span across the board, from Piccioli&amp;rsquo;s floor-grazing, A-lined puffer gowns to the slouchy-grungy street vibe of Moncler 1952 to a profusion of bold floral patterns splattered over the Moncler Grenoble outerwear. And still, Simone Rocha displayed a penchant for layers, tiers and ruffles, countered by Craig Green&amp;rsquo;s futuristic, thick armor-like padding. Noir Kei Ninomiya and Hiroshi Fujiwara played with sculptural effects and artsy accents while Palm Angels&amp;rsquo; Francesco Ragazzi opted for a sportier edge.</p>

<p>The overall project brings a gust of novelty to the Moncler collections, which will further coddle the label&amp;rsquo;s fans with fresh new offerings and a wider product range.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" As expected, it was a mob scene. The arrival of  Gigi Hadid at the Antonia boutique  was quite the event in town with hordes of screaming groupies clamoring to get a glimpse of the supermodel-cum-Insta-queen-cum-celebrity who made  a personal appearance  to celebrate the retail launch of the new  “TommyXGigi” Spring 2018 capsule collection , available  exclusively at Antonia a day before it debuted  on the catwalk of the  TommyNow Drive see-now-buy-now runway show on Sunday night.&nbsp;  

 The spring 2018 TommyxGigi collection marks the fourth by the supermodel, who is also the brand’s ambassador. 

 Leaving the commotion outside, inside the Antonia boutique, the mood was casual, easy and intimate with an upbeat and friendly Hadid posing and drifting around among a selected crowd of  trendy Millennials , as music played in the background. &nbsp; 

 From the windows to the interiors, the entire store was blanketed with the TommyxGigi line-up for women and with the TommyNow men’s and women’s collections.&nbsp; 

 After staging TommyNow fashion shows in New York, Los Angeles and London,&nbsp;Tommy Hilfiger,&nbsp; whose company is a division of PVH Corp., chose Milan for his latest experiential runway show called Drive, complete with a racetrack set, which drew a crowd of 2,000 people. Showing in different cities is part of Hilfiger’s ongoing commitment to introduce the TommyNow concept to new audiences globally. 

  The Spring 2018 TommyXGigi collection celebrates speed , from Tommy’s love of motor sports to Gigi’s fast-paced lifestyle.  Bold, playful and relaxed , it is inspired by Gigi’s own effortless twist on athleisure style. Timeless classics, including oversized outerwear, tailored jeans, sporty active wear, and feminine dresses are reimagined in leather, luxe silks and distressed denim. Athletic color blocking in red, white and blue is enhanced with a signature Gigi racing stripe print, graphic badges and embroidered speed logos. Gold zipper details and contrasting stitching and piping add that extra finishing touch. A play on layers mismatches oversized pieces with super-skinny designs for a strong and confident new take on racetrack style. 

 “The spring 2018 TommyXGigi collection is inspired by speed and racing, combining my love of motor sports with Gigi’s signature cool twist on ath-leisure style,” Hilfiger said. “Collaborating with Gigi has been an amazing journey, and we’re thrilled to present our collection, designed with the next generation of fashion-forward ‘Tommy Girls’ in mind.” 

 For her part, Hadid contended that “Every capsule collection that Tommy and I have designed together mixes my personal style with the brand’s Americana heritage,” said Gigi Hadid. “The Spring 2018 designs are completely different from anything else we have created, and I can’t wait to see fans around the world put their unique twist on each look.”&nbsp;

				<meta property="og:title" content="'FRIDA KAHLO. BEYOND THE MYTH.' A NEW EXHIBITION IN MILAN">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" No guts, no glory.  Frida Kahlo  certainly had both. A woman of substance ahead of her time, and a formidable artist whose undisputable creative genius is emphasized in an exhibition housed inside  Milan’s MUDEC museum designed by David Chipperfield . It runs through June 3. With its mix of oils, drawings, watercolors, letters and photographs, the show is  the most important European exhibition  ever devoted to the most famous and  acclaimed Mexican female painter.  

 A seductive, trailblazing and opinionated feminist, Kahlo continues to woo fans even 110 years after her birth. The exhibition also showcases how Kahlo was  a political activist  and how her longtime lover and partner Diego Rivera, with whom she had a turbulent relationship, influenced her art. Another aspect that emerges is that besides expressing herself dramatically in her painting, Kahlo was also extremely  fearless, witty and ironical . 

 Her signature bold fashion tastes, carefully-assembled look and unconventional beauty were just as unique – jet black braids, piercing charcoal eyes, the monobrow, fresh flowers in her hair, touches of lace and exotic flouncy dresses. Often, they were used to hide the many scars on her body derived from the crippling bus accident that forced her in bed for months, from which she never recovered entirely, but which decreed the beginning of her artistic career. 

 As one of the 20th century’s most prominent artistic figures, Kahlo donned brightly colored and intricately patterned fabrics, including embroidered  Tehuana dresses  and  Huipil blouses , which have inspired legions of designers. Following her death in 1954, at the age of 47, her clothes were kept locked up and opened to the public only in 2004. Most were already familiar having appeared in countless portraits of Kahlo. They are housed inside her lifelong Mexican home,  La Casa Azul,  today the  Frida Kahlo Museum.&nbsp;

				<meta property="og:title" content="SUPER EXCLUSIVE: BURBERRY CUSTOMIZED WINDOWS ONLY @ ANTONIA TO CELEBRATE THE 'REISSUED' CAPSULE ">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>For a straight-off-the-runway privilege, <strong>Antonia Milano</strong> is among a handful of selected retailers worldwide to carry the exclusive <strong>Burberry capsule collection of &amp;ldquo;Reissued&amp;rdquo; archival pieces</strong> presented on Saturday as part of <strong>Christopher Bailey&amp;rsquo;s</strong> <strong>farewell show</strong> for the storied British brand.</p>

<p>Alongside the <strong>main F/W 2018-19 collection</strong> that strutted down the runway, Bailey created a series of reissue from the Eighties and Nineties when the name was still Burberrys. Vintage yet totally now, the <strong>unisex capsule </strong>spotlights Burberry&amp;rsquo;s signature plaid and the Rainbow check, the latest iteration of the house&amp;rsquo;s most defining pattern, designed as part of Bailey&amp;rsquo;s dedication of his last collection to LGBTQ+ communities. Alternatively, the checks appear in the shape of wool scarves, baseball caps, shirts, slides, shirts, plasticized bucket bags and, needless to say, on the trench, the house specialty par excellence.</p>

<p>In a worldwide exclusive, Antonia is the only retailer to boast a dedicated window display running from Feb. 19-23. Circular and graphic customized sculptures stand out against a patchwork of shredded fantasy and tartan wallpaper, highlighting each piece with standout inventiveness.</p>

<p>Emotional as all goodbye shows are, over <strong>1300 guests</strong>, fans and friends, including Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller, Chelsea Clinton, Naomi Watts, Michelle Dockery, Naomie Harris, Lily James and Daphne Guinness, flocked to the Dimco Buildings venue where Bailey held his swan-song show after 17 years as Creative Director. Called &amp;lsquo;Time&amp;rsquo;, it was presented against a multisensory installation that forms part of a new collaboration with United Visual Artists (UVA).</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;My final collection here at Burberry is dedicated to - and in support of - some of the best and brightest organizations supporting LGBTQ+ youth around the world.&amp;nbsp;There has never been a more important time to say that in our diversity lies our strength, and our creativity,&amp;rdquo; said Bailey. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>On the runway, a gaggle of models from the past and today such as Adwoa Aboah, Jean Campbell, Montell Martin and Edie Campbell &amp;ndash; who appeared in her first Burberry campaign in 2006 &amp;ndash; donned the clothes, a mash-up of periods, elements and designs. Cara Delevingne, discovered by Bailey over seven years ago, closed the show and led the finale as models walked under a spectrum of rainbow laser lights.</p>

<p>During his successful tenure at Burberry, Bailey transformed a dormant and over-exposed heritage brand into a multibillion-dollar business whose collections wooed a cult following seeking that cool Brit edge and attitude which he delivered to stellar status by injecting new life into Burberry&amp;rsquo;s most distinctive features.&amp;nbsp;</p>

For the 300-date event that will bring him across five continents, John has teamed up with  Gucci  for his onstage wardrobe. It’s no surprise that the 70-year-old singer chose the Italian luxurygoods house as he is a close friend of  Gucci Creative Director Alessandro Michele . The British rockstar, whose unparalleled career has redefined the cultural landscape, is a huge fan of Michele’s over-the-top designs, which fully mirror his eccentric, irreverent and ornate fashion tastes. 

 John, who is married to David Furnish, and has two sons Zachary, 7, and Elijah, 5, wants to dedicate more time to his family. 

 “Performing live fuels me and I’m ecstatic and humbled to continue to play to audiences across the globe,” said John. “I plan to bring the passion and creativity that has entertained my fans for decades to my final tour. After the tour finishes, I’m very much looking forward to closing that chapter of my life and to dedicate more time to raising my children.”

		<meta property="og:description" content=" French luxurygoods giant  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton  reported a  record 2017  with  net profit up 29 percent to 5.1 billion euros  and  annual revenues of 42.6 billion euros , a 13 percent jump compared to the previous year. The exponential growth comes from the group’s fashion and retailing divisions, led by star brand  Louis Vuitton  and by  Dior , the number two house, also spurred by the acquisition of Christian Dior Couture last year. 

 Another brand that posted excellent results is Bulgari, followed by Fendi, while Loro Piana, Céline, Loewe and Kenzo registered a steady progress. 

 “LVMH achieved another record year. The excellent performance, to which all our businesses contributed, is due in part to the buoyant environment but above all to the remarkable creative strength of our brands and their ability to constantly reinvent themselves. In an environment that remains uncertain, we can count on the appeal of our brands and agility of our teams to strengthen, once again in 2018, our leadership in the universe of high quality products,” said  Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer . 

 He touted Louis Vuitton as the top brand whose stellar performance and desirability is the fruit of a savvy balance between tradition and innovation and by the blockbuster collaborations with artist Jeff Koons and skateboard brand Supreme. 

 Arnault also painted a rosy future for Céline, where the arrival of&nbsp;Hedi Slimane this month, is expected to generate a bullish growth over the next five years, fueled by new product categories such as men’s wear, couture and fragrances.

A Central Saint Martin graduate, Jones joined the LVMH-owned brand as  men’s artistic   director in 2011 . He is credited for having injected a younger yet understated vibe into Louis Vuitton’s &nbsp;unique heritage via inspirations that derived from his extensive travels, love for the exotic and passion for wildlife, coupled with his unique ability to bridge luxury and streetwear edge. 

 Also of note are his hyper successful collaborations with skateboard brand  Supreme  and with artists  Dinos and Jake Chapman . 

 Jones took to Instagram to thank his team and collaborators. “Thank you&nbsp;@louisvuitton&nbsp;for 7 wonderful years! You really have been the best and I am grateful to&nbsp;@themarcjacobs&nbsp;for giving me the opportunity to be here in the first place ! I also want to thank Michael Burke for being so great and believing in me and Delphine Arnault for her support,” he wrote. 

 To show their support, a clutch of high-profile stars turned out for Jones’ final farewell show - Gwendoline Christie, Xavier Dolan, Brazilian soccer champion&nbsp;Neymar Jr., Dior’s&nbsp;Maria Grazia Chiuri,&nbsp;Stefano Pilati,&nbsp;the Beckham clan, Olivier Rousteing and Virgil Abloh. 

 His successor is yet to be named. The most recent rumors have alluded to the fact that Versace has been in talks with Jones. Also, Burberry is still seeking a replacement for Christopher Bailey, who will leave the British brand at the end of March.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" In an unexpected move, buzzy French designer  Hedi Slimane  was named  Artistic Director of Céline  starting on Feb 1. The story was first reported by WWD. 

 Slimane, considered one of the hottest trend-setters and image-makers in the fashion industry, replaces  Phoebe Philo  who resigned from the storied French brand in December after a blockbuster 10-year tenure. As part of a new vision, Slimane will expand the LVMH-owned Céline to include  men’s wear, couture and fragrance . His first effort for men and women will be unveiled  in September  during  Paris Fashion Week.  

 Joining Céline marks a homecoming of sorts for Slimane who made ripples in the industry as Dior Homme’s designer between 2000 and 2007. Both brands are owned by LVMH. Between 2012 and 2016, he added his touch to the house of Yves Saint Laurent, which is owned by the Kering Group. 

 According to WWD, Céline’s sales are quickly approaching one billion euros with ambitious plans to double the figure thanks to Slimane’s global cult following, digital push, and a wider assortment of products. 

 Phoebe Philo exits the house founded  by Céline Vipiana in 1945  after having transformed it into a buzzy luxurious label filled with minimal designs, sleek tailoring and cool leather for self-confident power women. Slimane is bound to bring a younger and more music-inspired vibe to the brand.&nbsp;

The player named his latest project House 99 because of the team spirit that the name evokes and highlights  1999 , the year that marks a turning point in his life, both personally and professionally, when he married Victoria Beckham, had his first son, Brooklyn, and won the treble with Manchester United. All the House 99 products are  tailored-made  according to Beckham’s own needs. Cases in point are the  Bold Statement , a tattoo body moisturizer with an SPF 30 that helps preserve their original colors. With his 40-plus tattoos, Beckham would know. 

 Many hair products are informed by the many cool hairstyles sported by Beckham, from shaved to quiffed. The range includes gels, pomades, balms and waxes, treated to resist humidity and sweat. Besides moisturizers, scrubs and cleansers, the line also includes special balms for beards. All, packaged in sleek and timeless black and white boxes. 

 Social media will obviously play a key role in upping House 99’s sense of community, as well as generating buzz and hype on new roll outs.&nbsp;

 Philo joined Céline in 2008, after taking a three-year hiatus, following a successful stint at Chloé.

 For Spring 2018, Philo was in a joyful and playful mood, inspired by nature with a collection that included plenty of outerwear/outdoor such as leather ponchos and trenches with ultra- long hems. The designer also revisited men’s tailoring with oversized jackets, boxy shapes with dangling strips and a handsome navy trench dress.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content=" The  Kan I is Fendi’s  latest hit bag, a whimsical novelty style that immediately peaked to the top of fashion’s Mount Olympus. 

 In various sizes, from  micro to maxi , the  Kan I is a boxy, stud-locked flap bag  that seamlessly melds functionality, creativity and modernity in quintessential Fendi style. 

 Thanks to its compact and contemporary silhouette, the Kan I adds zing to any look, on any occasion. Just as hot is the  Kan I F,  featuring the new F logo, a circular element in differently colored metal, inserted in the flap. 

 Initially available in plain leather with scalloped edges, it later received the Fendi treatment with a smattering of  embellishments  and  eye-catching mixes of details , colors, materials and workmanships, the kind that Fendi masters so well. For sure, the bursts of floral prints, leather flowers, bows, studs, applications, signature Pequin stripes, precious exotics and metallized lamé that decorate the frontal flap are the hard-to-resist kind of details that really make a difference. 

 Moreover, the Rainbow Studs, the square-shaped studs that have become the house’s latest signature detail, are reworked to become a novelty lock closure, at once decorative and functional. &nbsp; 

 Thanks to their sliding chain, both the Kan I and Mini Kan I can transition from shoulder to top handle bag. The small metal rings allow for personalization thanks to the  Strap You and Mini Strap You  as additional handles, as well as any kind of bag charms to add playfulness and personality. 

 It’s no surprise then that the Kan has become the new obsession among young and cool women seeking a bag with an edgy twist that expresses their personality yet crafted according to the highest forms of tradition and totally functional. 

 Among the Kan I fans are Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Miranda Kerr, Chiara Ferragni and Anna dello Russo.

				<meta property="og:title" content="CALVIN KLEIN SIGNS COLLABORATION WITH THE ANDY WARHOL FOUNDATION">
		<meta property="og:description" content="  Calvin Klein , Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH Corp, has inked a  multi-year partnership with The   Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts . The global deal, effective through 2020, grants unprecedented access to the artist’s works, including many unpublished ones, and will extend to various licensing projects across the Calvin Klein brand portfolio. 

 Warhol, who died in 1987, is considered one of the most influential figures in contemporary art and culture. His Campbell’s Soup cans and Brillo boxes, as well as his portraits of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson, John Lennon and Liza Minelli, are trans-generational icons that defined a very specific cultural period. 

 “I am proud that through this licensing agreement with The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Calvin Klein will be continuing its longstanding commitment to the celebration of American artists and their prolific work,” said Steve Shiffman, Chief Executive Officer, Calvin Klein, Inc. “I look forward to the global rollout of this partnership across multiple levels of the Calvin Klein consumer experience.” 

 “I’ve come to realize that Warhol’s genius goes much deeper than cheerful Campbell’s Soup paintings,” said Raf Simons, Chief Creative Officer at Calvin Klein. “He captured all sides of the American experience, including sometimes its darker sides. Warhol’s art tells more truths about this country than you can find almost anywhere else.” &nbsp; 

 Michael Dayton Hermann, Director of Licensing at the Warhol Foundation, added that “Warhol’s legacy is not limited to the tremendous influence of his timeless concepts but also through the work of the foundation he established, which has become one of the pre-eminent funders of contemporary art having distributed over $275 million in grants since inception,” he said. “We are proud that Raf’s visionary work at Calvin Klein will unabashedly embrace all facets of Warhol’s work and generously contribute to the foundation’s endowment.”&nbsp; 

 The first iteration of the partnership was unveiled in September 2017 at Simons’ Spring 2018 Calvin Klein runway show. Various pieces, in fact, featured Warhol artworks as placement screen prints, perfectly mirroring the collection’s inspirations of cinema, the dream factory of Hollywood and its depictions of both an American nightmare and the all-powerful American dream. 

 Warhol’s links to fashion date back to the Seventies when the artist befriended a fresh generation of New York designers that included Calvin Klein himself. Klein had set out to capture a new, truly American essence in his creations, a mantra that perfectly meshed with Warhol’s own interests. 

 Today, three decades later, Simons is renewing the relationship between the house of Calvin Klein and the greatest of American artists. Thanks to The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Simons has been forging what he views as a deep, thoroughgoing collaboration with the undying genius of Warhol, built on the creative ideals that they share. &nbsp;

				<meta property="og:title" content="FEATURE PERFECT: A TALK WITH MICHAEL HALPERN">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" ‘Tis the season to dress up and there’s nothing more high-glam than a dose of sparkle to flash things up during the holidays. But for  Michael Halpern , founder and designer of  Halpern Studio, “shine ,  sparkle and shimmer”  is a year-round affair. Launched at London Fashion Week for the F/W 2017-18 season, this buzzy new brand is all about unabashed glamour, hyper femininity and over-the-top embellishments infused with a Disco-54-meets-couture-atelier vibe. 

 Certainly, Halpern’s labor-intensive, Made in England sequin-smothered numbers in tulle, organza and satin, aren’t for the wallflower types. Think more along the lines of Katy Perry, Marion Cotillard, Amal Clooney, Kate Moss, Rita Ora and Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, all major aficionados. 

 The past year has been an adrenalin-charged flurry of events for Halpern, one that culminated with the 2017 British Awards honor for British Emerging Talent. 

 “ I had always wanted to complete a Master's at CSM, so after working a few years in New York, I decided to move on to London to do my masters. London is the place where Halpern began and is my home now, ” says the designer. &nbsp; 

 The 29-year old New Yorker who graduated from Parsons School of Design with a BFA in fashion design in 2010, was admitted to the Masters program at Central Saint Martins in London. In between, he cut his teeth at J. Mendel and Oscar de la Renta and is currently a consultant for the Atelier Versace couture collections. The young designer shuttles between London, where he is now based, and Milan for his collaboration with Donatella Versace.&nbsp; 

 Here, in his words, Halpern offers some insight on his high-octane success story.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; 

 &nbsp; 

 What spurred you to enter the fashion world? 

  My mother's epic stories of the 70's and the women I grew up around.&nbsp;  

 &nbsp; 

 How would you describe your aesthetic? 

  Unapologetic hedonistic glamour with a nod to classical couture techniques  

 &nbsp; 

 How labor-intensive are your clothes? 

  Each Halpern piece is unique and comes with its own level of complexity. I want to keep experimenting and having fun with the collections as we grow.&nbsp; The entire process from start to finish is so exciting for me and my team.&nbsp; From initial developments to fittings, and ultimately the show; the full process is so exhilarating and new.  

 &nbsp; 

 Which are the most valuable aspects of your collaboration with Donatella? 

  Working with&nbsp;Donatella was amazing, I’ve never met someone who has such a laser-focus of her brand – she lives it, she is it. It was such an honor to be in Italy and see how couture works. I loved spending time there, everyone lives in the same area, everyone works together, goes out together every night. Lunch is a proper lunch. The whole experience was amazing and so lovely to be welcomed by such a knowledgeable&nbsp;and nice team.&nbsp;  

 &nbsp; 

 What is escapism for you?&nbsp; 

  The world is a little bit gloomy and dark at the moment, so escapism for me is being optimistic, happy and fun, however that happens!&nbsp;I think having an optimistic viewpoint on fashion right now is completely necessary in the world we live in.&nbsp; We need that escapism, and fashion can truly provide it.

 True to Moncler’s heritage, the palette revolves around the brand’s French flag  blue, white and red,  interpreted with a standout linearity for a renewed appeal. Overall, though, all the pieces are co-branded with names and symbols of both Moncler and Kith. The footwear is as sturdy as it is stylish with plenty of hiking models or shearling-lined shoes and trainers.&nbsp;

<p>Casta&amp;ntilde;er was founded in 1927 by Luis Casta&amp;ntilde;er and his cousin Tom&amp;agrave;s Serra. During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Spain&amp;#39;s Republican government nationalized the company, because espadrilles were regarded as a product of military interest. Soldiers were sent to fight at the front wearing&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;seven-ribbon espadrilles.&amp;quot; In the early 70s, they crafted the first wedge espadrille for a young up-and-coming Yves Saint Laurent. Ever since, Casta&amp;ntilde;er has been attracting top fashion houses for customized espadrilles.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>His career-long imagery will be showcased in <strong>nine different rooms</strong>, each with groups of photos selected with Vogue Italia senior fashion editor <strong>Alessia Glaviano</strong>, that highlight Roversi&amp;rsquo;s striking lighting techniques. Thanks to his use of natural window light, interpreted with sensual moody chiaroscuro effects, Roversi is considered one the best photographers of our time. He also stood out from the pack by using <strong>8&amp;times;10</strong> <strong>Polaroid film</strong>.</p>

<p>To describe his photography, Roversi often cites Nadar, at the beginning of photography: &amp;ldquo;Everyone can learn the technique of lighting. What is very difficult, and what you can&amp;rsquo;t teach is a feeling for the light, a sentiment of the light.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Roversi certainly has plenty of sentiment and affinity with light, opting for a dimmed feel that has created erotic and sensual imagery always infused with a poetic vision.</p>

<p>While for decades, his work has graced the most important magazines worldwide, &amp;ldquo;Storie&amp;rdquo; also shows Roversi&amp;rsquo;s lesser-known experimental and artsy side. An entire room, in fact, is dedicated to unpublished photos of Rihanna.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Not one to play by the rules, what counts for Lorenzo is the cool factor obtained with a signature hip-hop-meets sporty vibe. His Fear of God cult label is best known for ready-to-wear styles that highlight small yet edgy details, designed to fit in just about anyone&amp;rsquo;s wardrobe. F.O.G. is Lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s youthful and affordable iteration of the Fear of God aesthetic.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, who has an MBA and didn&amp;rsquo;t attend fashion schools, takes his cue from vintage stores and flea markets, attracting the likes of Justin Bieber, Russell Westbrook, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" The prestigious annual  Footwear News Achievement Awards  will be held on Nov. 28 at the IAC Building in Manhattan, honoring the boldest and brightest fashion designers, both established and rising, hot influencers, visionaries and cool shoe brands. Key industry players who have forged or will shape the footwear scene. 

 Among the many awards of the event, the Shoe of the Year goes to  Virgil Abloh’s  rendition of the Air Jordan 1 while  Gianvito Rossi  is Designer of the Year. Both  Alexa Chung  and  Attico  will receive the Launch of the Year award and  Hailey Baldwin  will be crowned Style Influencer of the Year.&nbsp; 

 For sure, the tough-to-get, limited-edition version of Abloh’s Air Jordan 1 sneaker, which is part of “The Ten Reconstructed” project developed with Nike, has sent the market in a turmoil. Bella Hadid, Roger Federer, Cristiano Ronaldo, Drake, Wiz Khalifa, Tom Sachs, and Travis Scott are just a few of the high-wattage names spotted wearing the kick.&nbsp;

				<meta property="og:title" content="THE 'JIL SANDER.PRESENT TENSE' RETROSPECTIVE ">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" For many  Jil Sander  is the Queen of less is less. Her unmistakable clean and lean aesthetic, which anticipated and defined an era, is now on display in a retrospective called  “Jil Sander. Present Tense.”  The title couldn’t be more appropriate for a designer who doesn’t like to look back and whose clothes are strikingly up to date. 

 Showcased at  Frankfurt’s Museum for Applied Art , the exhibition fans out over three floors, covering 32,000 square feet, filled with opens spaces, stairs, ramps and smooth angles. 

 The stark, all white and light-flooded space is peppered with clothes, accessories, fragrances, memento and imagery that make up the designer’s trailblazing  50-year career.  None, however, come with a date. Completing the installation are macro and micro digital screens, larger-than-life photos, and video screens that pull the visitors into various shows, as if they were part of it. 

 The show marks the first exhibition dedicated to the German designer, who founded her namesake label  in 1968 in Hamburg,  Germany, and staged her  first fashion show in 1975 in Paris . She quickly scaled the ladder of success with her pristine, modernist and beautifully tailored pieces, made from prized or cutting-edge fabrics. In her idea of purism and perfect her proportions, she channeled a lot of energy in the research of exclusive textiles. 

 Considered a forerunner of minimalism, the petite, reclusive and soft-spoken designer has always shunned any form of limelight. And still does today. Because in the end, it’s her creations that do the talking.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Call it the <strong>Dior </strong>Italian power. Creating a major stir, <strong>LVMH Mo&amp;euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton</strong> appointed <strong>Pietro Beccari</strong> as <strong>chief executive officer of&amp;nbsp;Christian Dior&amp;nbsp;Couture</strong>, succeeding <strong>Sidney Toledano</strong>, who will become executive chairman of the <strong>LVMH Fashion Group.</strong></p>

<p>Beccari will join <strong>Maria Grazia Chiuri</strong>, the first-ever woman to be appointed <strong>Creative Director</strong> at the legendary fashion house. She joined in July 2016, succeeding Raf Simons.</p>

<p>The 66-year-old Toledano, who is close to <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, chairman and chief executive officer of&amp;nbsp;LVMH&amp;nbsp;Mo&amp;euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, will hand over the baton to Beccari early next year, after almost 20 years at the helm of Christian&amp;nbsp;Dior&amp;nbsp;Couture. Moving into the next chapter of his professional career, Toledano will replace Pierre-Yves Roussel as chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group.</p>

<p>The top brass of C&amp;eacute;line, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Rossi Moda and Nicholas Kirkwood will report to Toledano.</p>

<p>An excellent leader with a strong vision and people&amp;rsquo;s skills, Beccari did an outstanding job at Fendi, which he helped transform into a billion-euro company with an innovative vision and stimulating projects that include less logo and more upscale products, often injected with a dose of humour, sprawling new headquarters, a boutique hotel and Zuma restaurant.</p>

<p>Dior is celebrating its 70th&amp;nbsp;anniversary this year with events including a retrospective at Les Arts D&amp;eacute;coratifs in Paris with stellar attendance.</p>

The showcase included creations that revisited the feminine illustrations from the divinatory cards that inspired Dior&amp;rsquo;s Creative Director Maria Grazia Chiuri for the season.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The tarots of Karen Vogel and Vicki Noble are powerful, they are the artistic expression of a feminism capable of healing and strengthening. I wanted to reuse them with a pop spirit. These tarots are linked to the star signs, also dear to Monsieur Dior.

				<meta property="og:title" content="CHRISTOPHER BAILEY TO LEAVE BURBERRY">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" Sending ripples through the fashion industry,  Christopher Bailey ,  President and Chief Creative Officer of Burberry,  announced he will resign in  2018.  

 Under the stewardship of  Marco Gobbetti , who joined the British luxury house as  Ceo  in July 2017,  Burberry is ready to enter a new decade .&nbsp;Bailey’s decision marks the end of an era as the star designer gets ready to pursue new creative projects after he will step down from the Burberry board on March 31, 2018. 

 Gobbetti is now in charge of finding a successor, although there should be no shortage of candidates for the role that’s been filled by one of the longest-serving creative directors in fashion. 

 Since he joined in 2001, Bailey was instrumental in transforming  the 161-year-old brand  from a dusty raincoat specialist steeped in tradition to a major fashion player listed on the London Stock Exchange. He reinvented the iconic tartan pattern to contemporary and edgy effect, complete with girly flourishes, handsome tailoring and military touches, created new IT bags and distilled the cool British spirit in a unique way. 

 He also moved forward by teaming up with hot and plugged-in  Russian streetwear designer   and photographer &nbsp; Gosha Rubchinskiy  as part of Burberry's&nbsp;Here We Are&nbsp;exhibition, which explores British culture. The buzzy eight-piece collection, which&nbsp;was unveiled alongside his namesake S/S 2018 range in Saint Petersburg, includes reversible bombers, shirts, shorts and bucket hats, all&nbsp;featuring Burberry’s famous check pattern. 

 During his tenure, Bailey guided the company through smooth and troubled waters, switched to see-now-buy-now shows and blazed new trails when he entered the digital world ahead of his competitors. 

 According to the media, there is wide speculation that Céline’s creative director Phoebe Philo or Clare Waight Keller, artistic director at Givenchy, could take on the role. 

 Looking ahead, it seems that Gobbetti and top analysts believe that Burberry needs to evolve by taking more risks and by experimenting to ultimately create a new energy.&nbsp;

				<meta property="og:title" content="PURPLE MAGAZINE CELEBRATES 25 YEARS AT THE FOREFRONT">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>For 25 years <strong>Purple Magazine</strong> has been connecting art and fashion and still today remains a pillar of contemporary fashion.</p>

<p>Marking this special milestone is an <strong>anniversary issue</strong> of 25 different covers, including amateur erotic photographer John Kayser, that celebrate the <strong>artists and models</strong> who incarnated the spirit of the magazine through their style, attitude, and personality. They include Cindy Sherman, Richard Prince, Paul McCarthy, Mich&amp;egrave;le Lamy, Susan Cianciolo, Stella and Eva, Amanda Wall, Maurizio Cattelan, Paul Hameline and many more.</p>

<p>In a tribute to <strong>modeling as a form of art</strong> with muses who truly inspire designers, photographers, stylists and editors, each cover girl tells a quarter century story. They include supermodels Eva Herzigova and Stella Tennant; Nineties icons like Guinevere, Alek Wek, and Chlo&amp;euml; Sevigny; the faces of the new millennium such as Jamie Bochert, Saskia de Brauw, and Anja Rubik; new-generation talents including Tamy Glauser, Anna Cleveland, Rila Fukushima and Sky Ferreira; plus, emerging supermodels Slick Woods, Kiki Willems and Grace Hartzel.</p>

<p>Founded in 1992 by Olivier Zahm, still editor-in-chief, and Elein Fleiss, Purple emerged as a fashion reaction known as &amp;ldquo;anti-fashion&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;grunge&amp;rdquo; that countered the late-Eighties power dressing and in-your-face glamour. With it came a wave of new girls, new faces and new ways of posing in front of camera. In other words, more freedom, spontaneity and open sexuality.</p>

<p>According to the magazine in an online preface, still today models are artists in their own right who create a legitimate bond between an attitude and the clothes. Through an intuitive communication with a photographer, the model is the co-creator of a picture. The art of modeling is not about simply looking good in front of a camera, finding the best profile and attitude, having fun and looking sexy. Enough of that is on Instagram. There is no school for modeling, no repertoire of poses. A good model is someone who instinctively reinvents modeling from A to Z.</p>

<p>In that light, Purple makes it clear how it has always preferred models who are &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; psychologically and emotionally, encouraging them to be who they are and to engage with the camera, dressed or not, and to do so without falling into conventions. Another way to break the rules is to revisit modeling in intimate ways, such as having the model shot by a lover. Very effective.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="EXCLUSIVE: THE 'TEN ICONS RECONSTRUCTED' PROJECT BY OFF-WHITE™ X NIKE INC.">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p><em>With <strong>&amp;ldquo;Ten Icons Reconstructed,&amp;rdquo; Nike and Off-White&amp;rsquo;s Virgil Abloh</strong> have written a new chapter in the story of icons revisited.</em></p>

<p><em>Setting the craze ablaze are 10 super successful Nike sneakers that Abloh has reconstructed with his edgy fashion touch that draws from the world of architecture. </em></p>

<p>The shoes are divided into two themes. The first, &amp;ldquo;<strong>REVEALING&amp;rdquo;</strong> includes the Air Jordan I, Nike Air Max 90, Nike Air Presto, Nike Air VaporMax and Nike Blazer Mid, designed to bare all as in taken apart and reconstructed.</p>

<p>The second is <strong>&amp;ldquo;GHOSTING&amp;rdquo;</strong> featuring translucent uppers that stand for the idea of revealing, creating a common thread that runs through the Nike Zoom Fly SP, Nike Air Force 1 Low, Nike React Hyperdunk, Nike Air Max 97 and Converse Chuck Taylor (release postponed to 2018).</p>

<p>Both groups come in a tight palette of black and white with pops of red and orange.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;What we&amp;#39;re talking about here is larger than sneakers, it&amp;rsquo;s larger than design culture,&amp;rdquo; says Virgil Abloh. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s nothing short of state-of-the-art design. These 10 shoes have broken barriers in performance and style. To me, they are on the same level as a sculpture of David or the&amp;nbsp;<em>Mona Lisa</em>. You can debate it all you want, but they mean something. And that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s important.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>For this high-profile project, Abloh merged his early design education, drawn from athletic footwear, hip-hop and rock album covers and graffiti, with formal training in architecture and engineering. Now a successful creative director, DJ, designer and founder of the OFF-WHITE brand, Abloh blurs the lines of various creative processes, rewriting the rules of fashion and design by injecting humor and DIY elements into his aesthetic.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;My high school years were made up of playing soccer, skateboarding and biking year-round,&amp;rdquo; says Abloh. &amp;ldquo;What I&amp;#39;ve learned from playing sports and also being obsessed with design is that there is an inherent style and focus that exists amongst athletes and designers alike: What propels them to be the best comes from deep&amp;nbsp;within.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Abloh&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Nike began long before his first visit to the company&amp;rsquo;s Oregon headquarters in October 2016 to start a new collaboration. As an Illinois-based teenager, he and his friends sent shoe ideas to Nike. &amp;ldquo;We were enamored with Air Jordans,&amp;rdquo; contends the 36-year-old Abloh who is now based between Milan and Chicago. &amp;ldquo;Michael Jordan was larger than life &amp;mdash; he was Superman to me. My entire design background and ethos came from the &amp;lsquo;90s.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Combining this reconstructed design language with Abloh&amp;rsquo;s urgency to fulfill a life-long dream ultimately led to The Ten, a collaborative exploration of 10 Nike footwear silhouettes.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;Most of the creative decisions were made in the first three hours, while actual design and iteration took two to three days,&amp;rdquo; recalls Abloh. &amp;ldquo;With the Jordan I was done in one design session.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>As always, <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong> knows how to leave a mark. For his latest collaboration with Nike, the renowned designer created a capsule collection called <strong>Victorious Minotaurs</strong> and reimagined the basketball-inspired <strong>NikeLab Air Force 1 High x RT</strong> men&amp;#39;s shoe which pay homage to the hardwood&amp;#39;s elite athletes. For the apparel, Tisci imagined a fictitious new squad, borne from his obsession with hardwood heritage, outfitted in luxe staples including an Oxford shirt, track pants and a varsity jacket, all adorned with distinctive and eye-catching details that mix sports, streets and style.<br />
<br />
The most distinctive trait of the kick in tonal-stitched premium leather is a <strong>large star</strong> behind the leather Swoosh followed by a signature RT and Swoosh embroidered patch on the forefoot and Tisci&amp;rsquo;s initials on the midsole. A retro-style ankle strap adds the perfect finishing touch. The Air Force One was named after the aircraft that carries the U.S. President. An icon since 1982, it continues to cement its status from the hardwood to hip-hop culture while staying true to its roots with soft and springy cushioning.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Dynasty is the brainchild of Sallie Patrick and duo Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage of &amp;ldquo;Gossip Girl&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The O.C.&amp;rdquo; with costume designer <strong>Meredith Markworth-Pollack</strong> working plenty of high-drama and over-the-top fashion statements just like in the original one. Sans the power dressing, bold shoulders and blown-out hair dos, the clothes obviously reference the current times with luxury brands such as Marc Jacobs, Balmain, Saint Laurent, Christian Louboutin, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and heaps of Gucci at the forefront. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the cast, Grant Show is Blake Carrington, Elizabeth Gillies stars as Fallon Carrington, Blake&amp;rsquo;s ambitious and headstrong daughter, while Nathalie Kelley plays Cristal, Blake&amp;rsquo;s lover. Alan Dale perfectly steps into the role of Anders, Blake&amp;rsquo;s opinionated butler. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Once again, the boundary-pushing singer has explored new musical grounds in the <strong>R&amp;amp;B arena</strong>, also thanks to longtime collaborators such as Bok Bok&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Jam City, plus trailblazing producers like&amp;nbsp;Total Freedom&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Arca, who helped her shape the album&amp;rsquo;s sound. In Take Me Apart, Kelela opens up about her the intricacy of her relationships, from an ex to a new flame.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelela is also a fashion aficionado, most recently attending the Calvin Klein show and walking&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;Eckhaus Lattajust. The same way the looks of a brand reflect what it wants to say to the world, her new album says a lot about her emotions and how she feels about the world.&amp;nbsp;</p>

With a focused and in-control message, he infused the collection with the new <strong>gentleness and confidence</strong> that is currently ruling the men&amp;rsquo;s wear scene. Providing that exclusive extra twist, Piccioli asked <strong>Jamie Reid</strong>, the graphic designer who worked with the <strong>Sex Pistols</strong>, to come up with two slogans to use in his collection. The result is &amp;ldquo;Beauty is a birthright, reclaim your heritage&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;It seemed to be the end, until the next beginning.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Working punk as a state of mind rather than in obvious references, Piccioli also took his cue from images by iconoclastic artists such as <strong>Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Caravaggio</strong>, adding a collegiate-meets-gentlemanly feel to the line-up. The color palette is accentuated by pastel green, camel, rust and pink, further expressing a soft side and quiet flamboyance. A multitude of finely-executed ideas that flourish across the board, from shrunken tailored pieces to leather outerwear, from sporty tops to the hot new sneakers.&amp;nbsp;</p>

 Sources cited by the fashion newspaper say that the transaction was kept unusually quiet probably since Supreme’s founder  James Jebbia  was concerned that taking such a big check from private equity would ultimately impact the brand’s street credentials, “particularly in the U.K., where he was raised.” 

 Founded in 1994 by New York-born, British-raised Jebbia, Supreme has become of the hottest tickets on the fashion scene thanks to a focused strategy of exclusive drops that generate waiting lists; &nbsp;collaborations with high-end brands, including the latest one with Louis Vuitton; a well-defined image; a strong fashion message, plus heaps of celebrity status. 

 According to WWD, the transaction gave Supreme “an enterprise value of $1.1 billion, including $1 billion in equity and $100 million in debt.” 

 After Manhattan, the brand&nbsp;opened its second New York store, in Brooklyn.&nbsp;

<p>The Limited Edition <strong>&amp;ldquo;Invicta </strong>&amp;hearts;<strong> Antonia&amp;rdquo;</strong> backpack comes in three color combinations with navy blue matched to yellow, green and red as in the best Invicta tradition. Made from sturdy stone-washed nylon with vintage effect, each one is personalized with felt patches, a maxi logo and embroidery, plus <strong>&amp;ldquo;Invicta &amp;hearts; Antonia&amp;rdquo;</strong> strips.</p>

<p>Especially among teen-agers, backpacks are the perfect accessory with which to express one&amp;rsquo;s personality via writings, slogans, signatures and all sorts of visuals that make them unique. A sort of blank canvas that in the Eighties especially was the rage among students seeking to customize their backs, to share their dreams, to tell their stories. In many ways, an ahead-of-the-times social media outlet.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Founded in 1906 as a bag and sacs manufacturer, Invicta was a pioneer in the high-performing sports sector, starting in 1933 when it developed the first rigid frame backpack, originally designed for mountaineering expeditions. In 1938, Invicta invented and trademarked a patent for the modern belt pouch and, a few years later, during WWII, its backpacks and gaiters became standard military equipment. Between the Sixties and Seventies, it was the go-to brand for the most famous expeditions on the Himalaya, Alps and Andes.&amp;nbsp;In 1980, the lightweight, mountain-perfect Jolly style became an icon of urban style with a distinctive Italian flair.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Italian-born, London-based  Alessandra Rich  believes in being contemporary without bending to trends, a formula she masters brilliantly and effortlessly with the right dose of class and sass. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Convinced that “ conservatism is sexy and vice versa ,” this self-taught designer and avid art collector thinks that melding the two is more a question of attitude than balance.&nbsp; “I always believe that it is the woman that makes the difference,” she notes. 

 It’s no surprise then that her muses are of the Marie-Antoinette-meets-Kim-Kardashian variety with a roster of inspiring women that includes silver screen divas, Russian skaters, the Boldini woman and Eighties Soap Opera heroines. In short, a blend of  bag girls  and  bon ton ladies .&nbsp; 

 Her creative process is defined by many elements, from observation to experimentation, ultimately building a solid project infused with a sense, style and passion, of course. 

 The svelte and chic designer is particularly fascinated by the contemporary era for its capacity to change, for the energy it radiates and for its difficult interpretation. “In my collections, there are often elements of fascination that come from the past but that I always try to make contemporary,” she says. 

 Indeed. Her impeccably-fashioned collections brim with charm via colorful lace, hints of lamé, puffed sleeves, high necks, cascades of ruffles and prized materials, with a little drama and flash tossed in between. Rich creates the perfect all-occasion wardrobe for self-assured women both sexy and understated. In-control fashion aficionados that are never victims. Or, in her words, “A universal woman, intelligent, sure of herself, someone who enjoys fashion.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 Despite her success, Rich remains down-to-earth and hands-on in developing her collections, from sourcing textiles to overseeing the look books. Obviously, she is aware of the challenges in being a fashion designer today and what it takes to “maintain your identity without being boring.” “It’s important to reconsider your own rules as a designer, researching an equilibrium between creativity and product,” she stresses. &nbsp; 

 Driven by word-of-mouth success, over the years, Rich has become one of the go-to designers for A-listers with fans including Diane Kruger, Rihanna, Meryl Streep, Olivia Wilde and Adriana Lima. Pop diva Beyoncé wore an ornate white lace tiered dress in her controversial music video&nbsp; Formation .

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Two decades after&amp;nbsp;her brother&amp;nbsp;<strong>Gianni&amp;nbsp;Versace&amp;rsquo;s death in 1997</strong>, <strong>Donatella Versace</strong> payed tribute to his&amp;nbsp;creative genius and iconoclastic vision with a moving show and big-bang finale.</p>

<p>His superb artistry and virtuosity defined a new idea of <strong>sexy glamour and in-your-face flash</strong>, infused with a <strong>rock&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;roll attitude, </strong>and other still-relevant elements<strong>. </strong>First and foremost, his <strong>elaborate and upbeat signature prints </strong>that forged the house&amp;rsquo;s imagery. For spring, Donatella culled the archives and reworked his most famous designs -&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Baroque&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Vogue&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;My Friend Elton&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Warhol&amp;rdquo;, among others.</p>

<p>The finale created a real emotional moment, complete with a standing ovation. As a soft female voice announced, &amp;ldquo;Gianni this is for you,&amp;rdquo; five of his favorite Supermodels that go by their first names -&amp;nbsp;<strong>Naomi, Claudia, Cindy, Carla and Helena</strong> - closed the show clad in the lam&amp;eacute; dresses that Versace made famous.</p>

<p>Designers including Gucci&amp;rsquo;s Alessandro Michele, Pierpaolo Piccioli and Anthony Vaccarello also took in the scene, personally invited by Donatella. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Gianni&amp;rsquo;s genius lives on and always will.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="YVES SAINT LAURENT'S PARTNER PIERRE BERGE' DIES AT 86">
		<meta property="og:description" content="  Pierre Bergé , the longtime partner of&nbsp; Yves Saint Laurent ,  died at 86  at his home in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. 

  A leading figure in fashion, the arts and in politics , Bergè never shied from speaking him mind and creating controversy. His death comes just weeks before the inauguration of  two Yves Saint Laurent museums in Paris and Marrakech.  Two unique venues that will highlight the work and talent of the legendary couturier who passed away in 2008.&nbsp; 

 Known for his sharp tongue, tireless energy and ruthless attitude, Bergé was a visionary, a shrewd&nbsp; businessman and a patron of the arts who was deeply intertwined with the cultural world. He held many influential posts including being the co-owner of French newspaper Le Monde, the founder of AIDS charity Sidaction and the former president of the Paris Opera. 

 Bergé and Yves Saint Laurent founded the couture house in 1961, spearheading it until 2002. Over the decades they became one of fashion’s best-known power couples, creating one of the world’s most storied and celebrated labels.&nbsp; 

 Though polar opposite, he and Yves Saint Laurent were perfectly complementary, balancing their strengths and weaknesses ultimately creating a stability that lasted for over 40 years.&nbsp; 

 Together they enjoyed an elitist circle of friends that included a crop of influential artists, writers and politicians of the era, ranging from François Mitterrand to Jean Cocteau to Andy Warhol. 

  Bergé was born on l’Île d’Oléron, a French island off the Atlantic, on Nov. 14, 1930 . At 18 he moved to Paris where he met Saint Laurent at a dinner party hosted by Dior. 

 Shortly afterward, Saint Laurent took over as head designer of the house after Dior’s premature death in 1957. During Saint Laurent’s leave to serve in the army, he was replaced by Marc Bohan, so he and Bergé started their own label, unveiling their first collection in 1962 to stellar reviews. 

 As his success scaled to the highest rungs of the fashion ladder, Saint Laurent attracted a crop of high-profile clients including the  Duchess of Windsor, Catherine Deneuve, Lee Radziwill, Paloma Picasso, Jacqueline de Ribes, Lauren Bacall and Leslie Caron.&nbsp;  

 The couple split romantically in 1976, but Bergé and Saint Laurent continued to remain business partners and friends.

<p>Dacade found her calling at 14, when she purchased her first pair of shoes with her pocket money - red and blue striped ballerinas with a big bow. Voil&amp;agrave;, it was the beginning of a love affair that soon turned into a solid profession.</p>

<p>Eager to mix <strong>form and function</strong>, Dacade trained at the AFPIC School. Her understanding of construction, as well as her passion for feminine, sensual shoes, make her shoes sexy and comfortable. Because, as she puts it, there is &amp;quot;no need to suffer for beauty&amp;quot;.<br />
At once <strong>chic and funky, feminine and quirky</strong>, Dacade&amp;rsquo;s shoes are inspired by a melting pot of cultures. Always on the go, she reveals how watching people as they move through airports and train stations sparks her creativity.</p>

<p>Her collections, which she compares to a family, offer a wide range of styles, details and heights. &amp;ldquo;The shoes are not all the same. Some are sexy and tall, some are chunky and funky. But, like families, they all live under one roof,&amp;rdquo; she says.</p>

<p>Similarly, she believes that shoes express a woman&amp;rsquo;s mood since teetering around in 10-cm heels sets off a completely different attitude that walking around in flats.</p>

<p>&amp;quot;Shoes, like jewelry, are very sensual objects. My goal is to make shoes for Cinderella, but sexy, with a French touch, &amp;quot; muses Dacade.</p>

A highly-charged role that he mastered with <strong>a beautiful</strong> and <strong>calm</strong> yet <strong>strong</strong> and <strong>powerful</strong> collection for both men and women.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Rising to expectations, Simons dipped into the star-and-striped culture, a message reinforced by the fact that he commissioned artist <strong>Sterling Ruby</strong> to imagine America in an art installation. Simons imagined his own America and drew from its youth, often with gender neutrality.</p>

<p>Simon&amp;rsquo;s opted for Klein&amp;rsquo;s <strong>less-is-more tailoring of the Nineties</strong>, producing a collection that reaches out to a broad age bracket. There is an abundance of buttoned-up shirts in contrasting hues tucked into sharp trousers; all-over denim and handsome precisely-tailored coats. At times, he added a layer of transparent plastic over the outerwear.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="  PUMA  continues  full-steam ahead with a robust growth in the second quarter of 2017 . Sales surged  16.3%  adjusted to currencies to  € 968.7 million  with all regions contributing to the double-digit hike. Footwear continued to be the main driver, followed by apparel. 

  Net earnings &nbsp;ballooned from € 1.6 million to € 21.9 million and&nbsp; earnings per share &nbsp;stood at € 1.46 compared to € 0.11 in the second quarter of last year. 

 “In another positive quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in all regions and in both footwear and apparel. This combined with a good sell-through in retail and a good orderbook for the next quarters made us raise the outlook for the full year. We now expect a currency adjusted sales growth for the full year between 12% and 14% and a full-year EBIT between € 205 million and 215 million,”  says Bjørn Gulden, Chief Executive Officer of PUMA SE.  Since he joined in 2013, the&nbsp;&nbsp; executive has been pivotal in Puma’s turnaround.&nbsp; 

 In the same period, the Kering-owned sportswear giant also posted three major wins in football with Arsenal FC winning the FA Cup, BVB Borussia Dortmund securing the DFB cup and Chivas winning Mexican championship. In the same period, Puma introduced its new lacing technology NETFIT across performance and sportstyle footwear. 

 With its mix of sports stars and celebrities such as Rihanna, Kylie Jenner and Cara Delevingne, Puma is on target for a better-than-expected blockbuster year.&nbsp;

<p>Often rumpled, checks and plaids in all sizes rule, appearing in anything from slim coats and slouchy pants tinged in autumnal sparks of burnt orange, saffron yellow and moss green. Shaggy and textured furs are tossed over colorfully striped knits and suits cut with a laid-back pajama feel.</p>

His cult pieces, in fact, sell out like hot cakes. The New-York-based designer’s latest collection, which debuted in Paris, is called “For You, The World” and comprises of a range of Tees, fleeces, padded bomber jackets, fluid sweat pants and fanny packs. Inspired by the colors of the Heron, a long-legged freshwater and coastal bird with 64 different species, the palette also includes touches of neon orange. Besides the season’s bird design, there are a number of key pieces featuring the Russian word for “style” written in Cyrillic. 

  Heron Preston , who has collaborated with Nike and Kanye West, made his fashion foray with a small collection for Fall/Winter 2017 developed in collaboration with  New York City’s Department of Sanitation.  

 Fascinated by uniforms, and eager to make the earth a better and cleaner place, the Made in Italy Tees and fleeces with screen-printed  DSNY branding  and  archival designs  are made with  upcycled and donated pieces  from sanitation workers. The idea is simple – to transform discarded trash into quirky fashion garments. And it worked big time.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Among the sea of loud, over-the-top sneakers that inundate store shelves and closets, there is one brand that sings a different tune <strong>&amp;ndash; Common Projects</strong>. With its <strong>whispered luxury</strong> and <strong>less-is-more</strong> <strong>aesthetic</strong>, the brand co-founded in the mid Nineties by friends <strong>Peter Poopat</strong> and <strong>Flavio Girolami</strong> continues to be a bestseller for connoisseurs seeking a dose of minimal chic cool.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A top choice for countless self-confident celebs, editors and style influencers including Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Ellen DeGeneres, Nick Jonas, Alexander Skarsgard and Drake, these sneakers are as stripped down as it gets. Crafted in Italy from premium leather, the only form of detail is the gold stamped numbers. That&amp;rsquo;s because the brand&amp;rsquo;s mantra is to let the shoes speak for themselves.</p>

<p>When Girolami and Poopat launched the brand, they were set on deconstructing the sneaker to monastic effect eager to strike a balance between over-designed the barrage of colorful sneakers and boring formal shoes. Their first shoe, the Achilles, unveiled in 2004 was an instant hit with the fashion tribe. And success continues to characterize this unique brand.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Five years after the launch of the first <strong>NikeCraft Mars Yard</strong>, <strong>Nike and artist Tom Sachs</strong> are back <strong>on the scene</strong> with a new and improved reiteration of the 2012 original, a high-performing shoe inspired by Sachs&amp;rsquo; interactions with <strong>NASA&amp;rsquo;s</strong> highly specialized scientists. The latest <strong>2.0 version</strong> stems from Sachs&amp;rsquo; long-term, exacting and extensive testing of the original.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;It passed the abrasion test. It passed the strength test. It passed the folding test. It passed all the tests, but when we started wearing it, it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet our expectations,&amp;rdquo; explains Sachs.</p>

<p>Guided by Nike designers, Sachs&amp;nbsp;spent these five years testing the shoe, wearing it regularly and thoroughly day in day out. The result is the NikeCraft&amp;nbsp;Mars Yard 2.0 that fully reflects the design ethos shared by Sachs and Nike:&amp;nbsp;Working to advance human potential, we&amp;nbsp;believe&amp;nbsp;there is no finish line.</p>

<p>Hence, they both flexed their muscles to improve durability. The original Vectran on the upper has been replaced by a more breathable polyester warp-knit tricot mesh while the donning straps are now bonded with a stronger X box stitch. On the outsole, the tread of the SFB has been inverted to adapt to more urban contexts. Finally, the&amp;nbsp;Mars Yard 2.0 comes with two insoles, mesh and&amp;nbsp;cork &amp;ndash; ideal for sockless wear.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Okay, while her show-stopping bare-all-bombshell-tarty style (think her pasties look at the Fall 2017 Haider Ackermann show in Paris) is of the dubious brow-raising variety, when it comes to her music achievements,  Nicky Minaj’s talent  is undisputable. 

 The busty  Trinidadian-born American rapper, singer, and songwriter , in fact, has declared herself the most awarded female rapper ever and took to  Instagram  to broadcast a string of self-celebratory accomplishments.&nbsp; 

 “Attention!! I love God. According to Universal Records, this year alone, my album catalogue sold 325K worldwide and #ThePinkprint is now at 4 Million worldwide,” she wrote. “Since January, I’ve received 11 billboard entries, and yesterday with that ASCAP award, I became the most awarded female rapper in history. To top it all off, this year I received the title for most Hot 100 entries by any woman in the HISTORY of MUSIC. A title previously held by Aretha Franklin for 40 years. 

 “They don’t want you to post your achievements &amp; accomplishments. It makes them uncomfortable,” she added. “But you must! B/c every day, ppl broadcast your failures. They shout them to the mountain tops. So never EVER stop posting your accomplishments. I love my fans so much.” 

 Nicki is currently working on a new album, the fourth since she released The Pinkprint in 2014. 

 According to the Internet, Minaj also recently became the most viewed rapper in history, with a total of 12.2 billion combined views, beating&nbsp;Eminem who has&nbsp;1.9 billion. 

 On a more philanthropic note, the rapper is cashing out to pay off&nbsp;her fans’ student debts and&nbsp;bringing clean water to an impoverished Indian village. 

 Bravo Nicki!

 Directed by  Jon Nguyen , the upcoming documentary explores his earliest moments, revealing insight on the prolific filmmaker, from his early years in small town Montana, Idaho, to the harsher life on the streets of Philadelphia.&nbsp; 

 Through family photos and film footage,&nbsp;David Lynch&nbsp;recalls his background and the start of his career as an artist and painter, later moving into experimental film. Encircled by a cloud of cigarette smoke, he also details how he first met Toby Keeler, who introduced him to his father, the artist Bushnell Keeler, and how he was mesmerized by the latter’s art studio.&nbsp; 

 It also shows how Lynch earned a grant from the American Film Institute that allowed him to move to Los Angeles and work on his early masterpiece,&nbsp;Eraserhead.

				<meta property="og:title" content="LANVIN TAPS OLIVIER LAPIDUS">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p><strong>Olivier Lapidus</strong> is the new <strong>Creative Director of Lanvin</strong>, replacing <strong>Bouchra Jarrar</strong> who left the storied French house after 15 months and two collections. She was tapped as the successor to Alber Elbaz in March 2016.</p>

<p>According to WWD, little-known Lapidus is expected to show his first&amp;nbsp;collection in September for spring 2018. He arrives at a challenging moment for the Maison founded by <strong>Jeanne&amp;nbsp;Lanvin</strong>&amp;nbsp;in 1889 and now controlled by Taiwan-based media magnate Shaw-Lan Wang.</p>

<p>Lately, sales have declined steeply with the house posting its first loss last year in more than a decade.</p>

<p>Lapidus is the former chief of the Ted Lapidus label, founded by his father. He recently launched what he calls the world&amp;rsquo;s first web-based couture house. Through an online runway show, customers can book an appointment to be measured by a local team of seamstresses through a hotline available in 11 languages and follow the entire creation process via web. His appointment has certainly raised eyebrows, even among Lanvin&amp;rsquo;s board members.</p>

<p>According to the latest rumors, Jarrar departed due to the friction with Lanvin&amp;rsquo;s chief executive officer Mich&amp;egrave;le Huiban. For F/W 2017-18, Jarrar&amp;rsquo;s second season at Lanvin, the message was feminine, pragmatic, romantic and confident. Inspired by couture and the opera, the line-up was filled with fluid dresses countered by soft pants, tailored jackets and edgy biker jackets. Jarrar&amp;rsquo;s first advertising campaign fronted Stella Tennant in all her striking androgynous beauty shot by Italian photographer Paolo Roversi.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="GUCCI PRE-FALL 2017 ">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Call it the more-the-merrier. Maximalist extravaganza. Over-the-top. Whichever, the<strong> Gucci pre-fall 2017</strong> campaign brims with the flamboyance and vibrancy typical of <strong>Alessandro Michele</strong> and his mashup of colors, patterns, symbols and layers.</p>

<p>Titled &amp;ldquo;<strong>Soul Scene</strong>&amp;rdquo;, the new imagery was shot in London and celebrates diversity with people of color as the sole protagonists of the campaign, obviously clad in head-to-toe Gucci. Once again lensed by <strong>Glen Luchford</strong>, the images reference England&amp;rsquo;s underground Northern Soul movement of the Sixties with models and artists letting loose in front of the camera with a passionate and upbeat innuendo.</p>

<p>The original reference melds with the atmospheres evoked by the pictures of Malian artist <strong>Malick Sidib&amp;eacute;</strong>, who portrayed the scene of the young crowd, parties and families of Bamako, Mali&amp;rsquo;s capital, in the Sixties and the Seventies.</p>

<p>The pre-fall collection adds another chapter to Michele&amp;rsquo;s success story, this time via flying carpets, dragons, panthers and the planet Saturn. His engaging line-up features opulent evening dresses that nod at Marie Antoinette countered by tracksuit-esque leggings and sweatshirts infused with a vintage feel. Patchwork shirtdresses ooze sophistication while his take on American preppy features a Boho touch. Michele certainly knows how to work his magic to enchanting effect.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s neon lights, dimly-lit streets, skyscrapers, subway and geisha sensuality serve as the backdrop for <strong>Saint Laurent&amp;rsquo;s latest video installation called #YSL10</strong> and filled with the label&amp;rsquo;s men&amp;rsquo;s <strong>Fall 2017</strong> garb.</p>

<p>Directed by <strong>Nathalie Canguilhem</strong>, it offers Anthony Vaccarello&amp;rsquo;s unique interpretation on his steamy and modern streetwear. <strong>Enigmatic, moody and somewhat eerie, </strong>the video stars a gaggle of models&amp;nbsp;including Dalibor Urosevic and Paul Manniez,&amp;nbsp;who fall under a mysterious spell and take a dreamy-meets-reality trip into the night, all accompanied by a narrator reading <strong>Oscar Wilde&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;Her Voice. </strong></p>

<p>Vaccarello is no stranger to controversial ad campaigns. His Spring Summer 2017 ads were removed from billboards across France under orders from the country&amp;rsquo;s Advertising Watchdog. Reportedly, the models in fishnet tights and high-heeled roller-skates, their legs wide open in explicit positions, triggered many complaints by insulted consumers who viewed the images as degrading and rape encouraging.</p>

 The  exquisitely-refurbished, five-floor building  in the 8th arrondissement, complete with parquet floors, stuccoed ceilings and marble fireplaces, is a multi-purpose space divided between private and public that is also poised to become the brand’s runway venue. It houses showrooms, VIP fitting rooms and Chloé’s rich archives spanning 60 years of history, alongside exhibition and events spaces, primarily dedicated to women and the Chloè girl, in the same independent, curious and elegant spirit of its founder Gaby Aghion and of its current Creative Director Natacha Ramsay-Levi. 

 The Maison’s first exhibition celebrates photographer Guy Bourdin, Aghion’s close friend who shot for the house since its establishment in 1952 and who continued to collaborate with various head designers, especially in the swinging Sixties when the brand was a favorite of Jackie Kennedy and Brigitte Bardot.

<p>Words that ring especially timely, true and focused in the wake of the tragic events that continuously make headlines.

<p>As the Versace house pointed out on Instagram, the campaign is &amp;ldquo;a powerful manifesto of unity and hope.&amp;quot;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" The  Victoria and Albert Museum  in London has opened its doors to  “Balenciaga: Shaping   Fashion ”, a major show dedicated to the Spanish designer, a man of great talent who shaped modern fashion.  Running through Feb. 18 , the retrospective takes an intimate look at Balenciaga’s work, offering insight on his  signature shapes ,  intricate process of constructing  and his  relationship with his clients . 

  A perfectionist   who shied from the limelight , Balenciaga hardly released interviews hence the lack of documentation on his thoughts, vision and work. Reflecting his nature, the exhibition is staged in a small and intimate space inside the museum. Marking a century since Balenciaga opened his first boutique in his native Spain, the show features over  100&nbsp;important pieces  by the designer, his protégés and modern designers, inspired by his legacy and artistry. They include Phoebe Philo, J.W. Anderson, Rick Owens and Calvin Klein. 

 Some of the highlights include Balenciaga’s fascination with the sleeve, especially the now-popular lantern shape, and drapes. For example, one dress dated 1967 is fashioned from a single fabric joined at the center in the back, with no side seams. X-ray artist Nick Veasey produced scans of the garments to show their inner constructions and lightness.&nbsp;

<p>The result is an <strong>explosive, limited-edition handmade tote</strong> crafted from eye-popping handwoven cotton, vivid Mayan embroidery, exotic florals and bone beads, all elevated by Louboutin&amp;rsquo;s wit and artistic flair.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;You only need to visit my house and see all the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve brought back over the years to know I really love the diversity of Mexican design,&amp;rdquo; says Louboutin. &amp;ldquo;The heritage is so rich, from the indigenous side, to the arrival of the Spanish, to the m&amp;eacute;lange when these two come together. I love the embroideries, the colors, the pagan motifs of wild animal, and all the images of death, taken in such a light way that it isn&amp;rsquo;t scary anymore.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>For this special undertaking, Louboutin has collaborated with the Taller Maya association, renowned for helping natives in the Yucatan Peninsula to preserve their unique crafting skills, heritage and artisanship. They are predominantly women who have inherited the expertise from their mothers, grandmothers and great grandmothers. Taller Maya offers safe and friendly workshops where the locals can work and gather, creating a sort of community that caters to the needs of motherhood and family life.</p>

<p>Every Mexicaba sold will benefit Taller Maya and Mexican artisans, supporting these natives in providing for themselves while preserving their cultural heritage.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;Even beyond the economic impact and positive social impact on more than 100 families, what everyone loves is the special energy. Working with Christian Louboutin&amp;rsquo;s team has opened our minds to new possibilities,&amp;rdquo; says Maria-Carola Diez, the director of Fundacion Haciendas del Mundo Maya/Taller Maya.</p>

<p>In the wake of last year&amp;rsquo;s project to help vulnerable young mothers in Senegal, every Mexicaba is adorned with a little &amp;ldquo;poupette&amp;rdquo; bag charm, made by the Senegalese women, dressed in Paris and accessorized in Italy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

And now the German sportswear giant is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a milestone treat &amp;ndash; <strong>a red and black limited-edition re-issue</strong> in honor of the legendary sportsman. Quintessentially Adidas and delightfully retro, it features the iconic Three Stripes running down the side of the jacket, pants and T-shirt.

To score top-league style points.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know?&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Franz Beckenbauer in Snippets</strong></p>

<p>Born on Sept. 11, 1945 in Munich, West Germany, Beckenbauer led West Germany to the World Cup title as a player in 1974 and as its manager in 1990. He is the only man to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager. His track-record is unique.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that <strong>Antonia</strong> continues to be one of the most sought-after partners for exclusive high-profile collaborations with top fashion players, both established and fledgling.</p>

<p>The latest tie-up is for men with <strong>hot Milan-based streetwear brand GCDS</strong> founded in 2015 by brothers Giuliano and Giordano Calza, creative director and CEO respectively.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The result is a variation on the <strong>label&amp;rsquo;s iconic logoed sweatshirt</strong> reimagined via an exclusive brick red shade and embroidered with <strong>Antonia</strong> in the front and <strong>Milano</strong> in the back. Another standout element are the blue and white bands on the left arm, a departure for the typical tonal coloring of the GCDS&amp;rsquo;s logo.</p>

<p>The capsule stems from the desire to show how the success story of a blooming young brand like GCDS, whose F/W 2017 sales jumped 300 percent against S/S 2017, starts in the heart of Milan, elevated by Made in Italy craftsmanship and by the desire to propel a young and fresh image of Italy, albeit one with a high-resonating global connection. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A favorite among influencers such as Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora, Joe Jonas, Bella Hadid, Sofia Richie&amp;nbsp; and Chiara Ferragni, GCDS has tapped singer and trendsetter Caroline Vreeland&amp;nbsp;to front its spring&amp;nbsp;advertising&amp;nbsp;campaign. Lensed by Jason Lee Parry, the images are steamy and bold, capturing Vreeland and model&amp;nbsp;Adonis Bosso, clad in multicolored, come-hither garb, as a couple spending their honeymoon in a Los Angeles hotel.</p>

<p>Plastered on <strong>limited-edition bags and small leathergoods</strong>, including the Keepall, the Neverfull and the Speedy, Leonardo da Vinci&amp;rsquo;s <strong>Mona Lisa</strong> is the star of this unique line-up developed by the French luxury brand and Koons. Unveiled at a high-wattage dinner at the Louvre museum, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Connelly, Miranda Kerr, L&amp;eacute;a Seydoux, Michelle Williams and Jennifer Aniston were among the top-class celebrities who swooned over each bag.</p>

<p>Koons, who enjoyed carte blanche on the project, also developed a new variant of LV&amp;rsquo;s signature monogram motif that he matched with the artists&amp;rsquo; names &amp;ndash; <strong>Da Vinci, Rubens, Titian, Van Gogh and Fragonard</strong> &amp;ndash; spelled out on the front in metallic block letters. Obtaining a detailed and high-definition reproduction of the paintings on canvas took more than a year.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;<em>What my &amp;ldquo;Gazing Ball&amp;rdquo; paintings are really about is the appreciation for things that came before us. Louis Vuitton is a major sponsor of the art and there was so much freedom on this project. There is also a reflective process about the person being interlinked with the bag. I would hope that when somebody walks down the street with one (of the bags) they are really celebrating humanity and that someone who the bag can emotionally feel this connectivity. I believe that these bags are art</em>,&amp;rdquo; says Jeff Koons of the project.</p>

Regardless of the shape or form, each one is a testament of Kawakubo&amp;rsquo;s influential legacy and avant-garde sensibility.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Steered by <strong>French billionaire Bernard Arnault</strong> and his family group, the <strong>LVMH Mo&amp;euml;t Hennessy</strong> <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> luxury empire wants to take control over <strong>Christian Dior with a $13.1 billion deal</strong> to buy out minority shareholders for the 25.7 percent stake it does not already own. The transaction would streamline and consolidate LVMH&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the Parisian fashion house. With the deal, LVMH, which already owns Parfums Christian Dior, would gain full ownership of the Christian Dior haute couture, leather, men&amp;rsquo;s and women&amp;rsquo;s ready-to-wear, and footwear division.</p>

<p>According to a quote published in The New York Times, Bernard Arnault stated that &amp;ldquo;The corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH&amp;rsquo;s fashion and leather goods division.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>The LVMH roster of luxury brands already includes Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Berluti, Givenchy and Loro Piana, among others. According to the press, Arnault&amp;rsquo;s decision to acquire full ownership of Dior was well received by analysts and investors. To finance the operation, Arnault will use the group&amp;rsquo;s remaining stake in rival Herm&amp;egrave;s International as partial payment.</p>

<p>For this new project, Adidas has joined forces with <strong>Silicon Valley-based Carbon</strong>, which created&amp;nbsp;Adidas&amp;nbsp;Futurecraft&amp;rsquo;s unique midsoles based on the analysis of 17 years of athlete-driven running data. Furthermore, this <strong>digital-enhanced footwear</strong> bypasses traditional prototyping or molding in the design process thanks to a mix of software, hardware and molecular science. Exclusive and futuristic, the process overcomes any limitations of the past, paving the way for a new era in design and manufacturing that further unleashes creativity while enhancing the technical side, durability and elastomeric responsiveness.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it brings innovative products to consumers faster than ever as it enables Adidas to go directly from design to production, skipping many of the middle phases.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>&amp;ldquo;Be Humble&amp;rdquo; riffs Kendrick Lamar in his latest video shot by director Dave Meyers, yet the special, eye-catching effects and technically-forward photography make it quite the opposite. The mix of evocative and high-impact visuals are Lamar&amp;rsquo;s burning head, disorienting camera motions, the Last Supper parody and the rapper cycling around a shrunken globe. In the beginning, he stands preacher-like in an empty room dressed as the pope and soaked in divine light and a few seconds later he is captured lounging on waddles of cash surrounded by semi-naked female accountants. According to various online reviews, the technology employed in&amp;nbsp; making the video spans from fish eye lenses to a special crane-controlled camera robot, specifically a Bolt made by Mark Roberts Motion Control that allows for extremely fast accelerating and precise movement, to a GoPro Omni&amp;nbsp;mounted on the handlebars of Kendrick&amp;#39;s bike, capturing a quirky 360-degree effect.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>In a city bubbling with activity, also stirred by the Salone del Mobile furniture and design fair, a crop of high-profile guests flocked to the <strong>Antonia boutique in Milan</strong> to fete the unveiling of the <strong>Dior SS 2017</strong> <strong>collection</strong>, the first designed by <strong>Maria Grazia Chiuri.</strong></p>

<p>Antonia is one of a handful of world-leading stores chosen by Dior for this project. The others are Colette in Paris, The Webster in Miami, The Corner in Berlin and Maxfield in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Customized for Antonia, the windows featured an exclusive luminous display with the writing <strong>&amp;ldquo;Dio(r)evolution</strong>,&amp;rdquo; one of Chiuri&amp;rsquo;s key messages for the season, splashed on T-shirts.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside, Chiuri&amp;rsquo;s most emblematic creations were displayed with focus, modernity and graphic appeal. Among trays of champagne and strawberries, Antonia&amp;rsquo;s most loyal clients and Dior fans went gaga over the gentle embroidered tulle skirts, gauzy knits, sturdy Tees and sharp tailoring, such as sleeveless coats, mixed in with the latest logoed accessories. As they swooned over each piece, they were immortalized by Maripol, a visionary artist/photographer, celebrated for her signature Polaroid imagery that captured the likes of Madonna, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, their zeitgeist and vibrant New York party life.</p>

<p>Her presence was an Antonia-only exclusive. Maripol autographed her signature vintage-effect saturated Polaroids, leaving them to the guests as a memoir of the evening.</p>

<p>Maripol first teamed up with Chiuri, her longtime friend and admirer, to capture the designer&amp;rsquo;s debut at Dior through exclusive Polaroids and videos shot in the backstage of the SS 2017 show</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;<em>For me, the Dior woman is a woman living in the moment. She is active and independent, with a real personality but never forgets that she is feminine. I interpreted this collection with what I know best: my faithful Polaroid</em>,&amp;rdquo; says Maripol.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Maria Grazia Chiuri adds, &amp;ldquo;<em>For me Maripol, an American from France, is synonymous with a world that has always fascinated me. She worked with incredible artists such as Fiorucci, Madonna, Blondie and Keith Haring. That&amp;rsquo;s why I asked her to take my first portrait for Dior and asked her capture the emotions of my first shows</em>.&amp;rdquo;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="INTRODUCING THE NIKELAB AIR MAX 97 X RICCARDO TISCI">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>To mark the 20th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of&amp;nbsp;<strong>Nike&amp;rsquo;s Air Max</strong> sneaker, <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong> has created his very own version of the celebrated kick.</p>

<p>Convinced that the next big trend in fashion is <strong>honesty</strong>, the Italian designer, who effortlessly mixes sportswear and couture, is looking inward &amp;mdash; reminiscing on all the things that sparked his imagination in the early years of his high-profile design career.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The future is about honesty. Everything people want seems to be honest, to be real,&amp;rdquo; Tisci explains. &amp;ldquo;People want honest clothes, honest shoes, honest everything. This is really what people look for, design-wise, color-wise and in fashion and in the way people dress.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>His Air Max 97 comes with a distinctive <strong>street vibe</strong>, in the shape of a <strong>mid-cut silhouette</strong> in black with white outsole, contrast stitching and embossed logo. &amp;ldquo;I gave it more height, because I think it&amp;rsquo;s much more &amp;lsquo;street;&amp;rsquo; it&amp;#39;s typical of me,&amp;rdquo; says Tisci, a self-proclaimed sneaker-head.</p>

<p>While Tisci candidly admits that he&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;getting older,&amp;rdquo; the interests of his youth still impact his design. That explains the more grown-up twist he&amp;rsquo;s given the Air Max 97, further exalting his celebrated &amp;ldquo;sportswear meets luxury&amp;rdquo; aesthetic. While maintaining the shoe&amp;rsquo;s soul in terms of shape, tooling and length, he didn&amp;rsquo;t shy away from weaving in elements of himself.</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The Air Max 97 had huge influence and impact on&amp;nbsp;Italian culture,&amp;rdquo; contends Tisci. &amp;ldquo;The Air Max 97 is an iconic, young shoe of the Nineties. At the time, I was involved with DJs and music, and in the clubs the people leading the big waves were wearing Air Max. That period has a lot of history.&amp;nbsp; It was the first meeting of sportswear and fashion.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>Tisci began&amp;nbsp;his relationship with Nike in 2014, his latest effort being the&amp;nbsp;NikeLab Dunk Lux Chukka x RT.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="  Chloé  has appointed  Natacha Ramsay-Levi  as  creative director  for ready-to-wear, leather goods and accessories. The former creative director of women’s ready-to-wear at Louis Vuitton, who succeeds  Clare Waight Keller , will unveil her first Chloé collection for  Spring 2018 , in Paris in September. 

 Ramsay-Levi perfectly mirrors the spirit of the storied house, founded in 1952 by Gaby Aghion with the intent to make clothes with “a happy spirit, to make people happy.” 

 The designer cut her teeth at Balenciaga, where she joined in 2002, and quickly scaled the rungs of success becoming Ghesquière’s right hand woman. After a few high-profile consulting stints, she rejoined Ghesquière at Vuitton. Ramsay-Levi’s  strong and confident personality,  matched to her expertise, enthusiasm and charisma, make her a great candidate to handle the highly-pressured and competitive fashion industry. 

 Each Chloè collection is a labor-intensive affair brought to life in the atelier where the longest standing “petite main” boasts a 30-year experience. Over 800 meters of silk are finely crafted for a runway show, awash with over 60 different colors, with three seamstresses working on a single dress. A bespoke red carpet gown, instead, is in the works for 200 hours. 

 A unique heritage that the house continues to preserve and update with a contemporary and cool flair. And now with a new creative point of view.

In his quest to prove that the suit is still alive even among the Insta-obsessed generations, and that it should simply be lightened up with a contemporary street vibe, Van Assche regrouped a number of models who dip into the gabber scene that in the mid Nineties sparked the Dutch and Belgian youth. Wearing the standout looks and accessories of the season, they move rapidly, sometimes frenetically, with highly-charged physicality to a wild and thrashing beat. The effect is bold, edgy, controlled and sharp, just like the collection.</p>

<p>Because as Van Assche puts it, &amp;ldquo;they should just let us rave.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>At the moment, there is no indication on a successor at the house, which <strong>is owned by of</strong>&amp;nbsp;<strong>LVMH Mo&amp;euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton. </strong></p>

<p>Among Tisci&amp;rsquo;s high-wattage customers are Kim Kardashian, Madonna, Beyonc&amp;eacute;, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Ciara and Kanye West.</p>

<p>According to WWD, some of Tisci&amp;rsquo;s potential successors are Hedi Slimane, Alber Elbaz, Peter Dundas, Clare Waight Keller, Rodolfo Paglialunga and Peter Copping, plus hot ticket Balmain&amp;rsquo;s Olivier Rousteing.</p>

<p>On his Instagram account, Tisci wrote &amp;ldquo;a giant heartfelt thank you to Givenchy, LVMH, my incredible team, the magical atelier and everyone who made these 93 collections possible and all the other crazy adventures. The love and support, in the day and night, will forever remain in my heart.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>After John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald, Tisci brought buzz, irreverence and heat to the storied label, also upping the desirability of its accessories. His creative whim was fueled by the streets, the club scene, sexual prowess, all ingredients that turned him into one of the most influential and inventive designers on the scene. Ultimately, Givenchy&amp;rsquo;s revenues increased more than sixfold during his tenure, reaching sales of 500 million euros, according to WWD.</p>

<p>Margiela started his career as an assistant to Jean Paul Gaultier in 1980 and retired from the fashion scene in 2009, seven years after Renzo Rosso and his Only the Brave group acquired a majority stake in the house. Since 2014, it is steered by John Galliano and is now called Maison Margiela.

On a major roll, the super model kicked off the new year in high gear with the gentle imagery that defines the aesthetic of the Roman luxurygoods house once again shot by  Karl Lagerfeld.   

 Hadid, who walked in the exclusive Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and was named the 2016&nbsp;Model of the Year, posted on Instagram her excitement on the gig writing &quot;What a dream come true to start off the new year!&quot; 

 Framed by wall-papered interiors, a fireplace and shelves filled with intricately embellished accessories, the campaign oozes a softer edge, breaking away from the previous one starring Kendall Jenner wrapped up in lively colors and bold patterns. 

 Recently, the in-demand Hadid also appeared in Dior&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moschino ads.

In rust or midnight blue, the revised <strong>Les 9-eye</strong> boots features an exaggerated tongue, a sports-driven removable strap and bright red or yellow laces while the <strong>Talib 8-eye</strong> boot, in blue or black, is characterized by a nabuk upper and striped leather lace keepers.</p>

<p>All four styles have an exclusive striped inner sock personalized with both logos.</p>

<p>At once luxurious, utilitarian and industrial, these new models will lure true aficionados of both brands, becoming a symbol of self-expression to stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>A trans-generational testament of irreverent style among musicians, youth cultures and tribes, the first pair of Dr. Martens boots made its foray in 1960. With its traditional yellow stitching, grooved sole and heel-loop, it was the perfect boot for workers thanks to its sturdiness, durability and overall lightness compared to its competitors at the time.&amp;nbsp;</p>

The well-constructed sporty-meets-utility lineup includes tracksuits and jogging pants, often in gauzy transparencies, countered by tailored blazers, shirts and shorts.</p>

<p>Established in 2010, Cottweiler has established a strong cult following becoming a highly influential lifestyle brand for young affluent men seeking forward-looking novelty in men&amp;rsquo;s dressing.&amp;nbsp;</p>

 Following his stunning spring show, Piccioli worked on the new ad imagery, the first that fully represents the designer’s vision for the storied house. Eager to make a statement more than just showing the clothes, he imagined two parts – spontaneous and fresh backstage shots taken during the spring runway show and powerful black-and-white portraits of seven models across different age brackets, personalities and ethnicities. They include Christy Turlington, Liya Kebede, Ratner, Fei Fei Sun, Lorena Maraschi, Blesnya Minher and Mali Koopman. The high-contrast images will be matched together. 

 Last year, Piccioli and his longtime creative partner&nbsp;Maria Grazia Chiuri&nbsp;ended their 20-plus year work relationship with him remaining at Valentino and Chiuri taking the creative reins at Dior.&nbsp;

Adidas also renewed its iconic NMD and Air Max silhouettes and sealed sponsorships with players such as&nbsp;NBA star James Harden&nbsp;and&nbsp;World Series champion Kris Bryant. 

 Moreover, it introduced the revolutionary  UltraBoost  technology which seamlessly blends performance and fashion edge. 

 “I think because we have both performance products and style products, it’s not easy, but it gives us the opportunity to chase the consumer where the consumer wants to be,” says Mark King, president of the company in North America. “UltraBoost is the greatest example of it. It was going to be the ultimate running shoe, which it is, and now it’s the ultimate fashion shoe. These products can play both, and that’s not easy to do, but that’s the opportunity.”

		<meta property="og:description" content="  Rosso Valentino  or  Valentino red . A color that is a longstanding symbol of one of the most storied couture and fashion houses, a passion that coined a specific reference. 

 &nbsp; 

  Red has guts… deep, strong, dramatic.  

  A geranium red.   A Goya red…for clothes, it is strong, like black or white.  

 &nbsp; 

 Those are the words of the legendary  Valentino  used to describe his love for this intense color, reportedly inspired by the opera in Barcelona when as a teenager, he marvelled at the way women seated in the&nbsp;opera house balconies resembled baskets of red flowers. 

 The list of Valentino’s star-studded clients in red is long, spanning from European royalty to American socialites to golden screen celebrities - Jackie Onassis, Elizabeth Taylor, Halle Berry, Jennifer Garner, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Naomi Watts, Claire Danes, Gwen Stefani, Lindsay Lohan, and Gwenyth Paltrow, among others. 

 For the upcoming spring season,  Pierpaolo Piccioli , Valentino’s creative director, explores and reinvents red via macramé, taffeta, ruffles, poplin, fringed hems and the iconic Rock studs.&nbsp;As always, grand, opulent, distinctive and quintessentially Valentino.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Since the first Visible Air design debuted in 1987, the <strong>Nike Air Max</strong> line has been a bestseller. Despite the worldwide success story, some installments resonate more strongly in specific regions &amp;mdash; developing deep cultural and emotional connections to that place. For example, the <strong>Air Max 97</strong> shines a little brighter than its successors or predecessors in a country famed for its art, culture and appetite for innovation.</p>

<p>After its 1997 introduction, the shoe became an unofficial part of Italy&amp;rsquo;s wardrobe when a countrywide craze for &amp;ldquo;<strong>La Silver</strong>&amp;rdquo; blossomed.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>That phenomenon grew from a variety of subcultures bubbling in big cities like Rome, Milan and Naples before spreading to the nation&amp;rsquo;s smaller towns and villages. From club culture to graffiti to the catwalk and beyond, desire for the Air Max 97 transcends age and gender.</p>

<p>While some booms burn out after a few seasons, the Air Max 97 hype maintained in Italy for close to a decade &amp;mdash; and still sizzles under the surface. Its ostentatious shine, sleek lines, gleaming vehicular-style ventilation and introduction of the Total Max unit&amp;rsquo;s full-window cushioning fostered a mass appeal that still endures.</p>

<p>With the 20th anniversary of the Air Max 97 looming &amp;mdash; and ahead of more Italy-exclusive celebrations to follow last month&amp;rsquo;s limited rerelease&amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; some of those who were there from the start share their memories and thoughts on the now iconic silhouette.</p>

For his first ad campaign, <strong>Balenciaga&amp;rsquo;s artistic director Demna Gvasalia</strong> kept it real, tapping photographer <strong>Mark Borthwick </strong>to shoot a <strong>reportage-style couture mood</strong> on the streets of Paris in a spontaneous everyday setting. To obtain the feel, a crop of models who&amp;nbsp;walked in Gvasalia&amp;rsquo;s debut show, took to the streets carrying out every day actions such as having a coffee, waiting for a bus, &amp;nbsp;rushing down the streets, or reflected in the rear mirror of a truck. Besides a number of colorfully striped nylon bags, the clothes included a wide range of looks, from plaid pea coats to puffers to folkish layers worn over teetering heels, both chunky and skinny. A mix of energy and style at its best.</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="TOP FASHION RETAIL SPOTS ON THE DOWNSWING">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" While  Upper 5th Avenue  remains the world’s most expensive retail street in terms of rent, with Causeway Bay in Hong Kong nipping at its heel and Paris’ Avenue des Champs Élysées third, according to  Main Streets Across the World , a report by  Cushman &amp; Wakefield,  overall rental value for shopping high streets dipped slightly this year. 

 Monitoring  462 of the top retail streets   worldwide , the real estate company values the decrease as a consequence of brands seeking to balance the demands of physical and online presences. 

 &nbsp; 

 Upper 5th Avenue saw its first decrease in annual rents per square foot since the financial crisis with prices dropping from $3500 in 2015 to $3,000 per square foot this year. Vacancy rates, meanwhile,&nbsp;jumped to 15.9 percent&nbsp;from 10 percent a year earlier. 

 Yet together with Causeway Bay, they are both more than twice as expensive as the leading street in any other country, says the report.&nbsp; 

 Fashion district flagships, once considered a traffic and advertising need, are losing their importance to retailers. This is because often sales at these prime locations&nbsp;haven't kept up with rent, and retailers are under extreme pressure to cut their operating expenses, according to  Cushman &amp; Wakefield retail research VP Garrick Brown.  

 Conversely, there are a number of streets on the uptick with rents climbing significantly. Besides  London’s New Bond Street and Japan’s Ginza districts,   Milan’s Via Montenapoleone  logged in a 20 percent growth over the year to June, cementing its third position in the EMEA market thanks to its appeal for both mass market and luxury retailers. The French capital, instead, is home to five of the top most expensive high streets within the EMEA region.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
 Justin Taylor , Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s, Head of Retail, EMEA, said: “Retailers are facing technological advances head on, with more and more brands opting to offer online sales alongside, not instead of, a physical presence. Demand is strong for the right space in the right location and the lack of supply along the majority of Europe’s main thoroughfares is seeing rents rise further and expanding the boundaries of well-established streets.” 

  
According to  Gene Spiegelman , Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Vice Chairman, Head of Retail Services, North America, said: “Throughout 2016 the Americas region has benefited from stable consumer spending that has been sustained by steady employment and lower energy prices. This is an enduring trend from 2015 that we forecast to continue into 2017.&nbsp;The larger question, for 2017 and beyond, will be the unrelenting rebalancing of sales origination – bricks and mortar versus e-commerce.”&nbsp;

Other runner-ups for the coveted honor included Alexander Wang, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen for The Row, Irene Neuwirth and the Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez duo of Proenza Schouler. 

 In the six years since she launched her namesake line, Simmons has gathered a  loyal following  including Cara Delevingne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Karen Elson and Alexa Chung. With her hot designs, trigged by instinct over trend mania, she quickly became an industry favorite. 

 For fall, the designer channeled her signature Victorian and Edwardian flourishes, this time infused with an  artsy twist  and a  dragonfly print  inspired by the work of art nouveau glass artist Émile Gallé.&nbsp;Top choices are mid-to-teetering heel heights in a number of styles, from mules to gamine ankle-strap pumps, all delicately adorned with scallops, crystal piping, micro studs, tassels and a dense floral print. Perfect under skinny jeans or full skirts for a sexy, on-trend look.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Super sexy actor, singer-songwriter and director  Jared Leto  will play  Andy Warhol  in a new  biopic called Warhol  on the famous and controversial pop art artist.&nbsp; 

 The  Oscar-winning  American actor and front man for the band  30 Seconds to Mars , Leto is also the producer of the film while the screenplay is written by Terrence Winter (The Wolf of Wall Street and Get Rich or Die Tryin’) based on the book Warhol: The Biography written by Victor Bockris in 1989 of which Leto acquired the rights. 

 The movie explores Warhol’s trailblazing, subversive, frail, openly gay and eccentric personality, a man who shot to fame in the 1960s with his unique take on American lifestyle and its consumerism represented by soup cans, Coca Cola bottles and Marilyn Monroe. Warhol was also a key presence on the New York club scene.&nbsp; 

 Part rockstar, part A-list movie star, Leto is a man with an uncommon multi-pronged talent and versatility. Most recently, he plays the role of the murderous Joker in&nbsp; blockbuster&nbsp;film  Suicide Squad;  fronts the new 2016 imagery of Italian&nbsp;eyewear&nbsp;brand&nbsp; Carrera  as part of its 60th&nbsp;anniversary celebrations; is the face of the new scent  Hugo Just Different  by Hugo Boss; reveals his steamy sex appeal in Gucci’s master brand&nbsp; Gucci Guilty  &nbsp;fragrance  ads with models Julia Hafstrom and Vera Van Erp, shot by Glen Luchford in a baroque Venetian palazzo.&nbsp; 

 Thirty Seconds to Mars will also release its fifth studio album next year.&nbsp;

<p>Tapping into the momentum of the limited-edition NMD launched in July, Hu features a wide range of colorful footwear and dynamic activewear that ultimately celebrate equality, acceptance, co-existence and understanding via flags, stripes and translations of the phrase &amp;ldquo;Human Race&amp;rdquo; in English, French, and Japanese.

With  71 runway shows, 95 presentations and 31 events,  it’s sure to be round-the-clock adrenalin. Reportedly, the September shows generate revenues of 48 million euros . Italy’s Prime Minister&nbsp;Matteo Renzi &nbsp;will once again kick off the week while  Milan’s new mayor Giuseppe Sala  is set on making Milan even more international by increasing and highlighting the multitude of great events the city is able to host. 

 For five days, Milan’s cobble-stoned streets will swarm with stylish fashionistas, setting off a wave of flash bulbs and Snapchat-driven social media craze. 

 Amidst fashion’s revolution of  see-now-buy-now  and and  coed shows , there are a crop of can’t-wait-to-see shows starting with Alessandro Michele’s new message for Gucci. In just over a year, Michele has rocked fashion to outstanding results, his provocative-cum-over-the-top-cum-uber-cool vision creating ripples from Milan to Miami. 

 Fausto Puglisi, instead, will skip the runway this September in favor of captivating tableaux, similarly to his debut event in 2011. The setting is a cross between a theater piece and a fashion presentation, inspired by Sicily, his home region. 

 Ferragamo will unveil its first collection designed by its in-house team following the departure of designer Massimiliano Giornetti last March, who for 16 years steered the house’s creative helm. 

 To celebrate the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of Bottega Veneta and the 15th year of Tomas Maier as creative director, the company has opted to go coed by sh owing its men’s and women’s collections together. For the occasion, Maier has singled-out a special location on Via Brera to accommodate a larger crowd. 

 Accessories designer&nbsp;Sara Battaglia, instead, will unveil &nbsp;her first ready-to-wear collection on Sept. 25 alongside her spring bag range with an installation at Palazzo Bovara on Corso Venezia.

		<meta property="og:description" content="  GucciGhost , aka as Trouble Andrew, aka as Trevor Andrew, is a  NYC-based graffiti artist  who caught the eye of  Gucci’s red-hot creative director Alessandro Michele  for spray painting walls with his personal take on the house’s  GG logo . Michele was fascinated by the way the artist used the brand’s moniker so rather than taking offence, he challenged him to a collaboration. Through the language of street art and graffiti, GucciGhost’s spark trickled from the wall to the runway, resulting in bold accessories and unique pieces that include a tote with the word  “Real”  on black leather, spray-painted fur-trimmed bombers, pleated satin skirts and sneakers, plus a crop of crazy small leathergoods. It all made for the perfect medley of rakish smart and street style, luxed-up to the max that further enhances Michele’s influential vision and gender-ambiguous proliferation. Certainly, the vision of these two creatives propelled the power of the logo to new artsy magnitude.&nbsp;

Directed by  Steven Klein , the reel was shot in New York City and stars West, his wife,&nbsp;Kim Kardashian West, and a gaggle of models that are a favorite of Balmain’s creative director  Olivier Rousteing  - Joan Smalls,&nbsp;Jourdan Dunn,&nbsp;Alessandra Ambrosio, Jon Kortajarena, Ysaunny Brito, Josephine Skriver and Chico Lachowski, among others. Rousteing’s love for the album, in particular for the Wolves track featuring Sia, Vic Mensa, and Frank Ocean, triggered the idea to create a campaign around the music and lyrics. Fashionwise, the video blends the glossy and glitzy world of Balmain with West’s grungy aesthetic epitomized by the rapper’s beaded jacket over a white T-shirt and Fear of God jeans. The overall result further cements Rousteing’s creed that the music industry is a major and modern source of inspiration that talks to vast number of generations about life in general.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Heir to a long line of cognac-makers who were pioneers in luxury, <strong>Kilian Hennessy</strong> decided to challenge himself while keeping in with the family tradition of luxe brands. So in 2007, he launched his namesake project with the ambition of reflecting his distinct personality as well as achieving the perfect balance between elegance and uncompromising luxury. His &amp;quot;eco-luxe&amp;quot; philosophy makes each bottle refillable and kept for a lifetime. During his childhood haunts in the family cellars in Cognac, Hennessy learned about the &amp;quot;angels&amp;rsquo; share,&amp;quot; or what the House of Hennessy calls the percentage that inexplicably evaporates from cognac cellars, like an offering to the gods. Many of Hennessy&amp;#39;s fragrances carry this memory as they are reminiscent of the sugar in the alcohol and the wood of the cognac barrels. Hennessy cut his teeth training with the best noses in perfumery and working for the fragrance divisions of Christian Dior, Paco Rabanne, Alexander McQueen and Giorgio Armani.</p>

<p><em>&amp;ldquo;Perfume is an art for me, a messenger that opens a thousand doors in the memory.&amp;rdquo; Kilian Hennessy. &amp;ldquo;I want to put perfumery back on its pedestal by going back to the truth about perfume; back to the way perfume was made in the late 19th and the early 20th century, but adding a contemporary twist at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;</em></p>

<p>His select scents are the declination of five fragrance collections - L&amp;#39;Oeuvre Noire, Arabian Nights, Asian Tales, ln the Garden of Good &amp;amp; Evil and Addictive State of Mind. Each whiff embodies ultimate sophistication and timeless luxury.</p>

Besides influencing Kanye West&amp;rsquo;s stream of Yeezy projects, in 2014, he launched the buzzy Milan-based fashion label&amp;nbsp;Off-White which earned the <strong>prestigious LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers</strong> and which in only a few seasons has sky- rocketed to success, earnestly validated by the fashion system. Phone constantly in hand, Abloh is a great networker, always available to his fan, plugged into Instagram, chatting with friends or hanging out. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>IN OUR VIEW</strong> - Abloh is unquestionably ahead of the times with his streetwear infused mix which is quickly changing the fashion scenario via a desire to create a &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; around the brand, or the unique idea of interpreting fashion through DJs, musicians, rappers and artists. It&amp;rsquo;s a new fashion language for the new generations. Plus, Off-White&amp;rsquo;s social media outlets are super cool and engaging as are the people who work for him.</p>

Reinventions served up in multiple variations on the theme &amp;ndash; from ornate, as in splashed with floral patterns or delicately embellished with fluttering butterflies, to simple solid versions to leather and felt combos. A subcultural symbol worn by skinheads, punks and rockers, the bomber brims with a utilitarian chic allure becoming a <strong>must-have fall silhouette</strong>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" After months of speculation, the house of  Christian Dior  has confirmed the appointment of  Maria Grazia Chiuri  as  Creative Director . In her new plum job, Chiuri is the first women to steer the creative reins of the fabled French couture house. The decision marks the end of Chiuri’s 17-long year tenure at Valentino, eight of which spent together with co-creative director  Pier Paolo Piccioli . Together they catapulted the Roman house to the highest fashion echelon’s hitting the  one-billion dollar mark  and coining a new and exclusive concept of beauty, buzz, sensuality, modernity and craftsmanship. 

 Piccioli, instead, was named sole creative director of  Valentino . Chiuri will oversee the women’s haute couture, ready-to-wear and accessory collections, bringing a woman’s perspective to the house codes defined by Christian Dior. She will show her first rtw collection in Paris on Sept. 30. According to an in-depth article on WWD, Chiuri was chosen for her hands-on and pragmatic approach and for her global understanding of the values of the label. According to the authoritative paper, Dior closed 2015 with revenues of 1.87 billion euros, a 17.1 percent hike against last year. 

 &nbsp; 

 Offering her own take on the event,  Antonia  believes that “ Maria Grazia was ready for a change. She and Piero Paolo have been formidable partners who from the beginning believed in their new tenure with a dynamic and fresh perspective. I am sure he will succeed on his own and will be able to fully express himself also via the simplicity he has maintained throughout the years. He’s just more mature. Many years ago they came into my boutique to check their product which I had displayed differently and they were ecstatic. It won’t be easy for Maria Grazia at Dior but she’s a tough one and will thrive on this new challenge.”&nbsp;

In other words, the perfect investment piece. One rigorously made in the U.S according to labor-intensive practices with plush Italian fabrics. In that light, the sisters have filled their lack of designer background with relentless research in terms of materials, manufacturing techniques and volumes.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" According to an insightful article on  WWD,  the attack to Charlie Hebdo, young girls working in a textile factory in slave-like conditions and minors forced to sell drugs are interconnected illicit activities whose money used to feed them comes mainly from  counterfeiting.  According to the story, “Counterfeiting is the way terrorists and criminals finance themselves,” said  Michael Ellis , Interpol assistant director at the sub-directorate of Trafficking in Illicit Goods and Counterfeiting.&nbsp; Ellis spoke at a summit in Milan alongside speakers from the U.S., Europe and China who discussed the problem of counterfeiting and international regulatory compliance, sustainability and responsible sourcing. The meeting was aimed at involving the  Italian fashion system  in order to stir companies to crack down on counterfeiting and security in general. Considered the 21st-century crime, fake goods are one of the biggest concerns for fashion companies. While it is difficult to quantify losses, according to WWD, a country such as Italy loses more than  $6.7 billion in sales  every year, of which $5 billion in clothing and footwear. As a result, more than 60,000 people lose their jobs. Italian, American and French brands are the most affected. And worse still, the counterfeiting is connected to organized crime. The Internet has becomes a huge distribution channel for counterfeit products, especially in China, as is evident by the controversy around Chinese web giant Alibaba’s selling fakes on its platforms. So the bottom line is steer clear of fakes and spread the word on such a delicate and controversial issue.

It will also house 20,000 couture pieces and accessories tributing his career. Thousands of miles South, in Marrakech, near the famous <strong>Jardin Majorelle</strong> where the designer&amp;rsquo;s ashes were scattered, the second museum will open dedicated to his work.

				<meta property="og:title" content="POV: SIGN OF THE TIMES">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Rarely has the fashion system undergone such a <strong>seismic shift</strong> and radical change, one that requires tinkering with tried-and-true formulas that have defined the industry for decades. The consequences of adapting to this <strong>digitally-obsessed</strong> and <strong>highly-competitive</strong> era are designers increasingly pressured to churn out collections, <strong>seasons</strong> that have lost their relevance, the <strong>see-now-buy-now</strong> offering gaining momentum and more and more designers opting for <strong>co-ed</strong> shows. In this light, we believe that the fashion industry needs to rethink a few key points to continue thriving and stirring that unique can&amp;rsquo;t-live-without sensation linked to the pure indulgence of buying a great new IT bag, hot dress or die-for heels.</p>

<p>Both multi and mono brand stores should respect the official kick off of sales season instead of privately wooing customers for pre-sales via mailing lists and special invites ahead of time. Besides being unfair and damaging the market, it dampens the thrill of looking for that great seasonal bargain with day-one sprint to find the perfect bargain. We long for the bee-lines outside the stores&amp;hellip;</p>

<p>Stores should avoid in-season sales mixed in with full-price pre-collections that have just arrived in store because they create confusion in the customer&amp;rsquo;s mind. And the web shouldn&amp;rsquo;t serve as a tool with which to drive presales as it&amp;rsquo;s less controllable. This approach ultimately backfires on the customer and ruins the market for everyone.</p>

<p>Fashion shows require big investments for fashion houses and lots of time for retailers attending them. And, for the most part, they are boring. So co-ed shows are a great solution as they unify costs and raise visibility, offering a single vision for men and women. One world as seen and interpreted by the designer.</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN'S AFRICABA BAG - CHARITABLE STYLE">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>In a quest to mix new creative avenues with a good deed, <strong>Christian Louboutin</strong> has teamed up with his longtime friend <strong>Valerie Schlumberger</strong>, whose charity project <strong>La Maison Rose</strong> assists and supports the most vulnerable women and children in Senegal. The result is the stunning handmade <strong>Africaba</strong> tote, a colorful and exclusive expression of <strong>Western African</strong> inventiveness, tribal artisanship and artsy handiwork blended with the wit and artistic flair of Louboutin. &amp;ldquo;In Africa, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to make beautiful things simply from what is around you, it is necessity which drives creativity,&amp;rdquo; muses Christian Louboutin.</p>

<p>The bag&amp;rsquo;s colorful beaded panels, worked in <strong>patchwork</strong> form, and straps are counterpointed by Louboutin&amp;rsquo;s iconic spiked details, which also adorn the <strong>Grigri</strong> bag charm, or a miniature doll wearing traditional dresses from the region, enriched with a distinctive leather-and-spikes Louboutin touch.</p>

<p>The proceeds from sales of the bag will support the foundation. &amp;ldquo;Developing this project was very different from the normal Christian Louboutin process where we have a sample made and then replicate it perfectly,&amp;rdquo; says <strong>Louboutin</strong>. &amp;ldquo;Here instead we had an idea but we made it very clear that it had to be the artisan&amp;rsquo;s interpretation to create the final design. It is not about perfection. The charm is in the idiosyncrasies and slight differences which emerge when you are working with people who make things by hand.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>The two longstanding friends also shared insight in their relationship, the project and vision:</p>

<p><strong>Christian on Valerie</strong></p>

<p><em>What particularly interested you in Valerie&amp;rsquo;s work? </em></p>

<p>The selling of the products to raise money for charity is fantastic but with Valerie it was also a way to give a bigger contribution by giving wider exposure to Africa and their tradition of artisanal craftsmanship. Her interest is very much with the fate of these artists, appreciating and nurturing their unique talent.</p>

<p><em>What do you think of the work produced by the artists and artisans? </em></p>

<p>I have admired the color and graphic expression in African art and crafts for a long time. Artisanship and art are quite linked in Africa, the artist is surrounded by discarded things and with a child-like instinct, they see how you could use it to create something new, a natural sense of ecology, of reuse and repurpose.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Valerie on Christian:</strong></p>

<p><em>When did you first meet Christian?</em></p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;I met him over 30 years ago and it was a real thunderbolt. Christian attracted me both for his intelligence, boundless creativity and exceptional sympathy.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p><em>What would you like to achieve for La Maison Rose through this project?</em></p>

<p>Firstly a beautiful bag - each panel is different, every detail stunning, each bag unique. However this collaboration will also allow us to strengthen our professional training structure as we will open a much larger workshop, which will train more women, ensuring them a trade and employment. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><em>What is the purpose of La Maison Rose?</em></p>

<p>It helps young women and girls in severe difficulty, often with small children or pregnant. La Maison Rose offers them a welcoming home, listening and care.&amp;nbsp;</p>

The Giuseppe Verdi masterpiece was directed for the first time by <strong>Sofia Coppola, </strong>who offered a fresh, modern and simple take on an opera that even before its debut had raked in $1.3 million in ticket sales.</p>

<p>Valentino designed four gowns for <strong>Violetta</strong>, the protagonist, who stole the stage with dramatic swooshes of red, gold and black. Current Valentino creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, instead, designed the costumes for Flora Bervoix, Violetta&amp;rsquo;s friend, and for the chorus of over 1000 voices. All the costumes were created by Valentino&amp;rsquo;s Haute Couture Atelier and by the theater&amp;rsquo;s workshop, perfectly reflecting the Victorian period in which the tragic opera is set. According to the Theater&amp;rsquo;s original operaroma website, Valentino sees this special project &amp;ldquo;<strong><em>as a dream come true, since he has always been fascinated by opera and its power to invent fantastic and modern worlds, through wonderful and timeless music.&amp;rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>As for the guests, it was long list of heavy hitters, many of which flew in from Cannes to soak up the event. They included Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Keira Knightly, Monica Bellucci, Francis Ford Coppola, Diane von Furstenberg, Frida Giannini and Patrizio Di Marco, Luke Evans, Raoul Bova, Eugenia Niarchos and Princes Paolo and Marie Chantal of Greece.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>According to a crop of <strong>high-profile reports</strong> carried out by <strong>global analysts</strong> and <strong>research firms</strong>, the <strong>men&amp;rsquo;s wear sector</strong> is booming, growing <strong>1.5 times</strong> faster than its women&amp;rsquo;s counterpart. In 2014, according to Mintel, the men&amp;rsquo;s industry advanced 4.5 percent compared to 3.7 percent of women&amp;rsquo;s wear. By <strong>2019</strong>, men&amp;rsquo;s wear is poised to reach the <strong>$40</strong> <strong>billion</strong> mark in worldwide sales. Luxury companies are certainly riding the wave of success with invigorating and specific attentions on emerging countries such as Africa, namely Lagos and Nigeria, as well as leveraging on the spending habits of international travelers. Moreover, high-end men&amp;rsquo;s wear companies are determined to avoid brand confusion by choosing a more focused and coherent strategy in terms of product, tighter price ranges and luxe positioning. Obviously the consumer relationship is defined by social media outlets and e-commerce driven by experiential events to encourage store visits, focus on mobile technology and devices for tourists shopping abroad.&amp;nbsp; That said, men still prefer to be targeted in non-fashion contexts such as with news, lifestyle and professional areas. Furthermore, compared to women, they tend to invest on more <strong>traditional</strong> quality pieces with a longer life span although the <strong>ath-leisure wear</strong> and <strong>performance</strong> compartments are going strong among those men seeking function over form.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" As much as Hollywood, long-tressed surfers and striking sunsets are to  California  what the Colosseum is to Rome or the Big Ben to London, this warm and exotic part of the U.S also conjures images of a  relaxed and cool lifestyle  echoed by a precise fashion style.&nbsp; 

 Laid back? Sure. Cool? You bet. Sexy? Totally. 

 A sort of  crumpled who-cares West Coast street attitude  that is obviously studied down to the last detail and that a crop of Californian brands&nbsp; has exported across the world with huge success. &nbsp; 

 Take  Enfants Riches Déprimés , for example, which certainly evokes a dose of rebellion and provocation. Founded by Henri Alexander, it offers a punk-cum-underground vibe found in one-of-a-kind pieces that are a top choice among the likes of Jared Leto, Miley Cyrus, Ellen Goulding, Rita Ora and Frances Bean Cobain. Alexander, who grew up between Europe and the West Coast, has indeed forged a unique aesthetic. 

 Ditto for  Sandrine Rose , a line of casual, embellished and made-in-Los-Angeles denim and T-shirts by French designer Sandrine Abessera. Part vintage, part L.A lifestyle, it features a muted dusty palette with geometric patterns decorating skinny jeans. 

 A key image maker of Kanye West and Lady Gaga,  Matthew Williams’  Californian upbringing pulsates through  Alyx,  the young streetwear brand named after his daughter. Grounded in a refined aesthetic of skate-meets-streetwear culture, the wide-range collections made with plush Italian fabrics, channel a variety of global urban subcultures expressed via much black and white, hoods, tulle, shrunken silhouettes and sequins, mixed-and-matched easily. 

  RtA or Road to Awe  is designed by three LA fashion insiders and sells like crazy thanks to a crystal-clear vision. This girl is chic, confident and elegant yet sexy and effortless. So what does she wear? Amazing denim and leather, of course.&nbsp;

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p><strong>Rihanna</strong> knows how to handle her business! So reads one of the titles on <strong>rihannadaily.com</strong>, the pop star&amp;rsquo;s official website dedicated to RiRi&amp;rsquo;s multiple activities and events. Indeed, the steamy and ever-progressing songstress knows how to keep her foot in many shoes, including her <strong>Puma</strong> sneakers, for which she is Creative Director since December 2014. Since she joined the German sportswear giant, she has turned out a number of hot hitters, including a futuristic sneaker, a creeper, sexy ath-leisure garb and a fur-lined slide, inspired by her relentless globe-trotting pace. Her commitment is empowering, passionate and totally hands-on - she thrives on the notion of women succeeding in areas primarily dominated by men. And the fruits of the collaboration were quick to come with Puma&amp;rsquo;s net earnings up 4 percent in the first quarter of 2016.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, last year&amp;nbsp;the 28-year old Barbados-born star also became the first black face of <strong>Dior</strong>. Rihanna&amp;rsquo;s first-ever collection with <strong>Manolo Blahnik</strong> just hit stores with a sultry, denim-centric focus. &amp;ldquo;I have always loved Manolo Blahniks. Mr. Manolo&amp;rsquo;s shoes are the most luxurious and timeless shoe there is! His designs make women feel incredible when they wear them, so to be able to collaborate with him and combine our sensibilities has been a dream come true!&amp;rdquo; she muses.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Rihanna is certainly one of the most powerful celebrity endorsements of the moment. Further proof is the fact that the singer has signed a deal with <strong>LVMH</strong> to do a full makeup line called <strong>Fenty Beauty</strong>, slated to debut in September 2017. According to press reports, the deal is estimated at around $10 million.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Rihanna also controls a host of companies she founded including <strong>Roraj Trade</strong>, the&amp;nbsp; mother-company for all Rihanna&amp;rsquo;s business which owns trademark to &amp;ldquo;Rihanna&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rebelle By Rihanna&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Rebl&amp;rsquo;l Fleur&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;$chool Kills&amp;rdquo;; <strong>Rihanna Entertaiment</strong> that merges all of her businesses, including music, film, fragrance, fashion, and book ventures; <strong>Fenty Corp</strong> that hires multiple staff including consultants, project managers, assistants etc<strong>.</strong>;<strong> Westbury Road Entertaiment</strong>, Rihanna&amp;rsquo;s own record label with the first song published being Four Five Seconds featuring Kanye West and Sir Paul McCartney.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Insiders and not know that the <strong>Met Gala</strong> is THE party of the year in New York, the &amp;ldquo;Oscars of the East Coast&amp;rdquo; as it is referred to because of the celebrity status,&amp;nbsp; haute fashion wattage and hype that surrounds the event, for good or for bad.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Short for the&amp;nbsp;<strong>Metropolitan Museum of Art</strong>&amp;nbsp;<strong>Costume Institute</strong>&amp;nbsp;benefit, the ball is usually held the first Monday in May and is a fund-raising kicker for the Costume Institute. So as always, streams of <strong>Hollywood</strong> heavy-hitters flocked to mark the grand opening of the Costume Institute&amp;#39;s annual fashion exhibit, which each year celebrates a theme. This time it was <strong>&amp;ldquo;Manus x Machina: Fashion In An Age of Technology</strong>,&amp;rdquo; or the bond and balance between man and machine in creating fashion wizardry.&amp;nbsp; As usual, not all party-goers struck the right chord, some overdoing it, others missing the point while many got it right. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Regardless, here are some of the designers who scored the most thumbs up among attendees:&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Balmain</strong> whose metallic futuristic edge was donned by Cindy Crawford, Jourdan Dunn, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn and Alessandra Ambrosio. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> with Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Jennifer Connelly, Alicia Vikander, Alexander Skarsgard and Jaden Smith. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chanel</strong> with Kristen Stewart, Willow Smith, Louise Parker and Lily-Rose Depp. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Donatella Versace</strong> who dressed Zayne Malik, Lady Gaga, Kendall Jenner and Kate Hudson.</p>

<p><strong>Prada</strong> picked by Katy Perry, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone.</p>

<p><strong>Valentino&amp;rsquo;s</strong> frothy tulle on Lorde and Lily Collins.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>H&amp;amp;M</strong> for Ciara, Hailee Steinfeld, Jennifer Hudson and Amber Valletta.</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="MARK CROSS SS 2016">
		<meta property="og:description" content=" A refined yet contrasting mix of rose, azure, rattan, leopard spots and nectarine shades inject character into the  Mark Cross SS 2016  collection, which true to its name continues to thrive as an emblem of  whispered luxury . It’s the richness of the hues and textures, in fact, that defines and enhances the less-is-more aesthetic of each bag, true icons of haute craftsmanship, meticulously detailed, down to the last stitch of the exquisitely lined interiors. &nbsp;A name, a story soaked in time and tradition yet utterly contemporary. Founded in  1845  in Boston, Mark. W. Cross &amp; Co. was a purveyor of carriage saddles and harnesses that became known as Mark Cross when  Patrick Murphy  acquired the company in 1875 for $6,000. He paved the way for international expansion, relocating to New York and opening a shop on Broadway. His son  Gerald  Murphy joined the company and married trend-setting heiress Sara Wiborg. Together they set up home in Paris, befriending and entertaining characters of the Lost Generation:  Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter  (a&nbsp;friend from Murphy’s Yale&nbsp;days) and the  Fitzgeralds . They all fell under the couple's charm. After different ownerships, the company closed its doors in the 1990s until it was resurrected in 2011. Today it produces pieces in the same factories in Italy as the celebrated originals, which have been reimagined with a fresh eye. The collections are inspired by the archives of decades ago – the  Grace Box  bag, for example, was originally created by Gerald Murphy for Grace Kelly's role in&nbsp;Rear Window. Seasonally updated, Mark Cross’ bags are a reassuring buoy of good-taste in today’s ocean of luxury offerings.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" For the second time,  Marcelo Burlon  has partnered with  G-Shock  for a new limited-edition watch, the  GA-100 , to be launched globally. The bond between the avant-garde fashion guru and one of Casio’s best-known watches is as stronger as ever, spurred by a mutual passion to innovate and experiment. This time the protagonist is a signature Marcelo pattern - the snake – that trades its traditional colors in favor of a black and white 3D skin and scales. The serpent slithers over the watch seamlessly, from case to strap. Carefully detailed, the new GA-100 watch features an exotic twist with a dynamic streetwear spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

  &quot;It's a pleasure to collaborate with a brand like G-SHOCK. We share a constant creative research that celebrates the contemporary reality, while going beyond traditional canons to push further. We are especially pleased to present it today in Milan headquarters of County of Milan&quot;,  declares Marcelo Burlon - Creative Director of County of Milan. 

 Casio Italia President Yusuke Suzuki underscores how “ Our partnership with Marcelo Burlon underlines our watches’ unique style. We’re happy to work once again with an artist who expresses our innovative spirit by reinterpreting our shared philosophy and renewing our strong link with the dynamic world of fashion. ”

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>A crop of high-profile personalities flocked to the Antonia boutique on Thursday night for an intimate dinner hosted by <strong>Antonia Giacinti</strong> in honor of storied luxurygoods house<strong> Delvaux</strong> and its Artistic Director <strong>Christina Zeller</strong>. Framed by an elegant setting of ivy-shrouded candelabras, silverware, white candles and harp players, guests enjoyed a sit-down dinner and an exclusive <strong>F/W 2016-17</strong> preview. Steeped in the mantra that &amp;ldquo;simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,&amp;rdquo; the new Delvaux collection is at once precious and precise, reflecting the Maison&amp;rsquo;s enviable heritage with a touch of <strong>Art Deco</strong> folly. Alligator, lizard, python and galuchat are crafted with exceptional savoire-faire and with an innovative twist reflected in the colors, in bold degrad&amp;egrave; effects and in the lightness of each bag. A lively and refined repertoire soon in store so stay tuned.</p>

<p>An authentic <strong>Belgian</strong> brand since <strong>1829</strong>, Delvaux was founded a year before the birth of the Belgian nation, which declared its independence from the Netherlands in 1830. Under the stewardship of King L&amp;eacute;opold of Saxe-Cobourg Gotha, an uncle of the future Queen Victoria of England, Belgium enjoyed significant growth, becoming the world&amp;rsquo;s fourth-largest economic power by 1901. Delvaux thrived honoring the grandeur, tradition and symbols of Belgium and earning the title of &amp;quot;royal warrant holder of the court of Belgium.&amp;quot; Because as King Leopold II famously proclaimed, &amp;quot;The nation of Rubens must be as great in its art as in its commerce and industry.&amp;quot;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="KARL LAGERFELD’S CHANEL GIRLS">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>The creative force and genius of <strong>Karl Lagerfeld</strong> goes beyond the endless blockbuster collections he has designed for <strong>Chanel</strong> in his trend-shaping career. Equally successful are his girls, or A-list <strong>muses</strong>, who the Kaiser launched and by whom he was inspired. Ladies who have swung through the doors of Rue Cambon, the storied Chanel atelier in Paris, with elegance and grace, leaving a mark in the Maison&amp;rsquo;s imagery. From sexed-up Nineties supermodels to Oscar-winning actresses to doll-faced beauties, Lagerfeld&amp;rsquo;s tastes were also showcased at the Mademoiselle Priv&amp;eacute; exhibition in London last year, a journey through Chanel&amp;rsquo;s creations that captured the irreverent spirit and legacy of Mademoiselle Chanel and of Lagerfeld, also through a flurry of muses - <strong>Kristen Stewart,&amp;nbsp;Lily-Rose Depp,&amp;nbsp;Vanessa Paradis,&amp;nbsp;Keira Knightley,&amp;nbsp;Stella Tennant, Lily Collins, Gisele B&amp;uuml;ndchen,&amp;nbsp;Claudia Schiffer and&amp;nbsp;Julianne Moore, </strong>among others.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>More recently, Lagerfeld&amp;rsquo;s fascination with <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, who debuted with the Chanel Fall 2014 show, has fueled the whirlwind modeling career of the sexy brunette. Not by chance she is good friends with <strong>Cara Delevingne</strong>, who regardless of the fact that she has put her modeling career on hold, always manages to find time to open and close Lagerfeld&amp;rsquo;s shows.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A short mop of dark hair characterizes two of Lagerfeld&amp;rsquo;s most iconic muses of the past. In the Eighties, long before Jenner and Delevingne, <strong>In&amp;egrave;s de la Fressange</strong> was Lagerfeld&amp;rsquo;s haute lady, an icon of the house, of Parisian style and natural elegance. Ditto for the aristocratic beauty and glamour of&amp;nbsp; <strong>Stella Tennant</strong>, who signed an exclusive contract with the house in 1996. The androgynous, bold and singular looks of Freja Beha Erichsen and Saskia De Braw also wooed Lagerfeld, their strong personalities switching from manly tailoring to romantic bridal swooshes with nonchalance and ease.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As different as frost from fire were supermodels <strong>Claudia Schiffer</strong>, the bombshell blonde of the Eighties, and <strong>Linda Evangelista</strong>, who Lagerfeld met in 1985. From sexed-up to toughed-up contemporary glamour, they both became household names in the early Nineties.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Starting on April 23 through May 8,  Milan  will host  “Fierce and Fragile: Big Cats in the Art,”  an exhibition showcasing the works of the late French artist  Robert Dallet.  On display at the Galleria d’Arte Moderna (Gam), it is organized by&nbsp; Hermès  in partnership with  Panthera , a conservation foundation established in 2006. 

 The showcase’s goal is to save and raise awareness on the importance to the ecosystem of  wild cats  - tigers, lions, jaguars, snow leopards, leopards, cheetahs, cougars and clouded leopards – which Dallet captured incessantly, transposing their feline power and elusiveness on paper and canvas. For years, Dallet travelled to Africa to study their movements and hunting habits. The exhibit features over 60 of Dallet’s drawings, sketches and paintings, as well as the scarves he designed for Hermès, starting in with “Kenya” in 1988. From a very early age, the big cats were a muse and passion for Dallet, inspiring his works throughout his career.

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Forget staying local when it comes to  Cruise  shows. Exotic or old-world charm is more like it for storied fashion houses such as  Dior, Chanel, Gucci and Louis Vuitton,  which continue to pick high-impact destinations for their Cruise extravaganzas, unscathed by shelling out the big bucks.&nbsp; 

 The latest is  Nicolas Ghesquière  who chose the  Niterói Contemporary Art Museum  in  Rio de Janeiro , Brazil, to stage the  Louis Vuitton Cruise   2017  show. This is probably the first time that the space-age looking landmark by renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer welcomes a fashion show. It certainly will be the first time for the  Cloisters at Westminster Abbey  in June when  Gucci ’ s  creative director Alessandro Michele will pack up his Cruise 2017 collection to show in one of London’s most historic and suggestive locations. Conversely, when at the end of May  Dior  will unveil its Cruise collection at the historic&nbsp; Blenheim Palace &nbsp;in  Oxfordshire , England, it will be the third time for the storied French house, which showed in the residence of the&nbsp;Duke of Marlborough&nbsp;and&nbsp;the birthplace of Winston Churchill in 1954 and 1958. 

 From misty England to sundrenched Havana, Cuba, for  Chanel’s  spectacle. 

 Past locations for top houses include New York’s DIA-Art Foundation, the Lido of Venice at sunset, a journey through Rome’s hidden temples, Pierre Cardin’s&nbsp; Bubble house near Cannes, the quaint Portofino, Seoul and Dubai. So buckle up gang…it’s take off time.

No wonder they are the ultimate must-haves for the likes of<em> Lapo Elkann, Pharrell Williams, Alex Rodriguez and LeBron James, among others. </em>Del Toro&amp;rsquo;s overall aesthetic amalgamates Chevallard&amp;rsquo;s Italian heritage, a Palm Beach prep aesthetic from his childhood and an edgy New York and Japanese street style.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>According to a report conducted by <strong>Exane Bnp Paribas</strong>, global luxurygoods companies are increasingly shifting their focus, and ad budgets, from print to digital via social media outlets. Without question <strong>Instagram</strong> leads the pack. Designers choose the image-centric app because it fuels engagement and buzz with its followers, especially in terms of likes and comments. The study highlights how the top brands to catalyze traffic include Michael Kors, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Dolce&amp;amp;Gabbana, Gucci, Tiffany, Prada and Burberry. In a similar trend, the idea of using <strong>WhatsApp</strong> to send out breaking news alerts is also picking up steam. After The Huffington Post and BBC, British Vogue has jumped on the bandwagon and during New York Fashion Week sent&amp;nbsp;the latest runway looks and fashion news to followers&amp;rsquo; phones. The type of content ranges from the appointment of a new creative director to red-carpet dressing at the Oscars.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p><strong>Riccardo Tisci&amp;rsquo;s</strong> second collaboration with Nike has brought to life the <strong>NikeLab Dunk Lux High x RT</strong> high top. Conversely to its lengthy name, the full-grain leather shoe is a case of essential edge with a <strong>no-fuss black tonal</strong> silhouette accented by a demonstrative big-belly white Swoosh. Similarly to Tisci&amp;rsquo;s reinterpretation of the Air Force 1 in 2014, the Dunk Lux also reflects the Givenchy designer&amp;rsquo;s passion for basketball. Signature features of the shoe&amp;rsquo;s sports-style innovation are the drop-in Lunarlon insole for ultra-soft cushioning and memory foam in the quilted leather collar and tongue for a secure and comfortable fit.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;ldquo;The Nike Dunk has a fascinating legacy,&amp;rdquo; says <strong>Tisci.</strong> &amp;ldquo;It has&amp;nbsp;been both mainstream and niche, adopted by communities of varying size and influence. But no matter the model, the Dunk has always had a cultural cachet that, as a designer, I&amp;rsquo;m quite drawn to.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>According to <strong>Nate Jobe, Senior Design Director of NikeLab Footwear Innovation</strong>, the shoe not only needed to convey Riccardo&amp;rsquo;s creative interpretation of it, but it also needed to perform. &amp;ldquo;Through close collaboration we were able to put a new spin on a Nike icon, while still delivering the function needed for all-day wear,&amp;rdquo; he says.</p>

Within a showcase designed by sculptor Manfred Pernice, the show stretches out over two levels, covering the Nord gallery and the Cinema. It runs through Aug. 28. &amp;nbsp;The exhibit includes more than <strong>90 works</strong> produced by over <strong>60 artists</strong> from 1820 until today. Demand&amp;rsquo;s idea was to show and explore how we all rely on pre-existing models, and how artists have always referred to existing imagery to make their own. Questioning the boundaries between originality, conceptual inventiveness and the culture of the copy, the project focuses on theft, authorship, annexation and the creative potential of such pursuits. The first section of the exhibition displays photographs, paintings and films in which the stolen or missing object becomes the scene or evidence of a crime. The second part analyzes the logic behind appropriation within the creative process while part number three deals with the production of images that reveal hidden aspects on both a private or public level. Among the artists included are Maurizio Cattelan, Richard Artschwager, Adolph von Menzel and Gerhard Richter, Haris Epaminonda, Alice Lex-Nerlinger and John Stezaker, Sara Cwynar, Mathew Hale, Oliver Laric and Elad Lassry, John Baldessari and Sophie</p>

<p>Whichever, <strong>Demna Gvasalia&amp;rsquo;s</strong> debut collection for <strong>Balenciaga</strong> was one of the most buzzed-about events of Paris fashion week. And it rocked. Proving he was perfectly up to the challenge, the founder of the hot Vetements brand sought to distill the essence of Cristobal Balenciaga, mixing it with a totally au courant and fresh streetwear vibe. The starting point was his signature list of key pieces &amp;ndash; floral dresses, tailored jackets, car coats and longish skirts, readapted with plush fabrics, attitude and embellishments.&amp;nbsp; Gvasalia also worked the legendary designer&amp;rsquo;s tailoring acumen by serving up the suit, as in the jacket-and-skirt combo with modernity and sexiness.</p>

<p>But who exactly is Gvasalia? Born in Georgia, Gvasalia founded <a href='http://www.vogue.co.uk/brand/vetements'><strong>Vetements</strong></a>&amp;nbsp;in 2014 as a design collective with his brother Guram. &amp;nbsp;The idea was to create a democratic, product-driven label, hinged on an uber-cool mix of cultures, street beat, real life and the internet, interpreted with year-round standalone pieces. A desirable, sassy and contemporary wardrobe for all. In only 18 months, the Vetements shows have become a high-wattage event, his appointment at Balenciaga further heightening &amp;nbsp;his boiling hot success. The low-profile Gvasalia is a graduate from the <strong>Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp</strong>. He designed the women&amp;rsquo;s wear line for Maison Martin Margiela and served as chief women&amp;rsquo;s wear designer at Louis Vuitton.&amp;nbsp;</p>

After all, the apple doesn&amp;#39;t fall far from the tree.</p>

<p>Take <strong>Brooklyn Beckham</strong>, for example, whose fledgling modelling career was boosted by an appearance in the Wake Up video of British boy band The Vamps. Besides his good looks and one million Instagram followers, the 16-year-old son of Victoria and David Beckham, performed some impressive stunt work and parkour tricks.</p>

<p>Actors <strong>Dylan and Hopper Penn</strong>, instead, front the <a href='http://wwd.com/tag/fay-2/'>Fay</a> (Tod&amp;rsquo;s Group) advertising campaign for spring/Summer 2016. The undertaking marks the first time the offspring of Sean Penn and Robin Wright have worked together. They were photographed in Palm Springs by Michelangelo di Battista.</p>

<p><strong>Lourdes Leon</strong>, Madonna&amp;rsquo;s daughter, was tapped by Stella McCartney to appear as one of four models in the ad campaign for the designer&amp;rsquo;s new fragrance called Pop. Leon shares the set with Amandla Stenberg, the actress, comic book writer and activist; singer Claire Boucher, aka as Grimes, and <strong>Kenya Kinski-Jones</strong>, daughter of Quincy Jones and Nastassja Kinski. McCartney chose the girls based on their strong character, influence and personality. The images were shot by Glen Luchford as a road trip in the American desert with the girls carefreely prancing around.</p>

<p>The striking case of resemblance between <strong>Kaia Gerber</strong> and former supermodel <strong>Cindy Crawford</strong> led to the mother-and-daughter cover of Vogue France shot by Mario Testino. Their matching black leather jackets and hoop earrings further enhances the likeness. The 14-year-old Gerber has quickly scaled the modelling ranks appearing as the face of Alexander Wang&amp;rsquo;s campaigns and in Carine Roitfeld&amp;rsquo;s book <em>CR Fashion Book</em>.</p>

<p>Ditto for the sweet-faced <strong>Lily-Rose Depp</strong>, the 16-year-old daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, whose similitude with her mother is impressive. Her fast-moving career includes walking <a href='http://www.vogue.co.uk/miss-vogue/fashion/2015/07/lily-rose-depp-catwalk-debut-chanel'>in the Chanel couture show</a> as the brand&amp;rsquo;s ambassador,&amp;nbsp;<a href='http://www.vogue.co.uk/miss-vogue/whats-up/2015/05/celebrity-music-video-cameos/gallery/1441087'>starring in a music video</a>&amp;nbsp;and a working on her fledgling acting career as she will &amp;nbsp;play Isadora Duncan in the upcoming movie&amp;nbsp;<em>The Dancer </em>directed by Stephanie Di Guosto.</p>

I&amp;#39;m able to get insight that could only come from him because he has an insane eye for design and is a passionate runner.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>So 12 collections down, NikeLab and Takahashi continue to blaze new trails by melding performance and aesthetic. For Spring 2016, that means gearing up for disparate weather conditions with water-resistant materials and pockets that allow for quick and efficient storage of outer layers. Sneaker heads can indulge with the new <strong>LunarEpic Flyknit</strong> &amp;nbsp;featuring mid-height collar for a locked-down fit and a laser-cut contoured Lunarlon midsole. The pods on the outsole enhance cushioning and multi-surface traction.</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="THE GUCCI RESURGENCE ">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>&amp;ldquo;The words we keep hearing about are joy and optimism. I really give a lot of credit to <strong>Alessandro Michele</strong> at <strong>Gucci</strong> for being so bold and brilliant with his reset at Gucci.&amp;rdquo; So says <strong>Anna Wintour</strong> in a YouTube video on the Fall/Winter 2016-17 Milan season for Vogue Runway.</p>

<p>The powerful Vogue editor is only one of the voices in a choir of press, retailers and celebrities that have profusely praised the work of Alessandro Michele since his appointment as Gucci Creative Director early last year. Many claim that Michele is leading the Milan revival, spurring other designers to put looks on the runway that typically don&amp;rsquo;t belong to the city&amp;rsquo;s fashion week.</p>

<p>Certainly, the most buzzed-about designer has rocked fashion, catapulting the brand back into the limelight and setting the stage for the <strong>genderless</strong> trend for which he and she blurred on many catwalks worldwide. The sultry Gucci goddesses, decked-out in high-glam attire from the Tom Ford and Frida Giannini era, have dissolved, replaced by eccentric and quirky chic nerds with a romantic-meets-dandy allure. Michele&amp;rsquo;s vision is without a doubt more tender yet his creatures are anything but soft. His clothes are beautiful, skillfully executed with bravado and mastery where references and periods &amp;ndash; Renaissance-meets-streetwear, for example - are mixed-and-matched liberally to striking effect.</p>

<p>Flowers, bees, snakes and butterflies are embroidered or appliqued on skirts, jackets and dresses. Fabrics are rich and textured, the color palette captivating. The accessories are strong and decorative. Yet, even with his 360-degree transformation, Michele always weaves in the Gucci heritage, interpreting the archival references with a new and fresh perspective. Keep it up, Alessandro.&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>The <strong>Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan</strong> is hosting <strong>The Women of Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar, 1936-1958</strong> exhibition dedicated to the dynamic teamwork between the magazine&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;editor-in-chief <strong>Carmel Snow</strong>, fashion editor <strong>Diana Vreeland</strong>, and photographer <strong>Louise Dahl-Wolfe</strong>. For 22 years, this visionary trio transformed&amp;nbsp;<em>Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar</em>&amp;nbsp;into the number one American fashion magazine thanks to a mix of fresh, avant-garde, playful and sophisticated content that besides fashion included political matters, family, art and even yoga. As Snow once claimed, Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar was a publication for &amp;ldquo;well-dressed women with well-dressed minds.&amp;rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibition runs until <strong>April 2</strong> and comes in advance of <em>Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar</em><em>&amp;rsquo;</em>s 150th anniversary next year. The display features old magazines, personal notes, video clips and archival designer pieces that highlight the strong and daring personalities of the three women, all eager to support and push new talent.</p>

<p>Snow, an in-charge personality who hardly slept and ate but had a weak spot for Martinis, is credited for having brought photojournalist Martin Munkacsi to a windswept beach to shoot a swimwear feature. As the model ran toward the camera, Munkacsi snapped a shot that revolutionized fashion-magazine history, until then primarily carefully staged on mannequin-like models in a studio. The trio&amp;rsquo;s longstanding collaboration ended with Snow&amp;#39;s retirement in 1957. She was 70 years old.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="EXCLUSIVE: FRANCESCO RUSSO FOR ANTONIA">
		<meta property="og:description" content="  Francesco Russo  thrives on the intimate  one-on-one  relationship he has created with his clients, firmly eschewing the more, more, more orgy that is riddling the fashion industry.&nbsp; “Luxury just can’t be fast, delivered in every corner of the world and loved by all. It takes time to make a labor-intensive&nbsp; shoe that becomes a desirable investment piece that should last in time,” says Francesco Russo in an exclusive interview for Antonia. 

 In a world obsessed with big numbers, fast-paced timing and global growth, Russo opts for  bespoke  craftsmanship, blending  tradition  and  modernity , elegance and experimentation. 

 The collaboration with  Antonia  for a  limited-edition sandal  reflects the mo. of two visionaries in their respective fields. “(Antonia and I) have known each other from the very beginning and we’ve always had a stimulating dialogue, just like the exchange of ideas we had for this collaboration,” says Russo.&nbsp; Similarly to the relationship he develops with his clients in his Paris boutique/atelier, Russo seals a special relationship with his top retail partners. With Antonia he developed an exclusive, sexy and totally au courant sandal, in red, black and white, that he describes as an “asymmetrical T-strap with transparent PVC details.” &nbsp; 

 Since branching out on his own in 2013, the inventive shoe maker, whose background includes key stints at Dior, Miu Miu, Yves Saint Laurent and Dior, believes in the appeal of bespoke shoes. “From the beginning I wanted to recreate a Fifties approach, when women would get their shoes custom-made, choosing among a few selected models that they could customize to their taste,” says Russo, whose aesthetic is in fact based on a handful of focused and timeless shapes.&nbsp;

As reported in the story, the chamber’s president  Ralph Toledano  and key industry execs still view the current format as valid. The winning formula is driven by a top-performing and healthy French luxurygoods sector. Hence, the Paris runway shows will continue to be staged one season before the collections hit the stores. 
The fashion houses on the federation’s board that want to keep the current system are Dior, Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Nina Ricci, Hermès, Chloé, Agnes b., Issey Miyake, Isabel Marant, Balenciaga, Lanvin, Sonia Rykiel, Leonard, Dries Van Noten, Maison Margiela, Paul Smith and Kenzo. Conversely Tom Ford and Burberry have opted for showing in-season collections in London, or presenting the Fall/Winter 2016-17 line-ups in September for them to be in stores right after. The saga is bound to continue…

According to Kering Group&amp;rsquo;s sales results, the storied Florentine house saw a return to growth in 2015, with a progressive increase in sales fueled by its directly-operated stores in both consolidated and emerging markets. Gucci&amp;rsquo;s new era, praised by the press, buyers and customers, coupled with the rapid roll-out of the brand&amp;#39;s new strategy from the first half of the year, provided fresh impetus and drove solid, promising performances also in the fourth quarter of the year.<br />
In 2015, Kering&amp;#39;s Luxury activities posted revenues of 7.8 billion, up 16.4% compared to the previous year. Fran&amp;ccedil;ois-Henri Pinault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: &amp;quot;Kering&amp;#39;s solid 2015 results reflect brisk sales and improved operating performances in the second half of the year.<br />
These results come amid a more complex economic and geopolitical environment, accentuating the shifts taking place in our sector. We are entering a new phase in our growth: we are perfectly positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and maximise value creation over the long term. We are closely monitoring resource and capital allocation in order to bolster returns. I am confident that the work of our creative teams and the commitment of all our associates will enable us to extend our growth trajectory in 2016 and beyond.&amp;quot;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>From the big city bustle to a moment of monastic calm. After showing at New York&amp;rsquo;s DIA- Art Foundation last season, <strong>Gucci</strong>&amp;rsquo;s creative director Alessandro Michele has switched gears and on <strong>June 2nd</strong> will show his Cruise 2017 collection at the <strong>Cloisters at</strong> <strong>Westminster Abbey</strong>, one of London&amp;rsquo;s most historic and suggestive locations. It is the first time that Gucci stages a runway show in this unique and exclusive location.</p>

<p><strong>Cloister curiosity</strong>: In the pre-Reformation days, the Cloister was one of the busiest parts of the monastic precincts, quite cozy with its glass windows, rushes strewn on the floor and braziers burning. It was used by the monks for meditation and exercise, besides providing access to the main monastic buildings. The cloisters, named after the four cardinal points, served different purposes &amp;ndash; the west walk was where the novices were instructed by the Novice Master, the north walk was for private study, south was the way to the Refectory where meals were taken while the east walk led to the Chapter House. The Cloisters were rebuilt after the Great Fire of 1298.</p>

And hopefully for his fans, not the last.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Ladies first. So, after a domino-effect exodus at key women&amp;rsquo;s fashion brands (Alber Elbaz leaving Lanvin, Raf Simons out at Dior and Hedi Slimane exiting Saint Laurent), the shake-up has now moved into men&amp;rsquo;s wear. To wit, Stefano Pilati is leaving Ermenegildo Zegna after a three-year tenure aimed at elevating the label&amp;rsquo;s fashion bar while Brendan Mullane and Brioni apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t reach an agreement to renew the designer&amp;rsquo;s contract, sealed four years ago. Last but not least, Alessandro Sartori has resigned from Berluti, where he was tapped five years ago by Antoine Arnault to turn the storied label into a lifestyle brand. Previously Sartori was the creative director of Z Zegna, Zegna&amp;rsquo;s more trend-driven brand, launched in 2003 while Pilati was the creative mind at Yves Saint Laurent. Mullane instead has worked in key roles at Givenchy, Herm&amp;egrave;s, Louis Vuitton and Burberry. Needless to say, the hunt for their successors is on.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading luxurygoods group, posted revenues of  €35.7 billion in 2015 , a  16%  increase over the previous year. Organic growth advanced 6%. The momentum is led by strong performances in  Europe , the  U.S  and  Japan  while Asia recorded a slowdown. In the fashion and accessories arena, LVMH’s growth was fueled by a handful of key points: the success of both iconic and new products at Louis Vuitton, where profitability remains at an exceptional level; bullish progress at Fendi, Céline, Givenchy and Kenzo; a remarkable momentum at Christian Dior; excellent results at Bvlgari and the success of TAG Heuer’s refocusing strategy. 
 
Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said:  “The 2015 results confirm the capacity for LVMH to progress and gain market share despite economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Revenue and operating profit reached new record levels. Commitment to excellence, a passion for quality and our capacity to innovate underpin our growth momentum…All our Maisons demonstrated outstanding flexibility in 2015…In an uncertain economic environment, we can rely on the desirability of our brands and the agility of our teams to further strengthen in 2016 our leadership in the world of high quality products.”

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Running around during fashion week is as glamorous as it is stressful, the Fall/Winter 2016-17 men&amp;rsquo;s season being no exception. From runway to showroom, a buyer&amp;rsquo;s agenda is packed with round-the-clock appointments to view, choose and buy the latest collections. But amidst all the frenzy, being in Paris means visiting unexpected and often memorable locations, the perfect backdrop to communicate the collections&amp;rsquo; vision and message. Here are our top three.</p>

<p><br />
ATTACHMENT &amp;ndash; Few settings are more appropriate than the stark and airy La Galerie D&amp;rsquo;Architecture space for the presentation of the fall Attachment collection, once again true to its signature less-is-more Japanese aesthetic. The brand&amp;rsquo;s clean-cut silhouettes, great fits, tight color palette and amazing eye for detail, from the zip to the button, blended seamlessly with the contemporary, all-white art space in the heart of the Marais, at 11 Rue des Blancs Manteaux.</p>

<p>SACAI - Imagine a historical palazzo on a quaint 17th century street whose entrance features a mammoth strobe light, in all its glittering and mirrored dazzle. In this past-meets-disco ambience at 5 Rue du Mail, featuring white-washed walls and original honey-tinged parquet floors, Sacai presented its new Fall Winter collection to its buyers. With a controlled and experimental hand, designer Chitose Abe played with layers, lengths and contrasting textures for a strong message.</p>

<p>FAITH CONNEXION - The Faith Connexion team chose the Hotel Pourtales, on Rue Tronchet, to showcase the new fall line-up. This historic yet off- the-radar hotel channels an old-world charm with its gilded details, frescoes and plush velvets. Indeed, a frost-from-fire contrast compared to the collection&amp;rsquo;s one-of-a-kind pieces by graffiti artists who liberally reworked coated jeans, glitter, grunge-influences and extra giant tops. For sure, an interesting connexion.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content=" Cool and urban, the new season at Neil Barrett brings a fresh crop of the designer’s revisited best-selling classics, this time in a tightly-edited palette of navy, indigo, black and white. Barrett’s potpourri of patterns flowed easily and gained personality with his signature selection of experimental textures and fabrics. Shorts, low-crotch pants with rolled-up hems, easy silhouettes and spring’s hot novelty - sleeveless V-neck tunics - all made for an innovative and distinctive line-up. In short, the perfect pieces to punch up last season’s staples.

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Hours after Karl Lagerfeld showed another blockbuster Chanel Couture show, the luxurygoods house confirmed the exit of Maureen Chiquet, global chief executive officer since 2007.<br />
The high-profile American-born executive, formerly at Gap, will leave at the end of the month. The reason seems to be differing views on the strategic direction of the company. Her role will be assumed by Alain Wertheimer, whose family co-controls Chanel, and whose fortunes make him one of the richest men in France. According to various press reports, the fashion group praised the 52-year-old Chiquet for the house&amp;rsquo;s successful international expansion and for having enhanced its luxury positioning and timeless image, growing the business across all categories.</p>

She effortlessly merged a laid-back sporty urban feel with tribal influences, obviously influenced by the designer&amp;rsquo;s bohemian upbringing. To wit, her crocheted tops, ruffled jacquard blouses, billowy dresses, low-crotch pants and tribal-printed peasant tops are yet another testament of her knack for that cool nomad vibe.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>According to <strong>iReaserch</strong>, the leading market research firm focusing on the Chinese internet industry, online sales in <strong>China</strong> continued to grow in 2015 thanks to an expanding mobile user base. <strong>Online shopping</strong> gross merchandise value, or GMV, grew 37.2 percent according to the report, which also underscores that as the online shopping market matures, e-commerce players will continue to develop merchandise categories and optimize logistics and after-sales services. <strong>Mobile shopping</strong> GMV, instead, advanced a whopping 123.2 percent. According to iResearch, mobile devices are on the upswing as they are characterized by portability, fragmented usage and immediate interaction. These factors facilitate integration between online and offline purchasing and social activities. On-line-to-off-line sales, or O2O, sales are also on the rise and expected to double by 2017.</p>

A mix between a personal diary and a spring 2016 fashion tome called Gaga&amp;rsquo;s Fashion Guard, the various covers are a tribute to the people that have played a major role in her life. They include the late Isabella Blow and Alexander McQueen, her dog Asia, Daphne Guiness, Hedi Slimane and Karl Lagerfeld. Needless to say, each one is different in look yet equally powerful.<br />
<br />

				<meta property="og:title" content="WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF RUNWAY SHOWS?">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>The future of fashion shows in a chaotic system characterized by frenetic production cycles, by out-of-control social media hype and by ultra-stimulated consumers is a question posed by WWD to key industry figures. Should they open to the public? If so, how? To that end, the Council of Fashion Designers of America proposed a movement this week toward turning the bi-yearly fashion shows into events for the consumers besides just for industry insiders by presenting in-season collections that are already in store.<br />
The <a href='http://wwd.com/tag/cfda/'>CFDA</a>&amp;nbsp;has hired Boston Consulting Group to conduct an extensive study to define the future of fashion shows. The result, says <strong>WWD</strong>, should be released in February. One of the main problem seems to be that the fashion cycle is essentially off kilter what with furs in store in July and swimsuits on display in December. Markdowns are rampant because selling at full-price is becoming tougher and tougher. Plus, consumers see images on Instagram and Twitter of runway looks that aren&amp;rsquo;t available in stores for another six months. So they get bored.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="DIOR DESIGN TEAM TO TAKE THE CREATIVE REINS">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>The name game at <strong>Dior </strong>will have to wait a bit longer. Following the departure of Raf Simons in November, according to WWD, the storied French label has handed the creative helm to its <strong>in-house design studio</strong> that will be in charge of the spring 2016 couture collection and the fall 2016 ready-to-wear line-up.<br />
Already, Dior&amp;rsquo;s established and large team took the lead after John Galliano was ousted in 2011. Over the years, Dior has implemented its design studio to support the growing and fast-paced demand for product.&amp;nbsp;The move suggests that appointing a marquee name with all the hoopla it implies isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the mo. of today. While heavy hitters such as Alber Elbaz and Olivier Rousteing still top the rumor list of possible Dior successors, the overnight promotion of Alessandro Michele at Gucci, until then an anonymous assistant of Frida Giannini, underlines how there is no real trend.</p>

For Cruise 2016, the designer was inspired by Anita Pallenberg, the actress and model from the Sixties and Seventies, who dated Keith Richards. A muse for many, Pallenberg&amp;rsquo;s look was and is still is considered effortlessly and intriguingly cool.</p>

<p>For her Resort collection, Ellery reworked that rock-chick vibe, plus Pallenberg&amp;rsquo;s lesser-known fascination with the occult, via a host of feminine pieces such as cropped bell-shaped trousers, ruffled-sleeved jackets and fluid dresses in a sleek palette of white and black with flashes of color.</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="INSIDE OUT: FRANCESCO RAGAZZI ON PALM ANGELS">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>It all started with one image.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;<br />
It was one picture I took one summer that made me go back to Los Angeles over and over again. It was a vision in my mind. Blond hair floating in the air, rays of light that capture bodies fighting over gravity. For some religions, this is the portrayal of the Angels. For me, it was a beginning.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;<br />
So says <strong>Francesco Ragazzi</strong> in his book<strong> Palm Angels,</strong> a collection of photographs that depict the skater life in Los Angeles. From the book, which includes a foreword by Pharrell Williams (a hard-core skater aka as Skateboard P) to a namesake fashion line, launched earlier this year. Palm Angels, in fact, is the brainchild of <strong>Moncler</strong> art director Francesco Ragazzi, who began shooting the <strong>L.A</strong>. skateboarding scene during his many trips to the West Coast, capturing the style and street culture of the world&amp;rsquo;s top skaters. Today the ultra-buzzed Palm Angels line inspired by the skater world a Seventies vibe with a dash of urban preppy cool, making it really unique. High quality closet staples such as Tees and sweatshirts, printed with images from the book, at a competitive price. Here we discuss the skater influence on fashion with Francesco Ragazzi.</p>

<p>Here we discuss the skater influence on fashion with Francesco Ragazzi.</p>

<p><strong>How has the skate community influenced the fashion industry?</strong><br />
I think skaters are taking the spot that the rock and roll and grunge communities had in the Nineties Their world is authentic and this is what people need now. In L.A everything is concentrated and you can really get the vibe because the style and the skaters&amp;rsquo; attitude is genuine. We have yet to see what this culture can bring in terms of influence.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What differentiates the skating community from other realities?<br />
&amp;nbsp;</strong>It&amp;rsquo;s really transversal. Skateboarding is a mean of transportation, a sport, an attitude. It&amp;rsquo;s also a valid perspective on life &amp;ndash; the more you try the better you become.</p>

<p><strong>How does the look of hot young skateboarders impact high fashion? </strong><br />
There are many brands inspired by this culture - Marc Jacobs and Celine are the first that come to mind. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how high fashion is contaminated by a world normally considered cheap. This is thanks to its authenticity. The fashion world is going through a big change as brands are influenced by the streets and its subcultures. I think about Givenchy, County of Milan, Off White or Hba.</p>

<p><strong>What most inspires the Palm Angels collections?&amp;nbsp;</strong><br />
The L.A DNA ingrained in this sport, the timeless style, the attitude, the typical Californian look with long blonde hair, this is what inspires me the most. There is a special vibe in the air, I felt it immediately and as soon as I saw my first pictures, this influence never left me.&amp;nbsp;<br />
A globetrotter constantly on the go,Ragazzi shares his favorite spots when in L.A, from the known to the unknown.</p>

A classic attitude with a bad-girl-punkish streak set off by the iconic creeper platform sole and suede upper. The <strong>PUMA Creeper </strong>is the brainchild of PUMA&amp;rsquo;s Creative Director, Rihanna, and is part of the PUMA by RIHANNA Collection under the <strong>FENTY Label</strong>. In the Seventies, the original Puma suede sneaker immediately became a favorite of athletes and a cult item among generations with a rebellious streak, from hip hop to skaters.&amp;nbsp;<br />
Bold yet impossibly stylish, the creeper is back and here to stay.</p>

Besides Hardy, whose bold geometric designs made headlines from the beginning, other names include <strong>Manolo Blahnik,&amp;nbsp; Vivienne Westwood, Patrick Cox, Martin Margiela and&amp;nbsp;</strong><a href='http://www.wallpaper.com/fashion/rendez-vous-roger-viviers-demi-couture-collection-embarks-on-its-latest-world-tour/7154'><strong>Roger Vivier, alongside </strong></a><strong>the more contemporary Simone Rocha and Tabitha Simmons.</strong> On Dec. 13, Hardy will give a talk at the MoMu as part of the&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Talking Heads Talking Shoes&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;series running alongside the exhibition.</p>

Guests included LVMH chief <strong>Bernard Arnault, Karl Lagerfeld</strong>, Italy&amp;rsquo;s minister of reforms <strong>Maria Elena Boschi</strong> and <strong>Carla Fendi</strong>. The opening ceremony featured <strong>Poesia di Luce</strong>, a powerful lighting installation by artist Mario Nanni with sunset hues and flapping birds projected across the fa&amp;ccedil;ade.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know</strong>&amp;hellip;that the Palazzo della Civilt&amp;agrave; Italiana is also known as Colosseo Quadrato&amp;nbsp;(<em>Square Colosseum</em>). An icon of Fascist architecture, it was conceived in 1935 by Benito Mussolini&amp;nbsp;for the Esposizione Universale di Roma, the universal exposition that never took place because of the war. Designed by architects Giovanni Guerrini,Ernesto Bruno La Padula&amp;nbsp;and Mario Romano, it was inaugurated in 1940. Inspired by the Colosseum,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the facade of the Palazzo della Civilt&amp;agrave; features a series of superimposed loggias displayed in six rows of nine arches each. These numbers are said to be an allusion to the name of the Fascist dictator: &amp;quot;Benito&amp;quot; having six letters and &amp;quot;Mussolini,&amp;quot; nine.</p>

<p>Barely used since World War II, thanks to Fendi, it&amp;rsquo;s now living a second life.&amp;nbsp;</p>

The latest venture is with Gucci, which chose Antonia to create a special window installation for an exclusive preview dedicated to the Cruise 2016 collection. Part of an ongoing retail project for Gucci, the display further underscores the house&amp;rsquo;s new brand vision and direction masterminded by Creative Director <strong>Alessandro Michele</strong> since his arrival earlier this year. It will be unveiled on<strong> Sept. 23 </strong>until the <strong>28th</strong>.<br />
Lively and eye-catching, the setting mirrors Michele&amp;rsquo;s ability to blur the line between legacy and currency, channeling the urban romanticism of the Cruise 2016 fashion show held in New York in June. To wit, the red-carpeted display features walls and chairs covered by the red herbarium print, which also upholsters the tailoring busts. A range of colourful and exquisitely-embellished Dionysus handbags, complemented by shoes and ready-to-wear, sit neatly on chairs creating a gentle yet utterly modern effect.</p>

Tisci chose to show in New York because it&amp;rsquo;s a city he loves, one that constantly kindles his creativity via its energy and culture. Well-aware of the deep significance of the date to Americans, he plans to celebrate love and the family with a complex show/presentation.&amp;nbsp;</p>

				<meta property="og:title" content="EXCLUSIVE: Q&amp;A WITH PIERRE HARDY ON FALL AND HIS HOT SPOTS">
		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>Known for his standout designs, Pierre Hardy creates bold shoes and bags for men and women who beg to differ. As the fall mist rolls in, the French designer opted for distinct color contrasts, worked with both sexy stilettos and&amp;nbsp; a mod aesthetic interpreted with thick, square heels, color blocking and the odd touch of exotica. For men, his line-up channeled a gentleman&amp;rsquo;s allure, courtesy of a revised Anglo-Saxon elegance.&amp;nbsp;<br />
Here, the French designer shares his views on fashion, the season&amp;rsquo;s must-haves and where to go when in Paris.</p>

<p><strong>Describe the overall inspiration for Fall</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br />
Strong contrasts, unions between opposite universes. Cube lattice lace-up sandals that are both sensual and graphic, pumps with pompom ankle ties that mix Parisian chic with a touch of oriental eccentricity, or <em>trompe l&amp;rsquo;oeil &amp;ldquo;</em>absent&amp;rdquo; heels that make sandals seem as though they are suspended in mid air.&amp;nbsp;<br />
For men, it was about showcasing a gentlemanly allure, an Anglo-Saxon elegance (jodhpur boots with big buckles). Sneakers are simplified to ultra-graphic silhouettes, with lacing either hidden under a large Velcro strap or replaced by a single black elastic on new styles, a sort of throwback to the minimalist trend of the 90s.</p>

<p><strong>List three fall essentials - a color, a shape, a look</strong>&amp;nbsp;A look: Disco/oriental on high heel sandals with long tassels.</p>

<p>A shape: narrow fitted boot or ankle boot with elasticized leg.</p>

<p>A color: shades of camel in suede or snake.</p>

<p><strong>A book or CD you would recommend as the days get shorter </strong></p>

<p>Donna Summer &amp;ndash; still! I love disco and we all &amp;ldquo;feel love&amp;rdquo;!</p>

<p>James Salter&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Light Years,&amp;rdquo; the perfect portrait of what happiness could be and how it can fall apart.</p>

<p><strong>Dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts when in Paris</strong></p>

<p>DO: Walk or run on the banks of the Seine and then in the Tuileries Gardens, the most beautiful stadium in the world!&amp;nbsp;DON&amp;rsquo;T: Nothing is a &amp;lsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; in Paris &amp;ndash; I love everything (almost!)</p>

<p><strong>Your favorite off-the-beaten-track bistrot or restaurant in Paris&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>La Petite Table, 27 rue Saintonge</strong> - it is my local, literally next door. It&amp;rsquo;s cozy and well lit, with simple fresh Italian food and the kindest Italian owners.</p>

<p><strong>Caf&amp;eacute; Stern, Passage des Panoramas</strong> &amp;ndash; small and in a gorgeous setting, with delicious Venetian food.</p>

<p><strong>Le Dauphin, 131 avenue Parmentier</strong> &amp;ndash; I love the design by Rem Koolhaas and being able to choose many delicious small plates in any order is exactly how I like to eat.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>The first Cond&amp;egrave;&amp;nbsp;Nast&amp;nbsp;International luxury conference held in Florence and curated by Suzy Menkes, explored the impact of technology and social media on luxury through expert keynote speakers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin&amp;#39;s Alber Elbaz, David Lauren, Antoine Arnault, ceo of Berluti, Jonathan Ive,&amp;nbsp; Apple&amp;rsquo;s senior vice president of design and Isabelle Harvie-Watt, Global CEO Havas LuxHub.&amp;nbsp;<br />
The conference tackled a number of issues with insight and often humorous anecdotes. Elbaz, for example, joked about his difficulties with technology, especially complicated gadgets, while Lagerfeld underscored how he likes to keep everything his head and not on a computer.&amp;nbsp;<br />
Others admitted that while fashion lags behind in the <strong>technological revolution</strong>, technology in part replaces the glamour of fashion. Infact, many still believe in creativity and the need to create dreams versus marketing-centric strategies.&amp;nbsp;<br />
According to Harvie-Watt, &amp;nbsp;though, &amp;ldquo;technology isn&amp;rsquo;t an afterthought, it&amp;rsquo;s at the core of their business. Traditional luxury companies have yet to get there and digital commerce is still a single-digit percent of their business,&amp;rdquo; she said.&amp;nbsp;<br />
She also stressed how next-gen luxury consumers think about luxury in terms of experience and technology. &amp;ldquo;Instead of acquiring things, they&amp;rsquo;d rather activate. Rare and authentic experiences like running ice marathons in the Antarctic or climbing Kilimanjaro are the new bling,&amp;rdquo; she added.</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>From floppy hats to wide-brimmed fedoras, summer is unquestionably a hot hat season with countless variations appearing everywhere from the Coachella Music festival to the Riviera to the city streets. And when it comes to one-of-a-kind hats, the man leading the pack is<strong>California</strong>-based Nick Fouquet, also the hatmaker to the stars.<br />
With a following the caliber of&amp;nbsp;<strong>Madonna</strong>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<strong>Pharrell Williams</strong>, what sets this surfer-boy-meets-rebel guy apart are his unconventional methods for which he sets his hats on fire or hand paints them creating unique toppers.<br />
His elaborate techniques and&amp;nbsp;<strong>hand-made&amp;nbsp;</strong>workmanship are detailed, down to each hair of the eco-friendly beaver fur felt he uses, in a cool video that shows the making of Fouquet&amp;#39;s hats. The process of up to 20 steps includes cutting, hand-stitching, steaming, drying and sanding, plus a plethora of hand applied details. Hats off to this quirky designer who blends old world crafting with a fresh boho edge. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

		<meta property="og:description" content="<p>It&amp;rsquo;s Miss, Actually is the new Miss Dior film dedicated to the house&amp;#39;s iconic fragrance and starring Natalie Portman. Directed by Anton Corbijn, the Oscar-winning actress plays an elegant runaway bride torn between staying single vs a husband-and-wife responsibility. A mix of color and black and white flashes is used to alternate both scenarios, enhancing Portman&amp;#39;s beauty and her stunning embroidered wedding dress, which was in the works for over 600 hours. The clip unreels to the soundtrack of Janis Joplin&amp;rsquo;s Piece of My Heart in the background.</p>
