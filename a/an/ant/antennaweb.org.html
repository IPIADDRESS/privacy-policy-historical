            At <strong>TitanTV, Inc</strong>, we recognize the importance of privacy
            to users of AntennaWeb.org. This Privacy Policy explains what type of information
            may be collected from you when you access AntennaWeb.org and how that information
            may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy pertains only to AntennaWeb.org,

            <p class="resourcesTitle">Gathering of Information</p>
            <p>
                TITANTV may collect personally-identifying information from AntennaWeb.org for a variety
                of purposes. Such personally identifying information may include, but is not limited
                to, your address.
            </p>
            <p>
                TITANTV may ask you to provide certain personal information when you register for certain
                features or services that TITANTV may include AntennaWeb.org. TITANTV also may ask you to
                provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time
                the information is gathered. Any information that you submit on or through AntennaWeb.org
                may become public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like all other Web servers, TITANTV's Web server may automatically create log files
                for each user who accesses AntennaWeb.org. These "access logs" may allow TITANTV to
                make AntennaWeb.org more useful to our users. The access logs may record the identifier
                provided for your mobile device by your wireless carrier ("carrier identifier").
                Otherwise, the access logs do NOT record a user's name, address, e-mail address,
                credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they
                may contain some or all of the following information:<br>
                <br>
                </p><ul>
                    <li>
                        The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the device which downloaded, installed
                        or used the Mobile Application.

            <p class="resourcesTitle">Cookies and Other Technologies</p>
            <p>
                TITANTV may also use 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters
                that can be written to a file on the user's device when the user accesses AntennaWeb.org.
            </p>
            <p>
                TITANTV may use cookies to track users' activity through AntennaWeb.org in order to
                improve the site, the application architecture, to offer the features that would
                not be possible without them, to offer third party content, and to recall specific
                information to save the user time during subsequent use of AntennaWeb.org. For example,
                cookies may allow TITANTV to remember your (and/or your device’s) location. Interactive
                features may also use cookies. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship
                messages onto AntennaWeb.org, and third party vendors that measure and analyze the
                use of AntennaWeb.org for TITANTV, may also use their own cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                TITANTV and the third party vendors that measure and analyze use of AntennaWeb.org for
                TITANTV also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to help compile
                information about and facilitate usage of AntennaWeb.org. A web beacon is an electronic
                image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif., which can be used to recognize
                certain information on your device, such as cookies, the time and date of your actions
                within AntennaWeb.org, and a description of where content is placed. We may use
                web beacons on AntennaWeb.org from time to time for this and other purposes.

                We use several third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you access AntennaWeb.org.
                Some of these companies may use information about your visits to this and other

                TITANTV has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
                procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no
                Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free and TITANTV
                cannot guarantee that any information will be or remain safe or secure. Because
                most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special
                care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message,
