      <p class="latin">2.3 Information We share</p>
      <p>
          We do not share any of Your information with other companies, organizations and individuals unless one of the following circumstances apply:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <em>2.3.1 With Your consent</em>
              <p>
                  We will share Your information with companies, organizations and individuals outside the Company when We have Your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any personal information.

          <li>
              <em>2.3.2 For external processing</em>
              <p>
                  We employ trusted companies and individuals to perform functions on Our behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to Our databases and servers, which may contain personally identifying information about users. They may not use such access or information for any purpose other than that for which they are retained, and their process is based on Our instructions and in compliance with Our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

                      detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
                  </li>

                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected Users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
              </p>
          </li>

          <li>
              <em>2.4 Where Your information is located</em>
