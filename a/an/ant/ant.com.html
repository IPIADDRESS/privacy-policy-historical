          <li>
              <em>2.3.1 With Your consent</em>

                  We employ trusted companies and individuals to perform functions on Our behalf, such as technical support services.

                      detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected Users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
              </p>
          </li>

          <li>
