<p><strong>ANTARES AUDIO TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY EFFECTIVE DATE: 06/01/2007</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. INTRODUCTION. Auburn Audio Technologies, Inc. d.b.a. Antares Audio Technologies ("us," "we," or "Company") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website ("the Site"). We created this Website Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) TRAFFIC DATA COLLECTED. We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Site; and (4) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Site. We also use "cookies" to customize content specific to your interests.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED. In order for you to access certain services and to purchase products that we offer via the Site, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories of information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) COMPANY USE OF INFORMATION. We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or to contact you when necessary. We use your Financial Data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We do not share personal information with Third Parties to use for promotional purposes.  We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Demographic Data with other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e., non-personally-identifiable) basis. We also share Contact Data and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Company. In addition, we maintain a procedure for you to review and request changes to your Personal Information; this procedure is described in Section 3.1, below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) USER CHOICE REGARDING COLLECTION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information. You have the option to receive information concerning our products, including notices of free update releases and new product information, via the e-mail address you provide.  If you do not wish to receive this information, simply click "no" when asked if "It is OK to send these to you."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our Terms of Service. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are not accessible by third parties. We provide you with the capability to transmit you Personal Information via secured and encrypted channels if you use a similarly equipped web browser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION. We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm that your Personal Information remains correct and up-to-date. At any time, you may e-mail <a href="mailto:support@antarestech.com">support@antarestech.com</a>, to correct or change the information in our records.</p>

We may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY.
