		    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			
			<p><strong>Overview: </strong></p>
<p>Visionary Strategies LLC("Visionary Strategies", "Site," "we," "us," or "our") respects and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is  why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is intended to explain  our privacy practices and inform you as to: </p>
<ul>
<li>The kinds of personal information we collect from users of the Site and how that  information is collected; </li>
<li>How we use  your personal information; </li>
<li>The  circumstances under which we disclose personal information to third parties; </li>
<li>How you can  access, update or delete any personal information collected about you by us;  and </li>
<li>The  mechanisms we have implemented to protect your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We promise  that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are  compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only to transactions made and data gathered on web pages, newsletters, discussion lists  and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Visionary Strategies and does not apply to  any other transactions, information, web site or Internet, telephone or offline  point of contact between Visionary Strategies and you or other consumers. &nbsp;As we continue to develop our Site and take  advantage of technologies to improve the services we offer, this may change. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. &nbsp;We therefore encourage you to refer to this  policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. </p>
<p>This Site is  offered and made available only to users 18 years of age or older who reside in  the United States of America,  its territories and possessions ("U.S"). If you are not yet 18 years  old, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site  immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy,  please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require  you to provide your personal information. This Privacy Policy is a part of the  terms and conditions which are set forth in our Terms of Use Agreement. Both  the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.  By using this web site, you consent to this Agreement and to the collection and  use of information by Visionary Strategies as specified below.</p>
<p><strong>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong></p>
<p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of  numbers that serve as that computer’s "Internet Protocol" IP address.  When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Visionary Strategies Network, our  Web servers automatically recognize that visitor’s domain name and IP address.  The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the  IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to  examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Visionary Strategies Network,  its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate  this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail  addresses of the visitors.</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, Visionary Strategies or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your  computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a  Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie can’t read data  off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do  not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of Visionary Strategies’s Network  of Web sites you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those  pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to  ascertain how many times you’ve seen an advertisement. Visionary Strategies and/or our  advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content,  banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept  cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to  refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being  sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site  and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as  intended. </p>
<p><strong>What  information do you collect when I register for something?</strong></p>
<p>Visionary Strategies offers access to some services that are free but that require registration.  We may use your registration contact information to send notification of Visionary Strategies  products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We may also use your IP  address internally and share it with third parties for reporting and  statistical purposes.</p>
<p><strong>What other information do you request?</strong></p>
<p>We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the purposes of  conducting a survey or to provide additional services (for example,  subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement lists or information about  conferences and trade shows). Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we  will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the information is  requested.</p>
<p>We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Visionary Strategies products and services.  Except as stated above, Visionary Strategies will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed  to receive. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you  may receive mailings from other third party companies.</p>
<p>When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address,  and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>
<p><strong>What information do you collect when I purchase something?</strong></p>
<p>If you are purchasing something from Visionary Strategies, we need to know your name, e-mail  address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows  us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.  This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products and  services. Credit card information will not be shared or sold to third parties  for any purpose without your express permission.</p>
<p>Wherever Visionary Strategies collects personal information we make an effort to include a link  to this Privacy Policy on that page. </p>
<p><strong>Who do we share our information with?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Companies That Help Deliver Visionary Strategies Products or Services</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services (including processing your transaction, vendor direct shipping, credit  card authorization and fraud prevention).&nbsp; In those instances, we need to share your  information with these companies. Sometimes we also work with other companies  who assist us in gathering your information in order to enable us and the other  businesses of Visionary Strategies to provide you products and services. All of these companies are  only allowed to use your information for delivery of the product or service.</p>
<p><strong>Companies  Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</strong></p>
<p>On occasion, Visionary Strategies may share your information, unless  you elect not to have us do so, with other unrelated outside third parties selected by us, so that these third  parties can directly market their products or services via e-mail and/or postal mail.</p>
<p><em><strong>Information Sharing Between  Affiliates</strong></em></p>
<p>Visionary Strategies reserves the right to share your personally identifiable information,  including your email, postal address, phone number and purchase history, with  its Affiliates. Visionary Strategies may share your personally identifiable information with  Affiliates in order to conduct promotions, offer special premiums, and share  databases and equipment. We will not share your credit card information with  anyone, including Affiliates, without your express permission. We reserve the  right to share your information with other companies that become Affiliates.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party  Advertisers </strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve clicked on a third-party advertisement and  have left our Web site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. You must read the  privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be  handled on their site.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase  or Sale of  Businesses</strong></p>
<p>As Visionary Strategies continually strives to improve our business, from time to  time, Visionary Strategies may purchase a business or sell one or more of its businesses, and  personally identifiable information regarding you may be transferred as a part  of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; IF Visionary Strategies  purchases a business, the personally identifiable information received with  that business would be treated in accordance with the privacy policy of that  business on the date of sale. If Visionary Strategies and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired,  merged, liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we reserve the right  to transfer our user databases together with any personally identifiable  information contained therein, to a third-party.&nbsp; Visionary Strategies will make reasonable efforts to include  provisions in the selling contract to require the purchaser to treat your  personally identifiable information in the same manner you requested under this  Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Content  Partners</strong></p>
<p>On some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a third-party  partner Web site. In some instances the third-party sites will collect  information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their  content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information  collected is shared between Visionary Strategies and our third-party sponsors.&nbsp; These third parties will receive your  information because you will be visiting their Web sites or using their links  and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. You therefore  should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your  information and what kinds of choices you have.</p>
<p>On  some of our sites, Visionary Strategies may provide you with a link to the  supplier of that product so that you may get further information. If you link  to the supplier’s site, the supplier may collect or receive information about  you.</p>
<p>You  also may make a purchase from Visionary Strategies through a link from another Web site or  search engine and may use their express checkout tool to do so. When you do,  please be aware that both Visionary Strategies and that Web site or search engine will receive  your information.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory  Disclosures Required By Law </strong></p>
<p>Visionary Strategies will disclose personal information and/or an IP address,  when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary  to:</p>
<p>1) Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Visionary Strategies, </p>
<p>2) Protect and defend the rights or property of the Visionary Strategies Network of sites and  related properties, or visitors to the Visionary Strategies Network of sites and related properties,</p>
<p>3) Identify persons who may be violating the law, the Visionary Strategies Terms of Use  Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the Visionary Strategies Network  or its related properties,</p>
<p>4) Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. </p>
<p><strong>Your  Control Over Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out/Changing Your Status</strong></p>
<p>At any time, you can change choices you have previously made as to the use of  your personal information. Every communication Visionary Strategies sends you will contain a  clearly worded "Opt-Out" or "Unsubscribe" link allowing you  to withdraw your permission for future mailings. Alternatively, you can send a  blank e-mail to <a href="mailto:advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com">advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com</a> and type "Remove" in the subject field. This system is automated and  must be contacted from the email address you wish to have removed. Permission  changes will be honored as soon as possible after receipt. Please allow five to  seven days for processing. Permission changes will however not affect any  information which you provided to us and which we previously shared with our  Content Partners. </p>
<p><strong>Editing Your Profile</strong></p>
<p>If you are a registered member, you have the ability to review and correct your  personally identifiable information at any time. Simply sign into the site and  click the "My Profile" link on the header of every page. There, you  can change your address information, e-mail type, sign-in, and e-mail  permissions.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER  MATTERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>As of  January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to this  Site who are residents of California  to request information regarding Visionary Strategies’s disclosure of their information to third  parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an  e-mail to our customer privacy care center at <a href="mailto:advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com">advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Data  Security</strong><br>Visionary Strategies is  committed to doing its best to maintain the security of information collected  on our site. <br>While no  data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used  and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to put in place the  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect.&nbsp; When  you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we  use industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to  protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties.  Encryption is a process by which a message or information is scrambled while it  is in transit to our website SSL codes the information transferred between you  and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the  information. In addition to our online security efforts, we take steps to  protect your personal data offline, as well. All sensitive information and/or  systems that house that information (i.e., computers or filing cabinet) have physically  restricted access in our offices. Employees are granted access on a  need-to-know basis pursuant to specific job function requirements (for example,  a billing clerk or a customer service representative). Furthermore, ALL  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices through  periodic training sessions in an effort to keep security awareness levels high.</p>
<p><strong>Changes  to the Privacy Policy</strong><br>Visionary Strategies will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing  business circumstances and legal developments. If there are material changes to  this Policy or in how Visionary Strategies uses your personally identifiable information, Visionary Strategies  will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. Visionary Strategies  encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are  protecting your information. &nbsp;&nbsp;This Policy is current as of January 1, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Information About Children</strong><br>We are  committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online. We believe  that children should be able to use the Internet in a safe, productive, and  efficient manner and should be afforded the highest protection available with  respect to their personal information. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection  Act ("COPPA") took effect on April 21, 2000 and imposes certain  requirements on Web sites directed toward children under 13 that collect  information on those children, or on Web sites that know they are collecting  information on children under the age of 13. It currently is Visionary Strategies’s policy not to collect personal information on any person under 13. To learn more about  COPPA, consult the Federal Trade Commission’s COPPA Web Site <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a> or you may call 202/FTC-HELP.<br>By using this web site, you consent  to this Agreement and to the collection and use of information by Visionary Strategies as  specified above</p>
