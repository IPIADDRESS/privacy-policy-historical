							Policy. This Privacy Policy is intended to explain  our 

							privacy practices and inform you as to: </p>

						<ul class="Text_info">

						  <li>

								The kinds of personal information we collect from users 

								of the Site and how that  information is collected; </li>

							<li>How we use  your personal information; </li>

							<li>The  circumstances under which we disclose personal information to third parties; </li>

							<li>How you can  access, update or delete any personal information collected about you by us;  and </li>

							<li>The  mechanisms we have implemented to protect your personal information.</li>

						</ul>

						<p class="Text_info">We promise  that we will take steps to use your personal 

							information only in ways that are  compatible with this 

							Privacy Policy. The following policies are only to  

							transactions made and data gathered on web pages, newsletters, 

							discussion lists  and opt-in announcement lists owned and 

							operated by Visionary Strategies and does not apply to  any 

							other transactions, information, web site or Internet,

							Strategies and you or other consumers. &nbsp;As we continue 

							to develop our Site and take  advantage of technologies to 

							improve the services we offer, this may change. Such  

							revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. 

							&nbsp;We therefore encourage you to refer to this  policy on 

							an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy 

							policy. </p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							This Site is  offered and made available only to users 18 years 

							of age or older who reside in  the United States of America,  

							its territories and possessions ("U.S"). If you are 

							not yet 18 years  old, or do not reside in the U.S., please 

							discontinue using the Site  immediately, or if, for any reason, 

							you do not agree with this Privacy Policy,  please do not 

							participate in the features, activities and services that require  

							you to provide your personal information. This Privacy Policy 

							is a part of the  terms and conditions which are set forth in 

							our Terms of Use Agreement. Both  the Privacy Policy and Terms 

							of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users.  By using 

							this web site, you consent to this Agreement and to the collection 

							and  use of information by Visionary Strategies as specified below.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							<strong>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong>

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name 

							and a set of  numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet 

							Protocol" IP address.  When a visitor requests a page from 

							any Web site within the Visionary Strategies Network, our  Web 

							servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and 

							IP address.  The domain name and IP address reveal nothing 

							personal about you other than the  IP address from which you 

							have accessed our site. We use this information to  examine 

							our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the 

							Visionary Strategies Network,  its users, or to cooperate with 

							law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate  this 

							information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not 

							record e-mail  addresses of the visitors.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">


							<strong>What are cookies?</strong>

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">From time to time, Visionary Strategies or its advertisers may 

							send a "cookie" to your  computer. A cookie is a small 

							piece of data that is sent to your browser from a  Web server 

							and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read 

							data  off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other 

							Web sites. Cookies do  not damage your system. We use cookies 

							to identify which areas of Visionary Strategies's Network  of 

							Web sites you have visited or customized, so the next time you 

							visit, those  pages may be readily accessible. Our advertisers 

							may also use cookies to  ascertain how many times you've seen an 

							advertisement. Visionary Strategies and/or our  advertisers may 

							use this information to better personalize the content,  banners, 

							and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether 

							to accept  cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You 

							can reset your browser to  refuse all cookies, or allow your 

							browser to show you when a cookie is being  sent. If you choose 

							not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site  and 

							other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work 

							as  intended. </p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>What  information do you collect when I register for something?</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							Visionary Strategies offers access to some services that are 

							free but that require registration.  We may use your registration 

							contact information to send notification of Visionary Strategies  

							products and services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We may also 

							use your IP  address internally and share it with third parties 

							for reporting and  statistical purposes.  

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>What other information do you request?</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							We may also request your e-mail address or mailing address for the 

							purposes of  conducting a survey or to provide additional services 

							(for example,  subscriptions to e-mail newsletters, announcement 

							lists or information about  conferences and trade shows). Whenever 

							we request the identity of a visitor, we  will clearly indicate 

							the purpose of the inquiry before the information is  requested.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							We may from time to time send e-mail announcing new Visionary 

							Strategies products and services.  Except as stated above, Visionary 

							Strategies will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed  to 

							receive. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online 

							form, you  may receive mailings from other third party companies. 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your 

							name, address,  and e-mail address so we can administer the contest 

							and notify winners. 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							<strong>What information do you collect when I purchase something?</strong>

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							If you are purchasing something from Visionary Strategies, we need 

							to know your name, e-mail  address, mailing address, credit card 

							number and expiration date. This allows  us to process and fulfill 

							your order and to notify you of your order status.  This information 

							may also be used by us to notify you of related products and  

							services. Credit card information will not be shared or sold to 

							third parties  for any purpose without your express permission. 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							Wherever Visionary Strategies collects personal information we make 

							an effort to include a link  to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Who do we share our information with?</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Companies That Help Deliver Visionary Strategies Products or Services</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services 

							(including processing your transaction, vendor direct shipping, 

							credit  card authorization and fraud prevention).&nbsp; In those 

							instances, we need to share your  information with these companies. 

							Sometimes we also work with other companies  who assist us in 

							gathering your information in order to enable us and the other  

							businesses of Visionary Strategies to provide you products and 

							services. All of these companies are  only allowed to use your 

							information for delivery of the product or service. 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Companies  Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							On occasion, Visionary Strategies may share your information, unless  

							you elect not to have us do so, with other unrelated outside third 

							parties selected by us, so that these third  parties can directly 

							market their products or services via e-mail and/or postal mail.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><em><strong>Information Sharing Between  Affiliates</strong></em></p>

						<p class="Text_info">Visionary Strategies reserves the right to share your personally 

							identifiable information,  including your email, postal address, 

							phone number and purchase history, with  its Affiliates. Visionary 

							Strategies may share your personally identifiable information with  

							Affiliates in order to conduct promotions, offer special premiums, 

							and share  databases and equipment. We will not share your credit 

							card information with  anyone, including Affiliates, without your 

							express permission. We reserve the  right to share your information 

							with other companies that become Affiliates.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Third-Party  Advertisers </strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">Once you've clicked on a third-party advertisement and  have left 

							our Web site, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. You must read the  

							privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information 

							will be  handled on their site.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Purchase  or Sale of  Businesses</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							As Visionary Strategies continually strives to improve our business, 

							from time to  time, Visionary Strategies may purchase a business or 

							sell one or more of its businesses, and  personally identifiable 

							information regarding you may be transferred as a part  of the 

							purchase or sale.&nbsp; IF Visionary Strategies  purchases a 

							business, the personally identifiable information received with  

							that business would be treated in accordance with the privacy policy 

							of that  business on the date of sale. If Visionary Strategies 

							and/or its units or subsidiaries are ever sold, acquired,  merged, 

							liquidated, reorganized, or otherwise transferred, we reserve the 

							right  to transfer our user databases together with any personally 

							identifiable  information contained therein, to a third-party.&nbsp; 

							Visionary Strategies will make reasonable efforts to include  

							provisions in the selling contract to require the purchaser to treat 

							your  personally identifiable information in the same manner you 

							requested under this  Privacy Policy.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Content  Partners</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							On some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a 

							third-party  partner Web site. In some instances the third-party 

							sites will collect  information in order to facilitate the 

							transaction or to make the use of their  content more productive 

							and efficient. In these circumstances the information  collected 

							is shared between Visionary Strategies and our third-party 

							sponsors.&nbsp; These third parties will receive your  information 

							because you will be visiting their Web sites or using their links  

							and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. You 

							therefore  should refer to their privacy policies to understand how 

							they handle your  information and what kinds of choices you have.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							On  some of our sites, Visionary Strategies may provide you with a 

							link to the  supplier of that product so that you may get further 

							information. If you link  to the supplier's site, the supplier may 

							collect or receive information about  you.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">

							You  also may make a purchase from Visionary Strategies through a 

							link from another Web site or  search engine and may use their 

							express checkout tool to do so. When you do,  please be aware that 

							both Visionary Strategies and that Web site or search engine will 

							receive  your information.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Mandatory  Disclosures Required By Law </strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">Visionary Strategies will disclose personal information and/or 

							an IP address,  when required by law or in the good-faith belief 

							that such action is necessary  to: 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">1) Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process 

							served on Visionary Strategies, </p>

						<p class="Text_info">2) Protect and defend the rights or property of the Visionary 

							Strategies Network of sites and  related properties, or visitors 

							to the Visionary Strategies Network of sites and related properties, 

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">3) Identify persons who may be violating the law, the Visionary 

							Strategies Terms of Use  Agreement, the rights of third parties, or 

							otherwise misusing the Visionary Strategies Network  or its related 

							properties,

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info">4) Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities. </p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Your  Control Over Your Personal Information</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Opt-Out/Changing Your Status</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">At any time, you can change choices you have previously made as to 

							the use of  your personal information. Every communication Visionary 

							Strategies sends you will contain a  clearly worded "Opt-Out" 

							or "Unsubscribe" link allowing you  to withdraw your 

							permission for future mailings. Alternatively, you can send a  

							blank e-mail to 

							<a href="mailto:advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com">advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com</a> 

							and type "Remove" in the subject field. This system is 

							automated and  must be contacted from the email address you wish to have 

							removed. Permission  changes will be honored as soon as possible after 

							receipt. Please allow five to  seven days for processing. Permission 

							changes will however not affect any  information which you provided to 

							us and which we previously shared with our  Content Partners. </p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Editing Your Profile</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">If you are a registered member, you have the ability to review and 

							correct your  personally identifiable information at any time. Simply 

							sign into the site and  click the "My Profile" link on the 

							header of every page. There, you  can change your address information,

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>OTHER  MATTERS</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

						<p class="Text_info">As of  January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits 

							visitors to this  Site who are residents of California  to request 

							information regarding Visionary Strategies's disclosure of their 

							information to third  parties for direct marketing purposes. To make 

							such a request, please send an  e-mail to our customer privacy care 

							center at <a href="mailto:advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com">advertisingprofits@nmrdirect.com</a>.

						<p class="Text_info">

							<strong>Data  Security</strong><br>

							Visionary Strategies is  committed to doing its best to maintain the 

							security of information collected  on our site. <br>

							While no  data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from 

							intrusion, we have used  and will continue to use commercially reasonable 

							efforts to put in place the  appropriate physical, electronic, and 

							managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we 

							collect.&nbsp; When  you place orders for purchased products or access 

							your payment information, we  use industry standard SSL (Secure Socket 

							Layer) encryption technology to  protect the storage and transfer of 

							your data from unauthorized parties.  Encryption is a process by which 

							a message or information is scrambled while it  is in transit to our 

							website SSL codes the information transferred between you  and the 

							server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the  

							information. In addition to our online security efforts, we take steps 

							to  protect your personal data offline, as well. All sensitive information 

							and/or  systems that house that information (i.e., computers or filing 

							cabinet) have physically  restricted access in our offices. Employees are 

							granted access on a  need-to-know basis pursuant to specific job function 

							requirements (for example,  a billing clerk or a customer service 

							representative). Furthermore, ALL  employees are kept up-to-date on our 

							security and privacy practices through  periodic training sessions in an 

							effort to keep security awareness levels high.</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Changes  to the Privacy Policy</strong><br>

							Visionary Strategies will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in 

							response to changing  business circumstances and legal developments. If 

							there are material changes to  this Policy or in how Visionary Strategies 

							uses your personally identifiable information, Visionary Strategies  will 

							prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. Visionary 

							Strategies  encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be 

							informed of how we are  protecting your information. &nbsp;&nbsp;This 

							Policy is current as of January 1, 2010.

						</p>

						<p class="Text_info"><strong>Information About Children</strong><br>

							We are  committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online. 

							We believe  that children should be able to use the Internet in a safe, 

							productive, and  efficient manner and should be afforded the highest 

							protection available with  respect to their personal information. The 

							Children's Online Privacy Protection  Act ("COPPA") took effect 

							on April 21, 2000 and imposes certain  requirements on Web sites directed 

							toward children under 13 that collect  information on those children, or 

							on Web sites that know they are collecting  information on children under 

							the age of 13. It currently is Visionary Strategies's policy not to collect 

							personal information on any person under 13. To learn more about  COPPA, 

							consult the Federal Trade Commission’s COPPA Web Site 

							<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a> or you may call 202/FTC-HELP.<br>

							By using this web site, you consent  to this Agreement and to the collection 

							and use of information by Visionary Strategies as  specified above</p>
