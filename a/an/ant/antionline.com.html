AntiOnline.com Privacy Policy<br>
<br>
AntiOnline Partners, LLC. ("AntiOnline.com") has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the World Wide Web site located at www.AntiOnline.com (the "AntiOnline.com Site"). <br>
<br>
ANTIONLINE.COM GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
Our Web site sets cookies to administer our site, to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our Web site for you, and to save your password and member name so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit.<br>
<br>
Registration Form<br>
Membership on the AntiOnline.com Site is completely optional. AntiOnline.com's registration form requires users to give contact information (e.g., your name, address and e-mail address) and demographic information (e.g., your birthdate). On our join form, required fields are clearly seperated from optional fields. We use this information to send members information and announcements about AntiOnline.com (e.g., a weekly newsletter) and our partners.<br> 
<br>
During registration, you may be offered the opportunity to receive information from third parties or to register for third-party products or services. By choosing to accept such an opportunity, you consent to AntiOnline.com's disclosure of your contact and demographic information to that third party. Please remember that the use of your contact and demographic information by the applicable third party will be governed by that third party's own privacy policy.<br> 
<br>
Aggregate demographic information collected through the registration process is shared with advertisers and other partners. This aggregate information is not traceable to an individual user.<br> 
<br>
Online Surveys<br>
At times AntiOnline.com may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times AntiOnline.com may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. <br>
<br>
Contests<br>
At times AntiOnline.com may run contests on the Site where we ask for contact or demographic information. These contests are always optional. At times AntiOnline.com may share both the results of, and individual entries in, contests with the sponsors of the contests. Results of contests may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. <br>
<br>
Message Boards, Chat Rooms, Polls, and Community Tools<br>
AntiOnline.com provides many venues for member interaction and community, including message boards, chat rooms, online polls, and other tools. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms and message boards) may reveal a user's member name or e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information (e.g., Web page links) on the AntiOnline.com Site. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas of the AntiOnline.com Site, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not use these optional features on the AntiOnline.com Site. The aggregate result of polls may be shared on the AntiOnline.com Site. <br>
<br>
Member Feedback &amp; Questions<br>
AntiOnline.com stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the AntiOnline.com Site and associated services and at times may be shared with AntiOnline.com partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific identifying characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address or name) removed.  Feedback and questions may also be used as content in our weekly mailbag. <br>
<br>
IP Addresses/Clear GIFs <br>
AntiOnline.com may track individual IP addresses and use clear GIFs to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. Information gathered through our use of clear GIFs cannot be traced to an individual user and is used only for our internal purposes. <br>
<br>
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS<br>
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, AntiOnline.com may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties. <br>
<br>
AntiOnline.com believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should generally remain confidential. AntiOnline.com does not read or disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is available to all AntiOnline.com members, and in many cases other visitors to the AntiOnline.com site. Also keep in mind that AntiOnline.com is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat and instant message-like conversations pass through AntiOnline.com's servers, we generally do not store logs of these conversations. <br>
<br>
AntiOnline.com reserves the right to share some or all of your personal information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control with AntiOnline.com, in which case AntiOnline.com will require such entities to honor this privacy policy. If AntiOnline.com is acquired by another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by AntiOnline.com and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy policy regarding that information. <br>
<br>
OFF-SITE LINKS<br>
AntiOnline.com provides links to other sites. AntiOnline.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of these other sites. <br>

<br>
OPT-OUT<br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of most services that we offer to our members via preferences setting in the "Your Account" page. You may further opt out of certain information uses when providing information on individual forms. Please note that even if you have chosen to opt out of receiving communications from us, we reserve the right to contact you by e-mail about material changes to this privacy policy or the AntiOnline.com User Agreement. <br>
<br>

AD SERVER<br>
At times, AntiOnline.com uses reputable third parties to serve some of the advertisements you see on the pages of the AntiOnline.com Site. We may use clear GIFs, or pixel tags, provided by our ad serving company to help manage our advertising. These clear GIFs allow our ad serving company to recognize a browser's cookie when the browser visits the AntiOnline.com Site. This allows us to learn which banner ads bring users to our site. The information we collect and share through this technology is not linked to any information that would allow our ad server to personally identify our users.<br>
<br>
CHANGE POLICY<br>
From time to time we may revise this privacy notice. If we make a material change, we will post a notice on the AntiOnline.com Web site or notify you by e-mail, at which time you'll be able to "opt out" of these new practices by contacting us. <br>
