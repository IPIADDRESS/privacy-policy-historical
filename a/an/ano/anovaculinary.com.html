						<p>Anova collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us.  This may include when you request information from us, purchase or register a product, submit a rebate form, create an account with us, sign up for newsletters or our email list, use our Services, submit a rating or review, participate in a survey or promotion, or otherwise contact us.</p>

						<p>Information You Provide about a Third Party</p>
						<p>If you send someone else a communication from the Services, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication and will not be used for any other marketing purpose, unless such person registers with us or becomes a customer, we obtain consent from such person, or we explicitly say otherwise at the point of collection.</p>

						<p>Information You Provide Through Social Media</p>
						<p>You may also be given the option to link to your Facebook or other social media account through the Services. When you do, we may automatically receive certain information about you based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party services. This may include, but may not be limited to, name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, location, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity.</p>

						<p>Information We Automatically Collect</p>
						<p>
							We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Service or interact with our emails and online, mobile, and Connected Product advertisements, and to allow Anova to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information.  For example, we may automatically collect certain information from you, including but not limited to your browser type, device type, operating system, unique device identifier of any of your computer(s) or device(s) that are used to access the Services, software version, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, geolocation, phone model, phone operating system, and the domain name from which you accessed the Services.  We also may collect information about your use of the Services, including the date and time you access the Services, the areas or pages of the Services that you visit, the amount of time you spend using the Services, the number of times you return, whether you open, forward or click-through emails and ads and other Services usage data.
