                August 8, 2002</font><p><font face="Arial"><strong>Microsoft 
                Settles FTC Charges Alleging False Security and Privacy Promises</strong></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><em>Passport Single 
                Sign-In, Passport "Wallet," and Kids Passport Named in Complaint 
                Allegations </em></strong></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Microsoft Corporation has agreed 
                to settle Federal Trade Commission charges regarding the privacy 
                and security of personal information collected from consumers 
                through its "Passport" web services. As part of the settlement, 
                Microsoft will implement a comprehensive information security 
                program for Passport and similar services.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Good security is fundamental to 
                protecting consumer privacy," said Timothy J. Muris, Chairman of 
                the Federal Trade Commission. "Companies that promise to keep 
                personal information secure must follow reasonable and 
                appropriate measures to do so. It's not only good business, it's 
                the law. Even absent known security breaches, we will not wait 
                to act." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Microsoft, a provider of 
                software, services, and Internet technologies for personal and 
                business computing, operates three related Internet services: 
                Passport Single Sign-In (<em>Passport</em>); Passport Express 
                Purchase (<em>Passport Wallet</em>); and Kids Passport. <em>
                Passport</em> collects personal information from consumers and 
                allows them to sign in at any participating website with a 
                single name and password. <em>Passport Wallet</em> collects and 
                stores consumers' credit card numbers, and billing and shipping 
                addresses, and enables consumers to use the stored information 
                when making purchases at participating Web sites. <em>Kids 
                Passport</em> allows parents to create Passport accounts for 
                their children that can limit the collection of personal 
                information by participating Web sites. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Microsoft's <em>Passport</em> 
                privacy policies included statements such as, "Passport achieves 
                a high level of Web Security by using technologies and systems 
                designed to prevent unauthorized access to your personal 
                information" and "Your Passport is protected by powerful online 
                security and a strict privacy policy." The <em>Kids Passport</em> 
                privacy policy included statements such as, "Microsoft Kids 
                Passport allows parents to consent to the collection, use and 
                sharing of their children's information with Passport 
                participating sites. . . . You can choose to allow Passport to 
                share all of the information in your child's Passport profile 
                with a participating site or service, or you can limit the 
                information shared to just a unique identifier or age range. . 
                .."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Commission initiated its 
                investigation of the Passport services following a July 2001 
                complaint from a coalition of consumer groups led by the 
                Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the Commission's 
                complaint, Microsoft falsely represented that:</font></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It employs reasonable and 
                  appropriate measures under the circumstances to maintain and 
                  protect the privacy and confidentiality of consumers' personal 
                  information collected through its <em>Passport</em> and <em>
                  Passport Wallet</em> services, including credit card numbers 
                  and billing information stored in Passport Wallet;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Purchases made with Passport 
                  Wallet are generally safer or more secure than purchases made 
                  at the same site without Passport Wallet when, in fact, most 
                  consumers received identical security at those sites 
                  regardless of whether they used Passport Wallet to complete 
                  their transactions;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Passport did not collect any 
                  personally identifiable information other than that described 
                  in its privacy policy when, in fact, Passport collected and 
                  held, for a limited time, a personally identifiable sign-in 
                  history for each user; and<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Kids Passport program 
                  provided parents control over what information participating 
                  Web sites could collect from their children. </font></li>
                </ul>
                <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">The proposed consent order 
                prohibits any misrepresentation of information practices in 
                connection with Passport and other similar services. It also 
                requires Microsoft to implement and maintain a comprehensive 
                information security program. In addition, Microsoft must have 
                its security program certified as meeting or exceeding the 
                standards in the consent order by an independent professional 
                every two years.</font></font></p><font face="Arial">
                <p><font size="2">In addition to EPIC, the coalition of consumer 
                groups that filed the complaint regarding the Passport services 
                are: the Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media 
                Education, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, 
                Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Task 
                Force for Automative Issues, Electronic Frontier Foundation, 
                Junkbusters Corporation, Media Access Project, NetAction, 
                Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and U.S. PIRG. The Commission's 
                action today is also consistent with a recent decision by the 
                Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau 
                (CARU) regarding the Kids Passport service.</font></p>
                </font><p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">The Commission vote to accept the proposed 
                consent order and place a copy on the public record was 5-0. The 
                FTC is accepting public comment on the proposed order for 30 
                days, until September 9, 2002, after which the Commission will 
                determine whether to make it final. Comments should be sent to: 
                FTC, Office of the Secretary, 600 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.,
