<br>
The owners of AnimatedGif.net deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.<br>
<br>
No attempt is made to gather any specific information about our users. Our server logs automatically log the type of browser being used and from what IP our users are coming, but we have no idea who the actual users are. We do not use cookies.<br>

Our feedback forum allows users to leave their email address and real name. That information remains on the forum, and no effort is made to catalog that information for later use.<br>
<br>
Many people email us at AnimatedGif.net. While we keep all email we receive, we do not catalog the senders for future correspondence or solicitation.<br>
<br>
