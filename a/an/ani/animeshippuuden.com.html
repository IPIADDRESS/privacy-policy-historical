					<p>Anime Shippuuden Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Effective July 30th, 2008</p>
<p>Anime Shippuuden provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use the www.AnimeShippuuden.com site. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the site, and when you access, download, purchase, or use any information, site, products, or content appearing on the site or offered by Anime Shippuuden. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p>Information Collection: Personally Identifiable Information • In the course of using the Site, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, Paypal address, phone number, and home and business postal addresses. • Please be aware that when you register to become a Anime Shippuuden member, other users of the Site may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Sites or submit via the Site. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you. • As you use the Site, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a website or online service (“Log Data”). Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Sites and information you search for on a Site. When you launch the DivX Web Player on the Site our servers may automatically record Log Data. • Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Sites and aggregate usage of the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Site. • Third party advertisers on the Sites may also place or read cookies on your computer’s browser, which permit them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. The collection and use of such information is subject to such third party’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>How We Use Personal Information • Personal Information is used for the following purposes: (i) to provide and improve the Site, features and content, (ii) to administer your use of the Site and Anime Shippuuden account, (iii) to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Sites, (iv) to better understand your needs and interests, (v) to fulfill requests you may make, (vi) to personalize your experience, (vii) to provide service announcements, and (viii) to provide you with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on Anime Shippuuden. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. • We use information we obtain by technical means (such as the automatic recording performed by our servers or through the use of cookies) for the above purposes and in order to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for the technical administration of the Sites, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of the Site, to better tailor both to your needs, to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and website use behavior of our users, and to verify that visitors and users to and of the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>
<p>Information Sharing and Disclosure Anime Shippuuden Members. In addition to your username, any comments or submissions that you post to the site will be publicly available. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage Anime Shippuuden members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their comments or submissions.</p>
<p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Anime Shippuuden cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Anime Shippuuden or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate, or legally actionable.</p>
<p>Changing or Deleting Your Information All Anime Shippuuden members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the “user preferences” associated with their account. If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>Security Anime Shippuuden is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of industry-standard measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>International Transfer Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Anime Shippuuden, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p>Links to Other Sites The Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and site follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

Faced with the heavy responsibilities of stopping an impending world war and separation from his mentor Monk Gyatso, Aang fled from home on his flying bison Appa. Encountering a fierce storm, they crashed into the ocean, triggering Aang's Avatar State, which froze them in a state of suspended animation inside of an iceberg.They are awoken 100 years later by two siblings of Southern Water Tribe, Katara and Sokka.[24] Aang learns that the Fire Nation had indeed ravaged the world with a century of war, and that the Fire Nation's opening move in its campaign for global conquest was to launch a genocidal attack on the Air Nomads which drove Aang's entire race to extinction, thus making him &quot;the last Airbender&quot; left alive. He realizes that he must fulfill his destiny of becoming the Avatar and return balance to the world by defeating the Fire Nation. Along with Katara and Sokka, Aang sets out to master the four elements of Air, Water, Earth, and Fire (in that order). As he is already an Airbender, he first goes to the North Pole to find a Waterbending master.Aang soon discovers that Sozin's Comet, which Firelord Sozin used as a source of impetus by which to begin the war, will return in the coming summer, giving the Fire Nation enough power to ultimately accomplish victory. Aang must therefore master all the elements and end the war before then. For most of their journey to the North Pole, the group is pursued by Zuko, a banished Fire Nation prince and son of Fire Lord Ozai obsessed with capturing Aang to restore his lost honor.Having mastered Water, Aang travels to the Earth Kingdom to master Earthbending. There, the team meets Toph, a blind girl who is an Earthbending prodigy and becomes Aang's second teacher. The heroes go on to discover information about a solar eclipse which would leave the Fire Nation powerless and open to invasion; therefore they struggle to reach the Earth King with this vital information. Opposing them are enemies old and new: the conflicted Zuko, his sister Azula and her two friends Mai and Ty Lee. Azula engineers a coup from within that topples the Earth Kingdom and destroys any hope of a large-scale invasion of the Fire Nation.On the day of the eclipse, Aang, Sokka, Katara, Toph, and a small, determined group of allied warriors go ahead and launch a smaller invasion, which although brave ultimately fails thanks to Azula's cunning. Zuko finally learns the true side of himself and confronts his father. He later manages to gain the trust of the protagonists and becomes Aang's Firebending teacher.Sokka and Zuko then travel to a fire nation prison to rescue Sokka's father and Suki, a warrior who befriended the group when they traveled to Kyoshi Island. As Aang learns fire bending, the group originally decides to wait until after the comet arrives to go against the fire lord; however, when Zuko reveals his fathers terrible plan to use the power of the comet to rein fire onto the Earth Kingdom, the group knows they must defeat the Fire Lord soon. But Aang has trouble with the idea of taking away the Fire Lord's life.Sozin's Comet arrives and Fire Lord Ozai is on the brink of total victory in the war. Ozai declares himself king of the entire world and leads a massive fleet of Fire Nation airships on a genocidal campaign while leaving Azula behind to rule the Fire Nation under him. Having finally mastered all four elements, Aang and his friends face Fire Lord Ozai and his army. While his friends defeat the Fire Nation airships and liberate the Earth Kingdom, Aang confronts Ozai in a massive battle using all four elements. Meanwhile, Zuko returns to the Fire Nation with Katara and defeats Azula in a duel for the throne. Aang defeats Ozai but stays true to his principles and does not kill him, instead using a fifth bending technique, &quot;Energy-bending&quot;, to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers. Ozai and Azula are imprisoned. Zuko is crowned the new Fire Lord; with Aang at his side, he orders an end to the war. Aang has restored harmony to the world.

In the past, his criminal actions led to the death of 100 other samurai (including his sister's husband). He becomes immortal at the hand of a 800-year-old nun named Yaobikuni, and is compelled by the death of his sister to accept the quest that will end his agelessness. He has vowed to make amends by killing 1000 evil men, and until he does Manji will be kept alive by &quot;sacred bloodworms&quot; (血仙蟲, kessen-chū?), remarkable creatures that allow him to survive nearly any injury and reattach severed limbs even after hours of separation. They work by sacrificing themselves to seal the wound - they're worms that were bred to be as close in their chemical and physical make-up to humans as you can get without being human. They cannot handle regrowth on a large scale, but, for example, can reattach a severed limb or seal a hole in the brain.Manji crosses paths with a young girl named Asano Rin and promises to help her avenge her parents, who were killed by a cadre of master swordsmen led by Anotsu Kagehisa. Anotsu killed Rin's father and his entire dōjō, making them a family of outcasts. Anotsu's quest is to gather other outcasts and form an extremely powerful new dojo, the Ittō-ryū (a school teaching any technique that wins, no matter how exotic or underhanded), and has started taking over and destroying other dojos.In addition, another group calling itself the Mugai-ryū has emerged, in opposition to the Ittō-ryū. Its true leadership and motives are initially a mystery, but its methods (any tactics that leads to victory) resemble those of the Ittō-ryū. They try to enlist Manji's help as they seem to want the same thing. Eventually Manji joins but quickly pulls out after he finds out a member, Shira, is way too sadistic for his tastes. After a while Manji finally discovers that the Mugai-ryū work for the government. They are all death row inmates who are allowed to live only if they serve the shogunate . While Manji and Shira quickly grow to hate each other, after Shira runs off, Manji remains on friendly terms with the other members of the group.In a broader context, the series covers the effects of death and the consequences of not being able to die, as well as the meanings behind living.

As a result of the depletion of fossil fuels, humanity had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of massive arrays of solar power collectors orbiting the Earth, and supported by three orbital elevators, each one serving one of the three &quot;power blocs&quot; on the planet.[11]With this nearly inexhaustible source of energy benefiting only the major powers and their allies, constant warfare erupts around the globe among minor countries for fuels and energy. Countries that once economically relied on fossil fuels have plunged into poverty. Some even believe that solar energy threatened the &quot;promised land of God&quot;. This chaos led to the formation of a private military organization, called Celestial Being (ソレスタルビーイング, Soresutaru Biiingu?), dedicated to eradicating war and uniting humanity through the use of four humanoid machines called Gundams.[4][6] Mobile Suit Gundam 00 follows four mobile suit pilots termed Gundam Meisters ( ガンダムマイスター, Gandamu Maisutā?), sided with Celestial Being. The main protagonist is 16-year old Setsuna F Seiei (刹那・Ｆ・セイエイ, Setsuna F Seiei?), a quiet, taciturn young man who grew up in the war-torn Kurdish Republic. He pilots the GN-001 Gundam Exia, a high mobility mobile suit effective in melee combat.[12][13] Confronting the armed resistance of the three world superpowers, the Gundam Meisters were forced to fight several opposing aces, such as Ali Al-Saachez, a mercenary who was responsible for the deaths of the families of Setsuna and Lockon Stratos, a fellow Gundam Meister.Unable to counter Celestial Being's superior technology, the three major powers eventually unite into the United Nations Army (国連軍, United Nations Army?) in order to counter Celestial Being's armed interventions.[14] In order to fight the Gundams, the United Nations Army employed the help of Laguna Harvey. Harvey, a Celestial Being intelligence agent turned traitor, provides them with 30 GN-X, mobile suits equipped with pseudo-GN Drives that are almost on-par with the Gundams. As the United Nations resist Celestial Being's interventions, a second team of Gundams, known as Team Trinity, appears and assists in the Meisters' eradication of war, albeit in a much more cruel and cold-blooded fashion, in contrast with the original Meisters' less-aggressive nature of armed intervention.Alejandro Corner, a former Celestial Being observer who plans to make use of the chaos and destruction created by Celestial Being to rule a reconstructed world, subsequently takes over Veda, Celestial Being's supercomputer which is located on the moon. Without the organization's artificial intelligence, Celestial Being is easily overwhelmed and overpowered by the almost as powerful GN-X units and their superiority in quantity.The United Nations Army initiates Operation Fallen Angels to destroy the Gundams, having discovered the location of the Meisters' mothership, Ptolemaios. During the operation, Ali Al-Saachez kills Lockon Stratos after a climatic battle. Alejandro Corner, in his unique custom mobile armor Alvatore, attacks Gundam Exia as the GN-X units proceed to destroy the Ptolemaios and the remaining Gundams. Exia struggles with the monstrous Alvatore, but in the end succeeds in killing Alejandro. Graham Aker, an ace pilot of the United Nations Army, then challenges Setsuna to a fight, seeking revenge for his fallen comrades and questioning the purpose of Gundams' existence. The fight results in the destruction of both suits, with the fates of the pilots unknown.

Unknown to the general public, however, is A-Laws' misuse of power and inhumane tactics to oppress freedoms, doctrines, and ideologies in the name of 'unity'.Saji Crossroad has followed the path to becoming a space engineer, to keep his promise to Louise Halevy. But he ends up being mistaken for a member of the dissident organization, Katharon, and unjustly imprisoned. Louise herself is compelled to become involved in Federation government reform and joined A-Laws as a mobile suit pilot during the four-year gap.Meanwhile, Setsuna, having survived the battle with Graham Aker four years ago, has witnessed a change in the world due to the actions of Celestial Being. With the defeat of Alejandro Corner, he dreamed of a peaceful world without conflict; but before his own eyes was the reality of the continuing strain on peace, caused by the oppression of A-Laws. Setsuna tries to confront the A-Laws by himself with his battered Gundam Exia, but is easily overpowered by their newer models. He is rescued by Tieria Erde, piloting his new mobile suit, the Seravee Gundam. In the occasion, Saji discovers that Setsuna is a Gundam Meister and confronts him, just to be imprisoned at Celestial Being's ship.By combining the GN-Drives of Exia and 0 Gundam, Celestial Being's engineers manage to complete their newest mobile suit, the 00 Gundam, which was entrusted to Setsuna. To pilot the two remaining new units, Lockon Stratos' twin brother is invited to assume his position and pilot the Cherudim Gundam, and after Allelujah Haptism is rescued from the prison he was being detained in during the timeskip, he assumes the command of Arios Gundam.Meanwhile, to counter Celestial Being's reappearance, military personnel with experience in combat against the Gundams like pilot Soma Peries and commanding officer Kati Mannequin, are transfered to A-Laws. While both carry the determination to confront them once more, they disagree with the merciless tactics used by their new superiors.Oblivious to Celestial Being and the A-Laws, a third party is manipulating both sides of the conflict. This group call themselves &quot;Innovators&quot;, composed of Alejandro Corner's former assistant Ribbons Almark, and his five subordinates. Their contacts include Celestial Being's agent Wang Liu Mei and Setsuna's mortal enemy, the former KPSA cell leader, Ali Al-Saachez. Subsequently, the Innovators reveal that Aeolia Schenberg's plan has three phases; unite the world's factions through Celestial Being's armed interventions, unite the will of the world through the A-Laws, and then advance humanity into deep space

Their lives and fates are guided by strange jewels, called Magatama, that contain the spirits and destinies of warriors from the Three Kingdoms period of China, and also change colour according to the ranking of its bearer. The ultimate purpose of each of these high-school fighters, known as tōshi (&quot;fighter&quot;), is to become stronger than all others and ascend to become the eponymous Ikkitōsen — a relatively obscure yojijukugo which, literally translated, means &quot;one rider who is the match of a thousand&quot;. The destinies of those who wear the magatama, though, have repeatedly reincarnated time and time again for the past eighteen centuries — without fail — and the carnage is immense each time around.One girl, Hakufu Sonsaku, recently moved to Beijing and is apparently destined to unite the schools, just as her counterpart united seven countries long ago. It is hard to believe for the other characters just as much as the reader/viewer, as she consistently shows a lack of common sense and intelligence. However, the magatama that her mother Goei passes on (which belonged to Hakufu's late father Sonken; a play on the name of Sun Jian) is rumoured to be infused with the spirit of the legendary warrior Sun Ce.Hakufu herself knows naught of this, and explanations of what is going on are largely meant for those watching or reading. All she cares about is fighting whomever happens to be up for a rumble. In fact, fighting even excites her—especially scraps where she is heavily outnumbered. This causes incredible embarrassment and frustration to her cousin, a Toushi by the name of Shuyu Koukin with whom she is staying; he always ends up entangled in the situations in which Hakufu finds herself (to the point of being impaled once), and is driven to distraction by the conflicting facts that (a) the two of them are related, (b) she is incredibly attractive, and (c) her clothing inevitably ends up shredded.Just like all heroes, there are darker facets to Hakufu's ultimate destiny, and as always there is perpetual conflict in those around her to break the chains of their own seemingly predetermined fates, and to make their own lives. The other main characters include the honorable (Taishiji Shigi, Kanu Unchou, Kakouton Genjou), tragic (Ryofu Hosen, Chinkyu Koudai), manipulative and power-crazed (Toutaku Chuuei, Sousou Moutoku), enigmatic (Saji Genpou/Ouin Shishi, Chouun Shiryuu), perverted and unhinged (Kannei Kouha), and borderline schizophrenic (Ryomou Shimei—her fighting and non-fighting sides are poles apart)

	<li class="cat-item cat-item-132"><a href="http://www.animeshippuuden.com/category/tales-of-the-abyss/" title="based from a video game.
Tales of the Abyss takes place on Auldrant, a planet composed of elementary particles called Fonons (フォニム, Fonimu?, Fonim in the Japanese version). For much of Auldrant's history, only six fonons were known to exist, representing the elements of Shadow, Earth, Wind, Water, Fire and Light; but eventually a seventh fonon, controlling Sound, is discovered. Its discovery brings great chaos: using this newest Seventh Fonon allows one to read the future. One such Seventh Fonist, Yulia Jue, puts in place a future for the world for thousands of years to come, with the promise of unlimited prosperity at its end. This prophecy of the future's set path becomes known as the &quot;Score&quot; and is documented on &quot;Fonstones&quot; scattered throughout the world. The nations of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear and Malkuth have fought over the fragments of these tablets for generations, each uncovering them and hoping to discover the future before the other. Meanwhile, a holy order emerges dedicated to the reading of the Score and the keeping of the peace. This &quot;Order of Lorelei&quot; is headed by a Fon Master and maintains both religious/political and military branches. Finally, the Score and its promise of prosperity lead to a dangerous complacency within the general population of Auldrant; the slaughter of an entire people living on the island of Hod and the destruction of that landmass are countenanced because it was predicted in the Score.Luke Fon Fabre, the young son of Duke Fabre of the Kimlasca Kingdom is the Light of the Sacred Flame, the scion of Lorelei's power, destined to bring prosperity to Kimlasca. Since being kidnapped seven years ago by the Malkuth Empire, he has been kept confined to the Fabre family mansion. The shock of the kidnapping has erased all of Luke's memories prior to the event. One fateful day, a mysterious woman breaks into the mansion and sets off a chain of events that drag Luke into the center of a massive conflict between those who would do anything to see the Score carried out, and those who would see it broken forever.
