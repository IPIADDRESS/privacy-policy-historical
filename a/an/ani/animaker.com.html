The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where Animaker and a partner jointly promote the Services, Animaker may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing Animaker and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.  In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. Animaker may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names of Members). As explained in more detail below, Animaker may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.</p>
            <h3>Online Advertisements</h3><p class="profile_text">
