			<h3>Your Information</h3>

			<p class="answer">Like many websites, our Website may use 'cookies' from time to time. Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser. Cookies may also be used to record non-personal information such as the date, time or duration of your visit, or the pages accessed, for website administration, statistical and maintenance purposes. Any such information will be aggregated and not linked to particular individuals. The default settings of browsers like Internet Explorer always allow cookies, but users can easily erase cookies from their hard-drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note that some parts of the Website may not function fully for users that disallow cookies.</p>

			<p class="answer">Partners who help us serve advertising on and off the Website and analytics companies may also put cookies on your device. We use several third-party vendors to help deliver ads for relevant AnimeLab products and services to you when you visit certain pages on our Website and then visit certain third-party sites. We may share with third-party ad partners an anonymous, common account identifier (such as a unique ID), to help us measure and tailor ads and services provided to you.

				</p><ul>
					<li>Google Analytics</li>

			<p class="answer">
			AnimeLab uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the Applications or the Platforms (“Logged-In User). If you are a Logged-In User, AnimeLab may use your AnimeLab user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the Services you visit.

					<li>Google Display Advertising</li>
				</ul>
			<p></p>			
			<p class="answer">
			Additionally, AnimeLab uses Google Analytics code that allows for certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features. Subject to change, the Google Display Advertising features AnimeLab currently uses are Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">
			These features are used to advertise online; to allow third-party vendors, including Google, to show you advertising across the Internet; to allow AnimeLab and third-party vendors, including Google, to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Website and to report how ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Website. Data from Google's interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) is also combined with Google Analytics to better understand the needs of AnimeLab users and to improve the Services.
			</p>
			<p class="answer">
			You may opt out of such display advertising at any time by visiting your <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a> or by installing and running the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.

					Hey there, we see that you're running an ad-blocker and may be blocking ads on AnimeLab. By simply adding AnimeLab to your ad-blocker's whitelist you'll be ensuring that we can keep streaming free anime.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, why not get rid of ads forever by upgrading your account to Premium? You'll also get to watch dubbed shows, in HD and with no delays. It's a no brainer!
