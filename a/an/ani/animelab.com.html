					Hey there, we see that you're running an ad-blocker and may be blocking ads on AnimeLab. By simply adding AnimeLab to your ad-blocker's whitelist you'll be ensuring that we can keep streaming free anime.

					Alternatively, why not get rid of ads forever by upgrading your account to Premium? You'll also get to watch dubbed shows, in HD and with no delays. It's a no brainer!
