    <h2 class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><b>Privacy Policy</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Shareably Media, LLC (“<b>Shareably</b>” or “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>”) we have a few fundamental principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p3"><span class="s2">We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it (we can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason).</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s2">We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</span></li>
<li class="p3"><span class="s2">We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals and recognizes the need to protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to Shareably with respect to your access and use of Shareably’s website (www.shareably.net) (the “<b>Website</b>”). </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”), which sets forth, among other things, the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your rights with regard to the collected information. By accessing the Website, you are consenting to the collection and the use of your information by Shareably, but only to the extent described herein. Should you wish to revoke your consent, you may do so in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 below.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2">Shareably may make modifications, deletions and/or additions to this Privacy Policy (“<b>Changes</b>”) at any time. Changes will be effective: (i) thirty (30) days after notice of the Changes is provided through the Website or otherwise; or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Privacy Policy incorporating the Changes, whichever comes first. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">1. </span><span class="s1"><b>Protection of Your Information</b></span><span class="s2">.<b> </b>We are accountable for the information in our custody. Therefore, when we collect or use your information, we will utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its protection. It should be noted that no security procedure is currently 100% effective. Should any breach of your Personal Information occur, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible, as required by applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">2. </span><span class="s1"><b>Type and Purpose of Collection</b></span><span class="s2"><b>. </b>We collect information at various points in the Website to facilitate its use by our customers. Specifically, two types of information are collected:</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"><i>Non-Personal Information:</i> Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location data (which is anonymous) and the referring website (“<b>Non-Personal Information</b>”). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified. For example, we use “cookies”, which contains only certain statistical information. You can instruct your computer to inform you whenever a cookie is being sent, or you can disallow cookies through your web browser. If you do choose to disallow cookies, your experience on the Website may be diminished, or your ability to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">(b) <i>Identifying Personal Information</i>: To utilize some portions of the Website, you must first provide personal information that will allow you to be identified (“<b>Personal Information</b>”). This type of information will not be collected without your consent. The purposes of the collection of Personal Information are the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p11"><span class="s2">To create your account;</span></li>
<li class="p11"><span class="s2">To send you confirmation of your registration;</span></li>
<li class="p11"><span class="s2">To administer your account;</span></li>
<li class="p11"><span class="s2">To establish a relationship with you;</span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s2">To anticipate and resolve problems with your service; </span></li>
<li class="p6"><span class="s2">To understand your needs and desires vis-à-vis the Website;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">To update you on changes to our services or products, including new promotions.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">You may opt out of such notifications through your device or by contacting us at hi@shareably.net.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">We expressly acknowledge that we will not use your Personal Information for any other purposes without your consent. Further, we will only collect Personal Information to the extent necessary for the abovementioned purposes. The Personal Information we collect will vary depending on how you are using the Website, but may include, without limitation: (i) your name, mailing address, phone number and email address; (ii) credit card information and charge history; (iii) unique identifiers such as user name, account number and password; (iv) preferences information such as product or content interests, communication or marketing preferences; (v) device information and data; and (vi) Twitter and Facebook identity.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Additionally, Personal Information may be used and disclosed to the extent Shareably may deem reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of any agreement between you and Shareably, or to protect the rights, property or safety of any person or entity.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">3. </span><span class="s1"><b>Right to Examine Information.</b></span><span class="s2"><b> </b>You have the right to examine any of your Personal Information that we collect. Should you wish to examine such information, please send us a written request to hi@shareably.net<b>.</b> We reserve the right to charge you a reasonable administrative fee to access your information, as permitted by applicable law. In certain cases we may not be able to provide you with access to all of your Personal Information (ex: if the information also pertains to the Personal Information of another user).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">4. </span><span class="s1"><b>Withdrawal of Consent.</b></span><span class="s2"> You may withdraw your consent to the collection of Personal Information at any time by sending a written request to hi@shareably.net.<b> </b>Upon receiving notice that you have revoked your consent, we will stop using your Personal Information within a reasonable time, which will vary depending on what information we have collected and for what purpose. Please note that we will send you an email confirmation upon receipt of your request. Therefore, if you do not receive a confirmation email, please contact us again with your request. If you do choose to withdraw such consent, your experience on the Website may be diminished, or your ability to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">5. </span><span class="s1"><b>Sharing Information.</b></span><span class="s2"> We will not sell, rent or disclose to outside parties the information we collect, save and except that we may share the collected information with other parties as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">(a) <i>Affiliated Service Providers</i>: We have agreements with various affiliated service providers to facilitate the functioning of the Website, with whom we may share the information we have collected. For example, we may share your credit card information with the credit card service provider to process your purchase. All administrative service providers that we use are required to have the same level of privacy protection as we have, and therefore we expect that your information will be handled with the same level of care that we employ. Additionally, for example, we may use analytic or marketing services such as Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Taboola, or RevContent, to which collection you hereby unconditionally consent. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">(b) <i>Where required by law</i>: We may share the collected information where required by law, specifically in response to a demand from government authorities where such demand meets the legal requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">(c) <i>Statistical Analysis</i>: We may share Non-Personal Information and aggregated information with third parties, including but not limited to for advertising or marketing purposes. No Personal Information will be shared in this manner.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">(d) <i>Transactions: </i>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">6. </span><span class="s1"><b>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</b></span><span class="s2">. Shareably does not track its users across third party websites, nor does it allow third parties to collect Personal Information on our Website. As such, our service does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” requests. To learn more about browser tracking signals and Do Not Track please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.org/.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">7. </span><span class="s1"><b>External Links</b></span><span class="s2"><b>.</b> The Website contains links and references to other websites. We are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of information, or the privacy practices of such websites, and we expressly disclaim any liability relating thereto. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">8. </span><span class="s1"><b>International Transfer.</b></span><span class="s2"> Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your jurisdiction, where privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy represents your consent to any such transfer.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">9. </span><span class="s1"><b>Terms and Conditions of Use.</b></span><span class="s2"> This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and forms part of the Terms and Conditions of Use, which outlines the terms and conditions you agree to when accessing and using the Applications, and which can be found here: https://shareably.net/terms-of-use.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">10. </span><span class="s1"><b>Persons Under 18.</b></span><span class="s2"> The Website is not marketed toward persons under the age of 18. If Shareably discovers that it has inadvertently collected Personal Information about individuals under the age 18, it will promptly delete such information.
