This Privacy Policy outlines our current policy on personal information concerning club members, consumers, and franchisees, and covers the operations of our fitness clubs, franchise operations, business development, use of our web sites under anytimefitness.com (the "Sites") and mobile software applications ("Apps"). It gives you notice regarding:</p>

<li>Security procedures we use to protect your personal information from misuse</li>
<li>Retention of your personal information</li>
<li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Country-specific requirements</li>
</ol>

<p>We encourage you to read this whenever you visit our fitness clubs or Sites or use our Apps, since we may change this policy from time to time. A copy of the current policy is always posted at <a href="www.anytimefitness.com/privacy">www.anytimefitness.com/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>When you access the Sites, use our Apps, request or use products or services from us, whether directly or through our representatives, affiliates or franchisees, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You may refuse or withdraw your consent at any time; however, we may not then be able to provide you with our full range of products and services. You may not use the Sites, Apps, or our products or services if you do not agree to the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 class="text-purple">Territories</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers our activities in the United States, Australia and Canada. We may host the Sites on servers located within the United States, Canada, Australia or in any other country we, our service providers, or our service providers' vendors maintain facilities.  This means that your personal information may be stored on servers located within the United States, Canada, Australia, or in another country. The locations of our servers may change from time-to-time. Further, our franchisees may maintain individual websites in the country or territory they service.</p>

<p>Privacy requirements and treatment of personal information varies from country to country. To meet these requirements, we have included certain "Country-Specific Privacy Notices" as part of this Privacy Policy. You may locate the Country-Specific Privacy Notices at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 class="text-purple">Consent</h2>

<p>BY SUBMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND TO OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THIRD PARTIES TO US, YOU WARRANT AND REPRESENT YOU HAVE THEIR CONSENT TO PROVIDE THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US AND WILL HOLD US HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST CLAIMS BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS RELATING TO OUR PROCESSING AND USE OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>


<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">1. The information we collect, how we may use it and share it.</h3>

<h4 class="text-purple margin-bot">Anonymous Electronic Information</h4>

<p><em>Collection.</em> In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We do, however, collect your computer's or mobile device's IP address, which you necessarily disclose when you visit the Sites or download or use an App so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or device. The Sites or Apps may utilize "cookies" and similar technologies which are anonymous, unique identifiers that web pages may use to store data on your computer or mobile device or send data to our web server. Should you decide not to accept cookies from the Sites or Apps, you will limit the functionality we can provide you.</p>

<p><em>Use and Sharing.</em> We may use your IP address to, among other things: (1) help diagnose problems with the Sites or Apps, administer and improve the Sites or Apps, and measure the use of the Sites or Apps; (2) identify visitors' Internet providers, the type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the web sites from which a visitor found the Sites or Apps, the search terms and search engines used to find the Sites or Apps; and (3) gather other web analytics information relating to visitors' use and navigation of the Sites or Apps. This information does not identify you personally. On occasion we may aggregate this data with data from other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this aggregate information to vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, news agencies, or other parties to demonstrate the amount of interest in the Sites and Apps and to help us plan for technical infrastructure requirements. We may use cookie data to "recognize" you when you visit the Sites or Apps in the future, to troubleshoot how they operate, and for internal analysis of how people use the Sites or Apps. We do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information that you have on your computer.</p>

<h4 class="text-purple margin-bot">Participation in Activities</h4>

<p><em>Collection.</em> We receive and may store information you enter on the Sites, Apps or give to us in any other way, such as at a fitness club. For example, we collect information that you provide us when you join one of our fitness clubs, fill out a survey or a questionnaire, engage in social networking with us, register as a user of an App, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request information, fill out an employment or franchise application or otherwise contact us. If you choose to share any personal information with us, you will see that the amount and type of personal information required by us depends on the activity you are engaging in. For example, to join one of our fitness clubs, you may be required to provide contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>

<p><em>Use and Sharing.</em> We may use personal information you provide for particular activities related to our business, including, without limitation, membership processing; credit card or electronic payment processing; collections; club visit information; customer service; marketing and research; developing and displaying content and advertising tailored to your interests; processing your employment or franchise application; contests and sweepstakes; computer dashboards; responding to your request; send you text messages, push notifications, and notifications through the App and/or your mobile device; providing product, service, promotional and other information to you; and to contact you regarding administrative notices.</p>

<p>We may share personal information you provide with our parent company, subsidiaries, affiliates for our or their applicable business purposes. We may also share such information with our franchisees, vendors, or other business partners with whom we collaborate or work with to provide specific services to you or if we think the products or services they offer would be of interest to you. Our franchisees, vendors, or other business partners may use this information for marketing and solicitation purposes. Each of these parties' privacy policies will govern how they use your personal information. While we try to be selective in working with third parties, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information. Where payments are involved, we must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and associated banks to process your payment for purchases, returns or refunds.  We may transfer to Microsoft, its agents, and our other online service providers, personal information you provide to us so that these parties may store and process your personal information.</p>

<p>Your fitness club visit data (for all ANYTIME FITNESS clubs that you visit), App data, and personal information may be made available to those clubs' franchisees, management and employees, as well as to personal trainers or other contracted service providers whom you have engaged to provide services to you. Each of those parties is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, and is permitted to access and use your personal information solely for the purpose of providing or enhancing services you use through the ANYTIME FITNESS club system or App.</p>

<p>We may share aggregate information with vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, or other third parties. Aggregate information does not include personal information.</p>

<p>Except as described in this section, we will not give or sell your personal information to any other party for its use in marketing or solicitation.</p>

<h4 class="text-purple margin-bot">Additional Disclosures</h4>

<p>We may disclose personal information in any of the following circumstances: (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation; (2) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of its franchisees, suppliers, related entities, affiliates, business partners, or others; or (3) as we, in our sole discretion, believes is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization.</p>

<p>In addition, since our database is a business asset, in the event we are reorganized or sold to or merged with another company, we may sell, assign, or transfer your personal information to a purchaser of all or substantially all of our business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">2. Our relationship with other sites that can be accessed through this site</h3>

<p>The Sites may contain links to other web sites. Additionally, other web sites may contain links to the Sites. We do not review or monitor the web sites linked to the Sites and are not responsible for the contents or privacy policies related to any other web sites. If you visit one of these other web sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that web site. Where the Sites contains a link to another web site owned and/or operated by us, such web site use may be subject to different and additional terms of service and privacy policy terms and conditions.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">3. Access and correction of your personal information</h3>

<p>We strive to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the personal information in our databases and to keep that information up-to-date. We encourage you to promptly update your personal information if it changes. You may request a copy of the personal information we have about you.

We will respond to reasonable requests within the time limits established by applicable law or within a reasonable time if no time limit is established by applicable law. For your protection, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide the information you request and correct or delete any inaccurate personal information you discover. We reserve the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if: (1) the disclosure may be threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization; (2) the disclosure may lead to a violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (3) where you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to verify your identity.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">4. Security of your personal information</h3>

<p>We take what we believe to be reasonable precautions and have implemented managerial and technical procedures to try to protect the security of data and information, including personal information. However, we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or alteration or destruction of data or personal information. You provide your personal information to us at your own risk. You acknowledge that: (1) there are security and privacy limitations in computer systems and on the Internet which are beyond our control; (2) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Sites, including personal information, cannot be guaranteed; and (3) any such information and data, including personal information, may be viewed or tampered with by a third party while such information or data is being used, transmitted, processed, or stored.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">5. Retention of your personal information</h3>

<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented) or for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), or as permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">6. Changes to privacy policy</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy, completely or in part, from time to time through the posting of notices on the Sites, at any time and without notice to you, that this Privacy Policy has changed ("Notices"). You expressly waive any right to receive Notices. You should check the Sites frequently for Notices to identify modifications of the Privacy Policy that may be of interest to you. Any use of the Sites following the date on which we implement changes to this Privacy Policy or post a Notice constitutes your acceptance of all such changes.</p>

<h3 class="text-purple margin-bot">Can you access the personal information that we hold about you?</h3>

<p>Under the Privacy Act, you have a right to request access to and correction of your personal information that is collected and held by us.</p>

<p>If providing you with access requires a detailed retrieval of your personal information, a fee may be charged for the cost of retrieval and supply of information. This fee will not exceed the cost to us of retrieving and supplying the information and we will provide you with prior notice of the likely amount of the relevant fee.</p>
