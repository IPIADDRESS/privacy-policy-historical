<p>
In order to better provide you 
with numerous products and services, AnyPromo.com collects two types of information 
about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you 
with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. 
</p>
<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em></p>
<p>
This refers to information that 
lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when 
you register and set up an account, order a product or service, register for a Gift 
List, enter contests or sweepstakes, apply for the AnyPromo.com credit card, fill 
out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your 
name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit 
card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, AnyPromo.com 
can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services. For a few 
services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of other merchants 
and share it with them. For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you for your 
social security number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that 
information with the third-party telephone service provider that you have selected.
<em>If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, they will 
independently collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with 
their own privacy policies.</em> If you have questions about their information practices, 
please read their privacy policies. In many cases, you can find a link to their 
privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services. 
</p>
<p><em>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em></p>
<p>
This refers to information that 
does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information 
about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information 
is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, 
this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that 
you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your 
Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other 
resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or 
device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, 
such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route 
information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address 
is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing 
the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require 
IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
</p>
<p>
On an aggregated basis, we collect 
anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that 
is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. 
Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent. 
</p>

  <li><a name="wheredo">
  Where do we collect information 
  from you and how do we use it?</a>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Our primary goal in collecting 
personal information is to provide AnyPromo.com's visitors with a superior customized 
online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact 
purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, 
to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. 
</p>
<p>
Demographic data also may be collected 
at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis 
agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's 
server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the AnyPromo.com 
visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. AnyPromo.com 
also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based 
on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server 
log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. 
We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve 
our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve 
our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. 
We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis 
agents that tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content 
was served or viewed. </p>
<p>
We may also share your personally 
identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers 
and web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary

services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, 
shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment

require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.
</p>

List through our site, you will create an account, where we will collect and use 
your name, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, billing and

access to your Gift List will be able to see your name, e-mail address, city, state, 
and may have access to other personal information and product information that you 
have entered into the Gift List. If others place orders for items on your Gift List,

you. If you provide us with the e-mail addresses of your family and friends, we 
will use their e-mail addresses to send them your Gift List if you instruct us to.

<p>
Our warranty programs are administered 
and operated by third party warranty companies. When you purchase a warranty, from 
them we pass along your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, warranty

collected by them is not governed by this Policy. </p>
<p><em>Advertising</em></p>
<p>
We may display advertisements on 
our site. By knowing a little about you, AnyPromo.com will be able to deliver more 
relevant advertisements and content to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. 
For example, advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience 
they want to reach. AnyPromo.com takes the advertisement and includes it in
<span class="GramE">a AnyPromo.com e-mail to prior customers meeting that 
criterion. We may also have third-party advertising servers display ads linked to 
certain search terms that you have entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing. 
In this process, advertisers never have access to individual account information. 
AnyPromo.com may share aggregated data with advertisers. We may also use advertising 
partners to assist us in delivering personalized on-line ads to you through the 
use of cookies while you are on the Internet. </span></p>
<p><em>Web Site Use</em></p>
<p>
We also track customers' traffic 
patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, information and 
advertisements a customer views while using the site and what items they place in 
their basket or purchase. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers,

you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed 
in accordance with that merchant's policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply

further information that you disclose will be treated in accordance with this Policy.
</p>

Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: 
We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements 
and other information on our site and other sites or to serve promotional emails 
or personalized on-line ads. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie 
on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional emails and 
the company that serves personalized on-line ads, AnyPromo.com does not provide 
third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. AnyPromo.com 
and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, 
referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server

personal preferences and/or prior purchase history e.g., pens, mugs, T-Shirts), 
which are used to serve you the most relevant personalized on-line ad. The unique

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other 
Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif

view certain advertisements or other information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 
pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. 
Our ad server, content servers, affiliate program manager and website analysis agents 
may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular 
banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products 
are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, 
they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective 
on particular sites. Our ad server, content server, affiliate program manager and 
website analysis agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, 
and other pages, to keep anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on 
a banner ad or views other information on our site results in a purchase. They also 
collect the amount of the purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit 
number, quantity and identity of product purchased. 
</p>
<p>
E-mail Distributor's Use of Action 
Tags: Our third-party e-mail distributor may also use action tags. They may, for 
example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide AnyPromo.com 
with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with 
them web site usage information about visitors to our web site who have received 
a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. They use the information 
for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information 
used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor 
note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of action tags.
