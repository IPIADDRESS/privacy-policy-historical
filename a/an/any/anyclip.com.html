<p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Some of the information we and/or our third-party partners collect, as detailed above, may be collected as un-identified and non-identifiable information, which means it cannot be reasonably associated with you personally. Some of the information is collected in an aggregated form for analytical purposes. If any non-personal information is associated with you, we will treat it as personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>

<li>We may transfer information that we collect if we will be acquired by or merged with another company. If that should occur, user information is typically one of the assets that get transferred. Similarly, if AnyClip Ltd. or most of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information could be transferred or acquired. You should be aware that such events can occur, and you allow us to transfer your information in such event. If such event occurs, the buyer may continue to use your information.</li>

</ul>
<p>Entities we share your information with in order to provide you with the Services include: publishers, advertisers, ad agencies and storage services companies. This is required in order to provide our Services and provide you with compatible content and advertising.</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>Please note that if you withdraw your consent for our use or disclosure of your personal information, or ask us to delete or restrict how we use or process your personal information, subject to applicable law, we may not be able to provide you with all of our Services and customer support or the quality of the Services may be diminished.</p>
<ul>

<p>In the event you request us to delete your personal information, we, our affiliates or service providers may retain information for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes.

<ul>
<li>How long is the personal information needed to provide our Services? This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.</li>
<li>Does the personal contain any sensitive information?&nbsp;If so, a shortened retention time is generally appropriate.</li>
<li>Are we subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain your personal information?&nbsp;Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or personal information retained for the purposes of litigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.</p>
<p>You can request information on the data that might possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted.</p>
