            <p>Last Revision: November 1, 2015</p><p>
                AnytimeMailbox ("ATMB") values your online privacy. Please read the following policy
                ("Privacy Policy") to learn what information we collect from you ("You" or "User")
                when you access or use our website, www.anytimemailbox.com ("Site") and how we use
                that information. By accessing or using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that
                you have read, understood, accept and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy,
                and you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your
                information as set forth herein.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, or to the Terms of Use posted on the
                Site, you must not use this Site.
            </p>

            <p>
                ATMB may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised policy on
                the Site. Your continued use of the Site after the revisions have been posted will
                constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of the revised terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>1. Types of Information Collected. </strong>We collect two types of information
                from users
                of our Site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable
                Information.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> This is information that
                identifies you
                as a specific customer or user of the Site. In order to access certain parts of
                the Site, you will be required to register as a user. During the registration process
                you may be asked to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as
                your name, email address and password. For services such as online mail, we also
                request and store credit card or other payment account information, address and
                telephone information and physical copies of your identification papers. All information
                will be maintained in encrypted form on secure servers or in secure physical facilities,
                as appropriate. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information
                from you, such as personal interests, feedback, preferences, and recommendations,
                to help us customize the Site or our services and deliver personalized information
                to you. We may also supplement the Personally Identifiable Information that you
                provide with information we obtain from third parties; in that case, we will treat
                the information from third parties the same as information we collected ourselves,
                and, except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share that information
                with third parties.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>3. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>Sometimes referred
                to as "technical
                information," this is information about you that we collect by means of Internet
                technologies, such as "cookies" (small pieces of information transferred from our
                Site and stored on your computer when you visit our Site), in order to determine
                how users reached the Site to and track user usage patterns during their visits.
                We use the information collected from cookies to improve the function, content,
                appearance, and capability of the Site. In most instances, you can adjust your browser
                preferences to reject cookies, or to require you to accept each cookie; otherwise,
                most browsers are set by default to automatically accept cookies. Please be aware
                that some ATMB features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
                disabled. When you visit the publicly-accessible website, we collect the web page
                you came from, your browser's user agent string, any keywords you used in a search
                engine, your computer's IP address, the time and date, the name of the pages your
                computer visited, and how long it spent on each page. We may also track user traffic
                and pathways on the Site. This Non-Personally Identifiable Information may be combined
                with the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us for our own internal
                use. We may also log IP addresses for system administration purposes. This information
                is used to diagnose server problems, monitor traffic patterns, analyze trends, administer
                the Site, track user patterns, and identify the most popular areas of the Site.
                IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information and are only
                used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, except in cases
                where fraud is suspected, or otherwise at the request of law enforcement agencies.
                We may also use technical methods in HTML emails sent to our users, in order to
                determine whether users have opened those emails and/or clicked on the links in
                those emails, or many an inquiry in response to an email. These technical methods
                may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.
                We may also supplement this technical information with information we obtain from
                third parties, in which case we will treat the third party information as though
                it were information we collected ourselves. That information will not be shared
                with third parties except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>4. Uses of Information Collected. </strong>We use the information collected
                on the Site
                for a variety of purposes, including: providing the services and/or customer
                support
                you request, resolving disputes and troubleshooting problems, enforcing
                our agreements,
                doing research to protect and improve our services, and notifying you via
                email
                of surveys, new features, updates and promotional offers. We may also use
                certain
                data for administrative and analytical purposes such as Site management.
                We may
                also use Personally Identifiable Information to offer you other services,
                promotions,
                surveys or other opportunities from ATMB or affiliated companies.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>5. Sharing of Information Collected. </strong>We may share the information
                that we collect
                from and about you in a variety of ways, as follows:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Partners. We may share Personally Identifiable Information as well as Non-Personally
                    Identifiable Information (e.g., via cookies) with partners who choose to list their
                    goods, services or promotions on the Site, or with whom we affiliate in order to
                    provide you with certain services. The affiliated sites may have different privacy
                    practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Third Party Vendors. We employ third party vendors and service providers to
                    assist us in developing, hosting and maintaining our Site and databases, advertising,
                    sending and receiving email and other communications, and analyzing data. These
                    third parties may have access to Personally Identifiable Information as reasonably
                    necessary to perform these services, but they are not allowed to use that information
                    except for the purposes of providing these services for us.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>6. Compliance with Law. </strong>In connection with legal process, such
                as a court order,
                subpoena, official investigation or otherwise as required by law, we may be required
                to disclose certain Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. We may
                also report to law enforcement authorities any conduct we believe to be illegal,
                and may release Personally Identifiable Information to law enforcement authorities
                if we suspect it is related to unlawful conduct, or if necessary to protect our
                rights or property or to protect the safety of our employees or others. We may also
                release Personally Identifiable Information as part of a dispute resolution process.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>7. Aggregated Data. </strong>We may provide anonymous statistical information
                to suppliers,
                advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential business partners based
                on aggregated information drawn from Personally Identifiable Information provided
                by our users, in which case the information would no longer be Personally Identifiable.
                There are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on ATMB' ability to use such
                aggregated, non-personally identifying information, and ATMB may use such information
                or share it with third parties in any manner we choose.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>8. Change of Control. </strong>If ATMB is sold, merged, consolidated, reorganized,
                liquidated,
                or undergoes any other significant change of control, its accumulated customer information
                will be treated as a business asset. As with other business assets, this information
                will be subject to transfer to or acquisition by a third party. The acquiring party
                will then assume ATMB' rights and obligations with respect to you Personally Identifiable
                Information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>9. Security. </strong>ATMB employs a variety of security measures to protect
                your information,
                including encryption, passwords, physical security, etc. We restrict access to personal
                information to ATMB employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information
                in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound
                by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination
                and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. When you submit
                sensitive information to us, we protect the transfer of that information through
                industry standard encryption technology. However, no data transmissions over the
                Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure. It is always possible that, despite
                our best efforts to insure the safety and security of your personal information,
                third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you submit
                to us. You will be required to select a secure password when registering, in order
                to use all the features of the Site. Please be sure to choose your password with
                care. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your
                password to anyone. ATMB is not liable for loss of passwords due to user carelessness.
                If you believe your password has been compromised, please change it immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>10. Updates and Opt-Outs. </strong>ATMB processes personal information only
                for the purposes
                for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable
                service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage, and processing
                practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal information
                needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that
                the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend
                on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
                You can review the Personally Identifiable Information we have on record at any
                time, and correct or update that information or your privacy preferences by emailing
                us at "privacy at anytimemailbox dot com". You may also opt-out of future emails
                by following
                the link to the URL provided at the end of each email you receive and following
                the opt-out procedure specified there; please recognize, however, that it may take
                up to 60 days for that opt-out to become effective. We reserve the right to continue
                sending you certain emails related specifically to your account or to Site administration
                and service even after you have exercised your opt-out rights.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>11. Scope of this Privacy Policy. </strong>Except as otherwise provided
                in this Privacy
                Policy, the Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by us through
                the
                Site. It does not include the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Links. ATMB cannot control and is not responsible for the privacy practices
                    or content of websites that might be linked to our Site, or which show as links
                    on our Site. Please read the privacy statements of each linked site prior to submitting
                    Personally Identifiable Information to that site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User Forums and Comments. The Site may allow registered users to post information
                    on various forums, including message boards, blogs, bulletin boards, chat rooms
                    and other "public" spaces. By posting information to these spaces, you are choosing
                    to make such information public and it is therefore not covered by this Privacy
                    Policy. Please exercise care in the posting of any Personally Identifiable Information,
                    about yourself or others, in a public space.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Children's Privacy. The Site does not target and it is not intended to be used
                    by children under the age of 13 (or under the age of 18 without consent of a parent
                    or guardian). ATMB complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
                    We do not accept registrations or intentionally collect information from children
                    under the age of 13. If you believe that your child has submitted personal information
                    in violation of this Privacy Policy, COPPA, or the Terms of Use, please notify us
                    in writing at "privacy at anytimemailbox dot com" and we will immediately remove
                    such information.
                </li>
            </ul>



            <p>
                <strong>12. Additional Terms. </strong>Please refer to the Terms of Use posted on
                the Site to
                see additional terms and conditions that govern your use of the Site. By using
                the
                Site, you consent to be bound by those Terms of Use as well as this Privacy
                Policy.
            </p>



            <p>
                <strong>13. Contact Us.</strong> ATMB regularly reviews its compliance with this
                Privacy Policy.

                Policy or ATMB's handling of personal information by contacting us through this
                Site or at "privacy at anytimemailbox dot com". If we receive formal written complaints

                local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer
                of personal data that cannot be resolved between ATMB and an individual.
