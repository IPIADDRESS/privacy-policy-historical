  Policy</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use
 of the <strong>Success Ventures</strong> website: We respect your privacy. Below
 is an outline of what information this site gathers and how it's used:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whenever 
  your request a page, your IP address, browser and version, operating system 
  and the site you came from are stored in a log file. This information cannot 
  be used to identify a specific individual. This information is only used for 
  statistical purposes to help improve this site and provide accurate statistics 
  to help us understand site usage.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any 
  email addresses collected on this site are not sold, or disclosed to a third 
  party. The email addresses collected will only be used to send you information 
  from us.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><b><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cookies</font></b></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  common with many other online services, we will use "cookies" to store 
  and sometimes to track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of 
  data sent from the server which is stored on your PC's hard drive. You can ask 
  your browser to show you where the cookie has been set up and, if you wish, 
  you may also set your browser to refuse cookies. Some of the services which 
  we provide, however, depend on the presence of a cookie and, if you choose to 
  reject our cookie, certain online features may not be available to you. We use 
  the information collected in this way to help us review, develop and improve 
  the service which we offer to you.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Orders</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
  request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide 
  contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
  (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing 
  purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
  this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</font></p>


<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Log 
  Files</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
  use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic 
  information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
  information.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Sharing</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
  person.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
  use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These 
  companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information 
  for any secondary purposes.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Security</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users 
  submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected 
  both online and off-line.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
  our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such 
  as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted 
  and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While 
  on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web 
  browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
  locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive 
  information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
  off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
  mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
  to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
  representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Links</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we [Success Ventures] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 
  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the 
  privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable 
  information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected 
  by this Web site.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Correction/Updating 
  Personal Information</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
  a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your post code), 
  or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way 
  to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This 
  can be done by contacting our Admin Department.</font></p>


<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Notification 
  of Changes</b></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Home 
  page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
  it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide 
  to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
  at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users 
  will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
  manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
  which the information was collected.</font></p>
