<h2>Any.do Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="span16 columns">

<p>
This is the privacy policy (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) that governs how we, Any.do Inc.  ("Any.Do", "we", "our" or "us"), use Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with all of the services that we offer, whether via our website (the “Site”) or via Any.do's collection of mobile software application apps (collectively the "Service"). This Privacy Policy forms part of our end user license agreement (the “EULA”) found <a href="http://www.any.do/legal/app-license-agreement">here</a>.
</p>

<p>In keeping with our commitment to transparency, below you'll find our Privacy Policy in full. We
    ask you to read it thoroughly and contact us if you have any questions.</p>

<h3>In brief:</h3>
<p>Any.do is a collection of productivity applications that helps you organize your everyday life and get things done. We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other Service users, is important to us.</p>

<p>There are two types of information collected by us: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each, as defined below). This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices, the way we use the Personal and Non Personal Information we collect from our Service users and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Service.</p>

<p>"Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to: name, user name, password (and other login information), email address and contacts, Facebook® friends, home or other physical address, or other contact information. “Non-Personal Information” is information that does not indentify you as an individual, such as your browser type, IP address, the URL of the previous website you visited, the activity of a user of the Service, a user's 'click-stream' and scrolls on the Service, mobile device ID, date and time stamps of use of the Service and third party applications, email addresses in hashed form (i.e. a user’s email corresponds to a series of characters that does not permit the user’s identification) etc; although some opinions (such as the European Union) would consider IP address as Personal Information.</p>

<h3>Complete Privacy Policy:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><p>Consent.  By using the Service, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Service. </p></li>
    <li><p>Modification.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by sending you an in-App notification and/or by publishing the revised Privacy Policy on the Service.  Such change will be effective ten (10) days following the foregoing notification thereof, and your continued use of the Service thereafter means that you accept those changes.</p></li>
    <li><p>What Personal Information or Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.  We may receive and/or collect Personal Information or Non-Personal Information from you in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Account/'Login' Information.  We collect your login information in order to identify and authenticate your access to the Service. Such information may include full name, user name and access token.</p></li>
            <li><p>App Downloads.  We may offer you the opportunity to download, access and use certain third party apps (mobile software applications) from the Service. You acknowledge that your use of third party apps that you download via the Service is subject to the terms and conditions of the developer or provider of that app.</p></li>
            <li><p>Subscriptions, purchases or other transactions. When you use the Service to make a purchase or complete a transaction, you may be asked to share certain personal information in addition to what you have provided upon opening your account. Additionally, other information may be required to complete the transaction. This information will be requested on a case by case basis and will be saved only upon your express confirmation in order to enhance your experience using our Service.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mobile Device Data.  We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the Service.  Such information could be information deriving from your activation and use of location-based services on your mobile device. We may sample information regarding your location using the GPS in your mobile device (if activated by you) in order to allow us to provide you with the most relevant service provider in your vicinity for the accomplishment of your tasks. Other information could be your mobile device type and operating system version, mobile device ID, mobile advertising ids, IP addresses, and date and time stamps of use of the Service and third party applications. In addition, we may deploy certain Non-Personal Information (see Section 6 below) collection technologies within the Service in order to provide the Service and to help us gather aggregate statistics.</p></li>
            <li><p>Tracking Technologies. The Service may utilize “cookies” (small text files), log-files, web beacons and other tracking technologies to collect information about Service user activity and collect data. As a default, most browsers accept cookies, but you can change this setting under your browser's "Options" menu. Be aware that certain functions of the Service and other features may be affected if you disable cookies, i.e., they may not work correctly.</p></li>
            <li><p>Communications from users. So that we are able to answer your questions and requests as thoroughly as possible, we may keep emails or other communications you send to us.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>The Way We Use Personal Information.  The Personal Information will generally be stored locally on your mobile device itself. If you submit or we collect Personal Information through the Service, then such Personal Information may be used in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We will use your Personal Information to provide and improve our Service and to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Service that you are authorized to access.  By using your Personal Information, we can segment and create more accurate and customized experience that is suitable for your needs. We may also use your Personal Information to assist in the successful completion of a transaction, to analyze and provide feedback on the Service or to ensure a safe transaction free of credit or other fraud.</p></li>
            <li><p>We may transfer your Personal Information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.  Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</p></li>
            <li><p>We may share your Personal Information to third parties (with or without compensation) including potential and actual advertisers, sponsors, our third party service providers and partners. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third parties that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</p></li>
            <li><p>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our EULA, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Any.Do, our users, yourself or the public.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use of Non-Personal Information.  We may collect Non-Personal Information in order to provide and operate the Service, including for statistical and research purposes; to enable us to further develop, customize and improve the Service based on users’ common preferences and uses; to create and provide our business partners and affiliates with aggregated statistical data and other aggregated and/or inferred Non-Personal Information. We may also disclose Non-Personal Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners. We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-Personal Information was collected.</p></li>
    <li><p>Choice.  At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information.  If you choose not to provide mandatory Personal Information, you may still visit parts of the Service but you may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.</p></li>
    <li><p>Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products.  The Service may enable you to interact with or contain links to third party websites, mobile software applications, advertisements that are delivered directly to you from third party advertisers, and services that are not owned or controlled by us (each a “Third Party Service”).  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Third Party Services. Please be aware that the Third Party Services may collect Personal Information from you, and may download cookies to your device (computer or mobile phone). They may also use other technologies which personalize and measure the effectiveness of their ads. Cookies from third party advertisers are not covered under our Privacy Policy, nor do we control the practices of our partners.  Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you choose to use or interact with.</p></li>
    <li><p>Children's Privacy.  By using the Service you affirm that you are over thirteen (13) years of age.  If you are between the age of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18) years then, prior to using the Service, you must first review these terms of this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand its terms and conditions and agree to them.</p></li>
    <li><p>Security.  The security of Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@any.do">privacy@any.do</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Safe Harbor and International Transfers. The Service is hosted in the United States and is intended for United States visitors. Currently we store and process the information gathered on third party servers located in the United States. Some (although not all) of our third party hosting providers are certified under, or otherwise in compliance with, the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If you use the Service from the European Economic Area (EEA) or any other region with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, you acknowledge and agree that by using the Service you are transferring Personal Information outside of those jurisdictions to the United States.</p></li>
    <li><p>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.  In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information that we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how Personal Information is treated, transferred or used. In any of the circumstances described in this paragraph, the information will be subject to the privacy policy of the purchaser or assignee</p></li>
    <li><p>California Privacy Rights.  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:privacy@any.do">privacy@any.do</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.</p></li>
    <li><p>California Disclosures.  Our Service does not currently contain a web browser, and therefore there is no situation in which we are required to respond or take any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may allow third parties, such as Google Analytics, to collect personally identifiable information about an individual Service user’s  online activities over time and across different web sites when a Service user uses the Service.</p></li>
    <li><p>Access/Accuracy. To the extent that we collect and store Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. To access or change or delete your account information please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@any.do">privacy@any.do</a>. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete user's personal information. We provide the details for the procedures in the FAQs for these services.</p></li>
    <li><p>Commitment.  We are committed to protecting your privacy.  Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands.  If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or your Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at any time at: <a href="mailto:privacy@any.do">privacy@any.do</a>. </p></li>
