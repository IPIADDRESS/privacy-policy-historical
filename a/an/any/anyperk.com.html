At AnyPerk ("we" or "us" or "our"), safeguarding your privacy as a user of the AnyPerk website and/or any of the services we provide (collectively the "Service") whether as a paying member or just as a visitor (collectively, "User(s)") is important to us. Accordingly, we have created this privacy policy (the "Policy") to explain how we collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information ("Personal Information," as defined below) as it relates to your use of the Service.

Members who sign up for the free account are not required to enter a credit card.</p>
<p><u>Information Collected Automatically</u>: We may also receive or collect certain technical information when you use our Service, such as the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), mobile device ID, the date and time you access our Service, the Internet address of the website from which you divnked directly to our website, the operating system you are using, the Internet browser you are using, the sections of the website you visit, the website pages read, images viewed, and third party divnks, advertisements, and offers from our partners that you cdivck-on or other content that you may download from the Service.</p>
<p><u>E-mail</u>: When you e-mail us, we are collecting the information you include in your e-mail communication to us.</p>
<p><u>Cookies</u>: We use "cookies” to dedivver and to enhance the use of the Service. A “cookie” is a small amount of data that gets installed on the hard drive of a User's computer serving as an anonymous unique identifier and allowing the website to recognize future visits using that User’s computer. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous User, to offer personadivzed web page content and information for your use, and to otherwise facidivtate your experience in connection with our Service. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. However, you may choose to decdivne cookies if your browser permits, but please be aware that doing so may affect your use of the Service (such as logging in to your account) and your abidivty to access certain features of our Service or engage in transactions through our Service.</p>
<p><u>Web Beacons and Pixel Tags</u>: We may use “web beacons” or “pixel tags” to compile tracking information reports regarding Users’ demographics, traffic patterns on the Service, and offers that are redeemed through the Service. A “web beacon” or “pixel tag” is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on website pages to dedivver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our e-mails to tell us if an e-mail has been opened and acted upon. After compidivng these tracking information reports, we may then provide these reports to our vendors and other third parties. None of the tracking information in these reports can be connected to the identities of individual Users.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="span12">
<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content and the quality of our Service, and without your consent we will not otherwise sell, license or share your personal information to/with any other party(s) for commercial purposes, except: (a) to provide the Service, (b) when we have your permission, (c) or under the following instances:</p>
<p>Vendors</p>
<p>We may share aggregate data regarding the use of our Service by you and others with our third party vendors that provide discounts and offers through our Service. This information is intended to serve as a high-level overview of our Users' collective activities on our Service, and allows our vendors to modify their discounts and other offers based on such activity and user traffic. In some cases, we may provide periodic reports to our vendors pertaining to Users’ activities on our Service, page impressions, click-rates, and other similar metrics. Additionally, in some cases, we may share Personal Information about you with our vendors, such as your name and email address, for purposes of facilitating your purchase or redemption of certain perks or discounts offered through the Service.</p>
<p>Service Providers</p>
<p>We may use third-party service providers (i.e., for our web hosting, data management, network, hardware, software, storage, and/or payment processing needs) to manage one of more aspects of our business operations, including the processing or handling of Personal Information. When we do use an outside company, we use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure that Personal Information is used in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. By registering for the Service and providing your credit or debit card details to us, you permit us to use your provided credit or debit card information to bill you for the Service subscription you purchase. Additionally, by providing your credit card details to us, you consent to and authorize us to provide your credit card details to payment processors and financial institutions necessary to process your payment for the Service. To provide increased availability of our website and/or Service, some of these operations may potentially result in Personal Information collected by us being stored in other countries outside the U.S., and as a result, such Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable laws of such countries outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>Information Shared Amongst Our Affiliates, Subsidiaries and Divisions</p>
<p>We may share Personal Information gathered through our Service with and amongst our corporate subsidiaries, affiliates or divisions for internal business purposes in accordance with this Policy. We may also transfer Personal Information if AnyPerk is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy, and will ensure that such Personal Information continues to be used only in accordance with this Policy and your expressed choices.</p>
<p>Legal Disclosure and Compliance with Laws</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information as permitted or required by law without your consent, if we are compelled to release information by a court of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel production of such information (e.g., subpoenas). Additionally, if we have reasonable grounds to believe information could be useful in the investigation or prevention of improper or unlawful activity (i.e., suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service), we may disclose information voluntarily to law enforcement agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies without obtaining your consent before doing so.</p>
<p>AnyPerk uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run our services. Although AnyPerk owns the code, databases, and all rights to the AnyPerk applications, you retain all rights to your data.</p>
