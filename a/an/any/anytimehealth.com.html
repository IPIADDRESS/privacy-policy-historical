<h3 class="text-purple">1. Personal Information We Collect through the Site and Apps</h3>
<p>In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, except for our collection of “cookies” as described in Section 3.</p>
<p>We may collect personal information from you on our Site and App or through any other digital or personal communication with you. Information collected by us is voluntarily provided by you and may be integrated with other information you have provided to our franchisees upon signing up for a membership at an Anytime Fitness® club.</p>
<p>If you are an Anytime Fitness® member, you may choose to integrate information from your membership account with the Site and our App, but you will have the opportunity to opt-in to that integration of information across different platforms. Our Site and the App may also collect general information about your technology interface or preferences (such as the type of browser used or the files requested). Certain information described below is mandatory and if not entered, you will not be able to utilize or participate in our online services or features.</p>
<p>The information we may collect through your use of the Site may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
