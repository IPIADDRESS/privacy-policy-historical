<div class="txtBold">Clear GIFs</div>
<p>We may use "clear GIFs" (Web Beacons) to track the online usage patterns of our users in a anonymous manner, without personally identifying the user. We may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. We use this information to inter-alia deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our website to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our website to improve the website quality, functionality and interactivity and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>
<div class="txtBold">Third Party Tools</div>
<p>We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of our website. Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address. These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy.</p>
<p>Google Analytics specifically has been enabled to support display advertising towards helping us gain understanding of our users' Demographics and Interests. The reports are anonymous and cannot be associated with any individual personally identifiable information that you may have shared with us. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings options provided by Google. You can opt out from Google Analytics by visiting this link - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</p>
<div class="txtBold">Opting Out</div>
<p>From time to time, we may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements.</p>
<div class="txtBold">Advertising Networks</div>
<p>Our website can be used by advertising networks to serve ads to the users visiting our website. Third party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other sites on the Internet. </p>
<p>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting Ads Settings. For more information on how Google uses cookies in advertising and how you can opt out of the same, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/
</p><p>If a user opts out using the Ads Settings, the unique DoubleClick cookie ID on the user's browser is overwritten with the phrase "OPT_OUT". Because there is no longer a unique cookie ID, the opt-out cookie can't be associated with a particular browser.</p>
<p>When we present information to our advertisers - to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website - it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages / content within our website. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to third party websites / advertisers / ad-servers without your consent.</p>
