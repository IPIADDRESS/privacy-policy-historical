    <div class="t12">In order to request information via this web site, you must 
    first complete the form. We use the information you provide (such as name 
    and email address) solely to contact you about your request. Angelsoft LLC 
    is the sole owner of the information collected on  
    <a href="http://www.angelsoft.net">www.angelsoft.net.</a>  
    We value your trust and are committed to protecting your privacy.

    given the option to subscribe to periodic announcements and updates. We will 
    occasionally send you information on angel investing developments, 
    technology, products and other topics of interest. Out of respect for your 
    privacy, you have an option not to subscribe at the outset, and we provide 
    you a way to unsubscribe at any time. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out." </div>

    <div class="b14">Profile </div>
    <div class="t12">We store information that we collect through cookies, log 
    files and clear gifs, to create a "profile" of your preferences. We do not 
    tie your personally identifiable information and your site visit history to 
    information in the profile. We share do not share your profile with other 
    third parties. In order to provide better communications to you, we may on 
    occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with 
    information from third party sources such as industry databases and directories.</div>

  <div class="o15">Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>

    <div class="b14">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</div>
    <div class="t12">We may share aggregated demographic information about our 
    user base with future professional services sponsors. This information does 
    not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with 
    personally identifiable information.</div>

  <div class="b14">Legal Disclaimer</div>
    <div class="t12">We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable 
    information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary 
    to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, 
    or legal process served on our Web site</div>

  <div class="b14">Choice/Opt-out</div>
    <div class="t12">If you no longer wish to receive our announcements and updates, 
    you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in 
    each newsletter or communication, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:subscriptions@angelsoft.net">subscriptions@angelsoft.net</a>
    with "unsubscribe" in the subject line, or by clicking on <a href="http://www.angelsoft.net/unsubscribe">www.angelsoft.net/unsubscribe.</a></div>
    
  <div class="b14">Log Files</div>
    <div class="t12">As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information 
    automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet 
    protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), 
    referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. </div>
    <div class="t12">We use this information, which does not identify individual 
    users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users� movements 
    around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as 
    a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information</div>
    
    <div class="b14">Cookies</div>
    <div class="t12">A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user�s 
    computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We use both 
    session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when 
    you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an 
    extended period of time; it�s used to store things like passwords so you don�t 
    have to enter them more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following 
    directions provided in your Internet browser�s "help" file. If you reject cookies, 
    you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.</div>
    <div class="t12">Some of our business partners or linked sites may use cookies 
    on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy 
    statement covers the use of cookies by <a href="http://www.angelsoft.net">www.angelsoft.net</a>
    only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties linked to this site.</div>
    
    <div class="b14">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</div>
    <div class="t12">We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. 
    Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by 
    informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a 
    unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the 
    online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a 
    user�s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and 
    are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the 
    information gathered by clear gifs to our customers� personally identifiable information. </div>
    <div class="t12">We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know 
    which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the 
    effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing 
    campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out."</div>

    <div class="b14">Links to Other Sites</div>
    <div class="t12">This Web site contains links to other sites that are not 
    owned or controlled by Angelsoft LLC. Please be aware that we, Angelsoft, 
    are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
    you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
    each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This 
    privacy statement applies only to information collected by this web site.</div>

    <div class="b14">Access to Personally Identifiable Information</div>
    <div class="t12">If your personally identifiable information changes, or if 
    you no longer desire to receive information from us, you may correct, update, 
    delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or 
    by emailing us at <a href="mailto:subscriptions@angelsoft.net">subscriptions@angelsoft.net</a> 
    or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</div>

    <div class="b14">Security</div>
    <div class="t12">The security of your personal information is important to us. 
    When you enter sensitive information (such as private group information) on 
    our information request forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket 
    layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect 
    the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we 
    receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
    storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially 
    acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</div>
    <div class="t12">If you have any questions about security on our Web site, 
    you can send email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@angelsoft.net">webmaster@angelsoft.net</a>.</div>

    <div class="b14">Business Transitions</div>
    <div class="t12">In the event Angelsoft LLC goes through a business transition, 
    such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion 
    of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among 
    the assets transferred.  You will be notified via a prominent notice on our web 
    site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</div>

    <div class="b14">Changes in this Privacy Statement</div>
    <div class="t12">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
    changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem 
    appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use 
    it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</div>
    <div class="t12">We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at 
    any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to 
    this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</div>

    <div class="t12">If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our 
    privacy policy, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a></div>
