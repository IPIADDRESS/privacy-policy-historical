Who We Are and How to Contact Us
</h5>
<p>
<strong>
Who we are.
</strong>
Venture Hacks, Inc. (doing business as AngelList) is the Controller (for the purposes of the GDPR) of your Personal Data (referred to as either "AngelList", "we", "us" or "our" in this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy).  Our address is 90 Gold Street, San Francisco, CA 94133.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
How to contact us.
</strong>
If you have any questions about our practices or this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@angel.co">privacy@angel.co</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Our EU Representative.
</strong>
As we do not have an establishment in the European Union ("EU"), we have appointed a representative based in the United Kingdom, who you may address if you are located in the EU to raise any issues or queries you may have relating to our processing of your Personal Data and/or this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy more generally. Our EU representative is: AngelList Ltd located at 2nd Floor, White Bear Yard, Clerkenwell Road, London, UK, EC1R 5DF. Our EU representative can be contacted directly by emailing them at the following address:
<a href="mailto:euprivacy@angel.co">euprivacy@angel.co</a>.
</p>
<a name="your-rights-relating-to-your-personal-data"></a>
<h5>
Your Rights Relating To Your Personal Data
</h5>
<p>You have the right under this Privacy and Cookies Policy, and by law if you are within the EU, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
Request access to your Personal Data.
</strong>
If you are within the EU,
this enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Request correction of the Personal Data that we hold about you.
</strong>
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Request erasure of your Personal Data.
</strong>
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right if you are within the EU to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Object to processing of your Personal Data.
</strong>
This right exists where we are relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for our processing and there is something about your particular situation, which makes you want to object to processing of your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data.
</strong>
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of Personal Data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Request the transfer of your Personal Data.
</strong>
If you are within the EU, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
</li>
<li>
<strong>
Withdraw consent.
</strong>
This right only exists where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Data ("Consent Withdrawal"). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with access to the certain specific functionalities of our Site. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
How to exercise your rights.
</strong>
If you want to exercise any of the rights described above, please contact us using the contact details in Who We Are and How to Contact Us.
</p>
<p>
Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, except in relation to Consent Withdrawal, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
</p>
<p>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Complaints</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you would like to submit a complaint regarding this Privacy Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact us at: privacy@angel.co.
</p>
<p>
We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can.
</p>
<p>
If you feel that your complaint has not been adequately resolved, please note that if you are in the EU the GDPR gives you the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority, which for the UK, is the
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a>.
</p>

</li>
<li>

<strong>
Aggregated Data.
</strong>
We may also collect, use and share "Aggregated Data" such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your Personal Data, but once in aggregated form it will not constitute Personal Data for the purposes of the GDPR as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
No Special Categories of Personal Data.
</strong>
We do not collect any "Special Categories of Personal Data" about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.
</p>
<a name="how-we-use-your-personal-data-and-why"></a>
<h5>
How We Use Your Personal Data and Why
</h5>
<p>
We generally use Personal Data for the following: to deliver and improve our Services; to manage your account and provide you with customer support; to perform research and analysis about your use of the Services; to develop, display, and track Content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Services and other sites, including, potentially, providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites; website or mobile application analytics; to diagnose or fix technology problems; to automatically update the Services on your device; to verify your identify and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity; to enforce or exercise any rights in our
<a href="https://angel.co/terms">Terms of Service</a>;
</p>
<p>In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your Personal Data, the GDPR requires us to ensure that we have a legal basis for that use if you are within the EU.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your Personal Data only where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; or</li>
<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>
