<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not collect more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Website or App or enhance your gameplay experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Automatically as you navigate through the site: Usage Details, Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our Website, certain information is or can be automatically recorded. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with personal information, we treat it as such. Automatically collected information includes:</p>
<ul style="margin:0 0 0 30px;"><li>Statistical or technical information such as, for example, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, operating system and browser type, time and date, and how you navigate through and interact with the Website.</li>
<li>Information collected via “cookies” or “web beacons,” which are small data files that we transfer to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. We primarily use cookies for login session management. Anki cookies do not collect personal information from you, and we do not combine the information collected through cookies with other personal information you may provide to identify you. You can change the options on your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from a website. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionality of our Website.</li>
<li>When you use our Website we may collect “click stream data” (server address, domain name, etc.). This information can be combined with information you have provided to us, which will enable us to analyze and better customize your visits. We may use click stream data for traffic analysis or e-commerce analysis, to determine which features within our Website are most or least effective or useful to you.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Anki App is intended for general audiences. We do not use the Site to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13 without their parents’ consent.&nbsp; When a child under the age of 13 attempts to register to use the App, we will notify a parent and require consent for the child to become a user.&nbsp; At that time, we will provide a description of the information that the child may make publicly available, how we will use the information and other practices. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Please note that if you grant consent for your child to use the Anki App or Site, this may include such general audience communication services as email and your child will be able to communicate with, and disclose personal information to, other users of all ages. Parents can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by&nbsp;logging into their account and visiting their account profile page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
