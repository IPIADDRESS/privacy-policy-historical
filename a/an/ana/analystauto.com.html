      <p>We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site,   especially when conducting business. <br>
        This statement governs our privacy   policies with respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without <br>
        transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the   Site and make use of the various services offered by www.analystauto.com (collectively, "Services") ("Authorized Customers").<br>
        <br>
        <strong>"Personally   Identifiable Information"</strong> <br>
        refers to any information that identifies   or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such   information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone   number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number,   and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not   include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without   identification of the individual user) <br>
        or demographic information not   connected to an identified individual.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What Personally   Identifiable Information is collected? </strong><br>
        We may collect basic user   profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following   additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses,   phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size   of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the   Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What   organizations are collecting the information? </strong><br>
        In addition to our   direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as   credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) who may provide such services   as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our   Visitors and Authorized Customers. We do not control how these third parties use   such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal   information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of   these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the   distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the information given to   them.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable   Information?</strong><br>
        We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize   the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and   selling requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers   about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information   related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally   Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in   response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested   information.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>With whom may the information may be   shared?</strong><br>
        Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized   Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate   potential transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated   information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors and   Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. We   also offer the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving information or being   contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>How is   Personally Identifiable Information stored?</strong><br>
        Personally Identifiable   Information collected by www.analystauto.com is securely stored and is not   accessible to third parties or employees of www.analystauto.com except for use as   indicated above.

        <br>
        <strong>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</strong><br>
        Cookies are used   for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the   preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. We also use Cookies   for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an   Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is unused for more than 10   minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer   off.<br>
        <br>

        www.analystauto.com uses login information, including, but not   limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer   the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic   information.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What partners or service providers have access to   Personally Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on   the Site?</strong><br>
        www.analystauto.com has entered into and will continue to   enter into partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>
        Such   vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable Information on a need   to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers for service eligibility. <br>
        Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this   information. <br>
        Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply   with law. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to   comply with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement agency   to release information. We will also disclose Personally Identifiable   Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of our Visitors and   Authorized Customers. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>How does the Site keep Personally   Identifiable Information secure?</strong><br>
        All of our employees are familiar   with our security policy and practices. The Personally Identifiable Information   of our Visitors and Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number   of qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the   information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular basis.   Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers,   is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect information sent over   the Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a   secure site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors,   tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events   will not take place and we will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized   Customers for any such occurrences. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>How can Visitors correct any   inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
        Visitors and   Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable   Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@analystauto.com ">support@analystauto.com </a><br>

        We provide Visitors and   Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally   Identifiable Information from the Site's database by contacting <a href="mailto:support@analystauto.com ">support@analystauto.com </a>. However,   because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a   Visitor's entry without retaining some residual information. An individual who   requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this   information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use   Personally Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way   moving forward. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy   Changes?</strong><br>
        We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know   about changes to our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site.   However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause   disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized   Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such Visitor   or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized Customer to prevent   such disclosure. <br>
