    <div>
      <p>10.1. We use the service of the provider FaceApp (<a href="https://www.faceapp.com/" target="_blank">https://www.faceapp.com</a>&nbsp;privacy policy:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faceapp.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.faceapp.com/privacy</a>&nbsp;to process pictures uploaded by you to our Service and your Facebook profile pictures, if that is your preference. FaceApp analyzes the pictures and edits them based on the function of the game/quiz in question (e.g. prediction of how the person depicted would look if they were old).</p>
      <p>10.2. The processing of your personal data resulting from the picture is carried out by FaceApp for the sole purpose of the selected function. The original picture you provided us is only stored temporarily in FaceApp server and is then deleted within five days. Data other than the picture will not be transferred to FaceApp. The data is transmitted via an interface to FaceApp, so that FaceApp cannot collect your data any further (e. g. no IP address, cookies, etc.). Your picture will be shared with FaceApp only if you provide your explicit consent.</p>
      <p>10.3. The use of FaceApp functions is only permitted if you have reached the minimum age required for consent. The minimum age is generally 16 years, but it may be vary depending on the regulations of individual countries. In order to determine the legally permissible minimum age in the country from which you use our Service, we can use your IP address to determine your location.</p>

    <div>12. Using our service through facebook</div>
    <div>
      <p>12.1. If the Service is carried out as a Facebook application, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, your consent is required for us to access your stored data on Facebook.</p>
      <p>12.2. You are expressly referred in the context of the Facebook consent dialog to this data collection and the data shared by Facebook with us (e.g., public profile, friends list, e-mail address and "Like" information, among others only if these data elements are viewable by the public according to your Facebook privacy settings) through the Service.</p>
      <p>12.3. We may use the requested data anonymously for statistical purposes. I.e., if we may access the data on your Facebook chronic, posts or likes, we may evaluate how often a posting was shared or liked in order to help us improve our Services and its contents like our quizzes and personality tests. We perform the evaluation anonymously, meaning independently of your personally identifiable data we received on the basis of your consent (e.g. without the Facebook-ID). These evaluations are just for us only, without any transfers of this data to third parties.</p>
      <p>12.4. Our Service uses social plugins (“plugins”) provided by Facebook. The plugins are usually identifiable by a Facebook logo (e.g., letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon). For a full list of all social Plugins, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/doc/plugins/" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/doc/plugins/</a>&nbsp;.</p>
      <p>12.5. When you visit a page of our Service that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser that embeds the latter into the Service, enabling Facebook to receive information about you accessing the respective page of our Service. Thus, we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge: The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our Service. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmit your IP-address to Facebook.</p>
      <p>12.6. For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook’s privacy policy:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
