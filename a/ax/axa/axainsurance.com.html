            Your privacy is important to us and we promise we will respect your personal information.
            We will use your information to manage your insurance with us, including underwriting,
            claims handling, No Claims Discount entitlement and statistical analysis. This may include 
            disclosing your information within the AXA Group and to agents, suppliers, other insurers, 
            or reinsurers who provide services on our behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the AXA Group except:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where we have your permission; or</li>
            <li>Where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or</li>
            <li>To other companies who provide a service to us or you which includes proof of No Claims Discount (NCD) entitlement; or</li>
            <li>Where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may transfer your information to other countries including those located outside
            the European Economic Area. If we do this we will seek to ensure that anyone to
            whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection.

        <h2 id="#UsingYourOnlineAccount">Using your online account</h2>
        <p>
            When you set up your first policy with AXA, you need to set up an online account
            (My AXA Account). In My AXA Account, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View and print all your policy information and documents</li>
            <li>Securely make changes to your policy yourself whenever you want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To set up and use My AXA Account, you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address, which you give us when you buy your policy </li>
            <li>A memorable password which you can choose</li>
            <li>To answer an additional security question when you first set up your account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By using the same email address when buying additional AXA policies, your new documents
            will be stored to your existing online account. You can then view all your details
            in the same AXA Account. If you prefer your new policy to be saved in a different
            online account, you will need to use a different email address.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recommend that you do not share your account details with anyone. If you do give
            your email address and password to another person, they will have all your privileges,
            and will be able to view or change your cover or details. In these instances you
            will be responsible for their actions, and AXA cannot accept any responsibility
            for any adjustment made without your authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because circumstances can change, you should review your access details regularly
            to make sure they are still appropriate for you and anyone you have given permission
            to access your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            To set up a separate account for one or more of your existing policies, please
            contact our <a href="/contact/">help team</a>.</p>
        <p>
            If we’re contacted by phone we won’t discuss the policy with anybody other than
            the policyholder unless we already have their explicit consent. See <a href="#dealingWithOtherPeople">

        <p>
            To keep premiums low we participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent
            and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Approach the DVLA to check all or any relevant driving licence details of anyone
      named on the policy;
      </li>
      <li>Share information about you with other organisations and public bodies including
      the police;</li>
      <li>Share information about you and any other named drivers on the policy within the
      AXA Group and with other insurers;</li>
      <li>Pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry
      applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud
      and Theft Register, CUE, CIFAS and all DVLA databases) where those details will be checked and updated;</li>
      <li>Check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases
      including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy
      information and electoral role data). If false or inaccurate information is provided and
      fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud
      and money laundering;</li>
      <li>Periodically search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies to:
      <ul>
      <li>help make decisions about credit services for you and your financial associates</li>
      <li>help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your financial associates;</li>
      <li>trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies</li>
      <li>check your identity to prevent money laundering.</li>
      </ul></li>

            Motor Insurance Database ("MID"), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre
            ("MIIC"). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the
            Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland for the purpose of electronic vehicle
            licensing and by the police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's
            use of a vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and for preventing
            and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident, whether in the UK or abroad,
            other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain
            relevant policy information.

                help team</a> and inform us of whom you would like to speak on your behalf.
            However, this will exclude them from being able to cancel the policy as we require
            to speak to the policyholder regarding cancellations.

        <h2 id="automaticRenewals">Automatic renewals</h2>
        <p>
            Most AXA insurance customers benefit from the convenience of our automatic renewal
            service. Around 25 days before your renewal date we’ll email you your renewal invitation,
            which will also be stored in your AXA Account online for you to view or amend. If
            the cover’s right for you for another year, you don’t need to do anything. It’s
            the hassle-free way of keeping great value insurance with AXA. If you do not want
            to renew, just <a href="/contact/">call us</a> before your policy expiry date.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
            We securely retain your payment details and if you don’t contact us we will renew
            your policy automatically for you.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Does everyone qualify for this service?</h3>
        <p>
            Although most customers can benefit, not all policies can be automatically renewed
            - single trip travel insurance for instance. If you are unsure whether you qualify,
            you can <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
