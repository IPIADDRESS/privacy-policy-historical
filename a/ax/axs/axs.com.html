    <strong><a name="1"></a>I. Information we collect and how we use it</strong>
    <p>We may collect two types of information about you during your use of this Site, affiliated sites and applications: personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, contact information and financial information, as well as non-personally identifiable information, such as browsing patterns, geographic location and demographics which does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
    <p>A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
    <p>We may collect and use non-PII in order to improve the functionality of our site, better target products and services to you, and in the course of general maintenance and administration of the Site. Non-PII information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.</p>
    <p>Examples of Non-PII we collect include:</p>
            <h4>i. Cookies</h4>
            <p>As with many websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details of the cookies which we use and how to disable them should you wish.</p>
    <h4>ii. Web beacons</h4>
    <p>Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyse how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</p>
<br>
    <p>B. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</p>
    <p>The personally-identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate delivery of tickets and /or other products and/or services to our customers. In the process of providing these tickets, products and/or services, we require our customers to provide certain personally-identifiable information.</p>
    <p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and follow all applicable laws regarding its security. We collect and use PII in the following ways:-</p>
    <h4>i. Registration information</h4>
    <p>When you sign up for an AXS.com account (an “Account”) you will be asked to complete a registration form and to provide personally-identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password.   Registration information may include your name, physical address, email address, telephone number(s), and/or credit card information.  If you register with the Site, your information and information related to purchases you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us.</p>
    <p>Unless you opt out, we may use the PII we collect when you register for an Account to send you personalised marketing communications which may include, without limitation, event announcements, updates, reviews and special offers about us, our services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our Partners. If at any time you change your mind and prefer no longer to receive such marketing communications from us, you may “opt-out” in accordance with the "Opt-Out Policy" section below.</p>
    <h4>ii. Social networking information</h4>
    <p>We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalise your experience on the Site. This information may include your username or id, email address, interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Site. You may choose not to provide this information.</p>
    <h4>iii. Contact information for email newsletters, site emails and/or mobile Offers</h4>
    <p>With your consent, we may send you newsletters and/or other marketing communications to share information with you about the Site, about us or about our Partners and advertisers and sponsors. Subject to providing your consent and unless you opt out, you may receive a newsletter from us either by purchasing a ticket, registering for a particular newsletter, registering for an Account or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site.</p>
    <p>You may change your opt-in settings by following the instructions provided on the Site or in the designated area of the newsletters or emails or as specified in a mobile communication.  For more information refer to the Opt-Out policy section below.  Remember, if you consent to receive texts from us, your mobile network provider may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your mobile network provider for details.</p>
    <h4>iv. Entry information for contests or sweepstakes ("Offers")</h4>
    <p>We may operate Offers throughout the Site and other AEG Group properties, such as our Facebook page, which may require registration in order to enter.  The personally-identifiable information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, Customer's first name, last name, post code, phone number, age and email address. Where applicable and indicated to you, your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.</p>
    <p>Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personally-identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone number. Acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.</p>
    <p>If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature’s terms of use. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information should you enter such contest or sweepstake; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally-identifiable information for any other purpose without their consent. In those cases, where we are not the operator or sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
    <p>In the event that the Official Rules of an Offer conflict with this Privacy Policy, the Official Rules will govern that particular Offer.</p>
    <h4>v. Information collected for surveys or voting</h4>
    <p>From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and not request your personally identifiable information.  However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.   All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide the information you provide.</p>

Refer to the Information Security Practices section for more details on how we protect this sensitive information.</p>
    <p>We will use your PII including your financial information to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. We may also use your payment information to allow us to ship or deliver tickets and/or receipts to you, respond to customer service requests, review and enforce limits on the number of tickets purchased per event and to help prevent credit card fraud.</p>
    <p>In addition, unless you have opted out, we will use your contact details obtained during the transaction process in order to send you personalised marketing communications. </p>
    <p>If you'd prefer not to give us any personally identifiable information when you purchase tickets for events, then please visit the Box Office at the venue where an event is taking place.</p>
    <h4>vii. Information used for internal business purposes.</h4>

    <h4>ix. Information provided to customer support.</h4>
    <p>To facilitate our ability to provide you with timely and accurate customer support services, we may ask you for personally identifiable information, such as name, email address, and phone number so that we may be able to respond to your request quickly and identify your customer records in our database so as to identify and resolve your particular issue.
