      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to Axis Bank. This is why, as a member of Axis Bank, we are committed to the Axis Bank Privacy Promise for Consumers, which is as follows:</p>

<h4>Axis Bank Privacy Promise for Consumers </h4>

<p>While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our customers' trust. Keeping customer information secure, and using it only as our customers would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at Axis Bank. Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us. </li>
  <li>We will limit the collection and use of customer information   to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers,   which includes advising our customers about our products, services and   other opportunities, and to administer our business.</li>
  <li>We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in   the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that   information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject   to our normal disciplinary process.</li>
  <li>We will not reveal customer information to any external   organization unless we have previously informed the customer in   disclosures or agreements, have been authorized by the customer, or are   required by law.</li>
  <li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of   our customer information. We may, however, facilitate relevant offers   from reputable companies. These companies are not permitted to retain   any customer information unless the customer has specifically expressed   interest in their products or services.</li>
  <li>We will tell customers in plain language initially, and at   least once annually, how they may remove their names from marketing   lists. At any time, customers can contact us to remove their names from   such lists.</li>
  <li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support   services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and   to allow us to audit them for compliance.</li>
  <li>For purposes of credit reporting, verification and risk   management, we will exchange information about our customers with   reputable reference sources and clearinghouse services.</li>
  <li>We will not use or share - internally or externally -   personally identifiable medical information for any purpose other than   the underwriting or administration of a customer's policy, claim or   account, or as disclosed to the customer when the information is   collected, or to which the customer consents. </li>
  <li>We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date,   and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently   access their account information (except when we're prohibited by law)   and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continuously assess ourselves to ensure that customer privacy is respected. We will conduct our business in a manner that fulfills our Promise in the many nations in which we do business. </p>
