      <div class="heading">About Hyperlinks</div>
      <p>AxiCorp's Web sites may contain hyperlinks or "links" to other sites, and other sites may "link" to our sites. These Web sites that may be linking to or from AxiCorp's sites may have their own privacy policies. AxiCorp's privacy policy applies exclusively to AxiCorp and information collected by us. AxiCorp is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of the sites you link to, nor do we have control over the use or security of information provided by you or collected by those sites.

      <div class="heading">AxiCorp Security Technology</div>
      <p>AxiCorp uses GeoTrust Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect the information that you submit to us.

However, you acknowledge and accept that any services provided through the Website involve transmissions over the internet and that such transmissions are therefore subject to the internet’s inherent risks. Whilst we acknowledge our responsibility to take reasonable security precautions, you also acknowledge and accept that, as with any network, you may also be exposed to unauthorised programs transmitted by third parties, electronic trespassing and/or the failure of information and data to reach their intended destinations and/or erroneous receipt or misdirection of such information. Although our and our suppliers’ privacy and security features are designed to reduce these risks, we cannot guarantee that the risk can be eliminated completely. You therefore acknowledge that we will not be liable for any breach of confidence or unauthorised access and use arising as a result of such event.</p>
