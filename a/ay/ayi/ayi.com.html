We may combine that information with other information collected from the devices you use to access our Services, such as your mobile device model, and system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device and other demographics.</p>
<p>When you create a profile, create an account or use certain Services (such as searching for members) or otherwise engage with our Services, you may provide certain additional information such as username and password.

We may also collect information about the website you visited before you came to our Services and the website you visited after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied by your browser.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your Imported Profile from Social Networks</em></strong><strong>. </strong>When using our Services and applicable third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google +) (each and collectively, a “Social Network”), you may have the option to consent to connecting your profile or activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you choose to use our Social Network populating feature to create an account, we may import information for your account or profile on our Services from a Social Network. We only import from the information you allow to be imported from the Social Network access to which is controlled by your privacy settings on that Social Network (“Permitted Social Network Content”). The authentication of your Social Network login credentials is&nbsp;conducted solely by the Social Network. If you do use this feature we will initially create your profile by displaying your first name as the user name displayed to other users, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate). With your permission, we may also combine that information with your public social media profile (which may include your friend list, birthday, work history, interests, current city, photos, personal description and likes). By associating your Social Network account with our Services and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store Permitted Social Network Content across all our Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information You Post</em></strong><strong>. </strong>The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the Services or Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by Snap and other third parties.

<p><a name="opt-out"></a><br>
<b>V. CHOICE AND OPT OUT</b></p>
<p><strong><em>Changing Privacy Settings</em></strong>. To change your privacy settings or make other choices about the information received and shared with other members, go to Settings in the Service. Be aware that information that you disclose in posts while participating in the Services is publicly available and subject to redistribution by us and any third party. Snap is not responsible for the uses or copies of your profile or postings on or through Service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Administrative Messages</em></strong><strong>.</strong> You may not opt-out of administrative e-mails (for example e-mails about your transactions or policy changes) for your account.</p>
<p><strong><em>Opting Out of Cookies</em></strong>. You may be able to opt-out of cookies that may be set by our third party service providers. For information, please click <a href="#3pAnalytics">here</a>. Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements generally, and most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Services.</p>
<p>For data collection practices via cookies placed by third party advertisers on ads that appear on our Services (and for which we are not responsible), please click on the Adchoices icon in the ad, if available or go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>). Or to opt out of interest-based ads on mobile devices click on the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting on your iOS device or in “Settings” on your Android device click on “Opt out of Interest Based Ads.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Browser Do Not Track Signals</em></strong>. Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites and online services which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our users’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As such, we do not currently respond to these signals. Your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads.</p>
<p><strong><em>Opting Out of Promotional Messages.</em></strong> You may choose not to receive our promotional communications by logging into your account and clicking the “Preferences” tabs. You may also click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any e-mail or newsletter. You may also e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snap-interactive.com">privacy@snap-interactive.com</a>.

<p><b>VI. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES</b></p>
<p><strong><em>Permission to Contact You</em></strong>. When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving, in accordance with law.</p>
<p><strong><em>Links to Other Sites</em></strong><strong>.</strong> To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party sites or applications, you should be aware that these external or third party sites are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of those third party sites or applications to determine how your personal information will be utilized by the proprietors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Security</em></strong><strong>.</strong> We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control, including “Secure Socket Layers” or SSL to protect your data. SSL is encryption technology that helps safeguard your personally identifiable information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information, and your use of the Services indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Jurisdiction and Cross-Border Issues</em></strong>. We do not represent or warrant that our Services are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Services do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit access to our Services, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. By using our Services and submitting any personal information, you consent to the transfer of personal information to other countries, such as the United States, which may provide a level of data security different from your country of residence. You are also consenting to the application of United States law in all matters concerning the Services.</p>
<p><a name="changes"></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Children’s Privacy</em></strong><strong>.</strong> The Services are directed to a general audience and we restrict the use of our Services to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years of age and if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 18 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user’s personal information from our systems. If you become aware that anyone under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us in accordance with the “Contacting Us” in Section 7 below.</p>
<p><strong><em>No Rights of Third Parties</em></strong><strong>.</strong> This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Services.<br>
<a name="cali"></a><br>
<strong><em>Changes to the Privacy Policy</em></strong><strong>.</strong> We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on the Services. The most recent version of the Privacy Policy will always be posted on the Services, with the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy. You should check the Services frequently for updates. By accessing the Services after the Effective Date you are deemed to consent to our then-current privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your California Privacy Rights</em></strong><strong>.</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. To make such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@snap-interactive.com">privacy@snap-interactive.com</a>. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>

<p><strong>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong><strong>.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.</p>
<p><strong><em>HTML5</em></strong><strong>.</strong> We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iPhone or iPad. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile Device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Web Beacons/GIFS</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Embedded Scripts</em></strong><strong>.</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access Services from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><strong><em>e-tags/cache browsers/web logs</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our Services and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
<p><strong><em>Device Fingerprinting</em></strong><strong>.</strong> We may use device fingerprinting in some of our Services, which allows us to collect information about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. It can be used to prevent fraud or collect information about you.</p>
<p><strong><em>IDFA</em></strong><strong>.</strong> The IDFA is a device identifier that is used by many software kit developers for various reasons including to measure user behavior in mobile apps. Additionally, the IDFA is the shared identifier between an ad network and an ad server to report which networks delivered a particular download.
