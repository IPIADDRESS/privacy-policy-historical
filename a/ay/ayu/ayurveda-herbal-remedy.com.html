    <blockquote><font size="-1" face="arial">IndiaMART InterMESH Ltd.
      {hereinafter referred to as "IIL"} is committed to safeguarding
      its users' privacy. We request all our users to read the following
      'privacy policy' to understand how their personal &amp; business
      information will be treated, as they make full use of our services to
      their benefit. This policy is applicable only to the entire network of
      marketplaces operated by IIL and not by any other company. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Collection of Information </font></b><br>
       <br> IIL collects information from its users when they register to gain access
      to our services or at other specific instances when they are requested to
      provide us with their personal &amp; business information. During
      registration, we ask the users for their name, email address, business
      information and other personal details. Once a user registers, he/she is
      no longer anonymous to IndiaMART and it is deemed that the user has given
      IIL the right to publish the desired business &amp; personal details
      throughout its marketplaces, including but not limited to, business
      directory, trade leads, catalogs etc. <br><br>
       When you are on our network and are asked for personal information, you
      are sharing the information with IIL alone, unless it is specifically
      stated otherwise. Promotions that run on our network may be sponsored by
      companies other than IIL or may be co-sponsored by IIL and another
      company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with
      the sponsor. If the data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the
      time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in
      the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.<br>
       <br> We also gather usage statistics such as pages viewed, number of unique
      visitors, browser software, screen resolution etc. for analysis that helps
      us provide you improved user experience and services. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Use of Personal &amp; Business Information</font></b><br>
       <br> IndiaMART's primary goal in collecting personal or public information is
      to provide the user with a customized experience on our network of sites.
      This includes personalization services, interactive communications and
      many other types of services, most of which are completely free. Business
      information is used to display the user's business listing or product
      offerings across our network to fetch maximum business opportunities for
      the user. <br><br>
       In order to provide services free of charge, IIL displays advertisements
      based upon the site usage statistics and visitor trends. IIL uses user's
      perosnal &amp; business information to serve targeted advertisements
      through its websites, newsletters and customized mailers. In addition to
      it, once the user's personal and business information is displayed on our
      network, the user may start receiving business enquiries from various
      buyers and sellers, that might or might not be of their interest. IIL does
      not exercise any control over its users for sending business enquiries to
      the listed members. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Sharing of Information</font></b><br>
       <br> As a general rule, IIL will not disclose or share any of the user's
      personally identifiable information except when IIL has the user's
      permission or under special circumstances, such as when IIL believes in
      good faith that the law requires it or as permitted in terms of this
      policy.<br>
       <br> IIL may also disclose account information in special cases when IIL has
      reasons to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
      identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
      violating IIL's Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or
      interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) IIL's rights
      or property, other IIL network website users, or if IIL deems it necessary
      to maintain, service, and improve its products and services. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Distribution of Information</font></b><br>
       <br> IIL may, from time to time, send its users emails regarding its products
      and services. In addition, IIL may occasionally send direct mails about
      products and services of third parties that it feels may be of interest to
      the user. Only IIL or its agents working under confidentiality agreements
      will send these direct mailings. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Updation of Information</font></b><br>
       <br> A user may edit his/her account information and profile by logging onto
      our website and/or by sending a request to useradmin@indiamart.com. The
      requested changes may take upto 30 days to appear online because of
      verification process and server cache policies. <br><br>
       A user account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in
      the user not being able to access any members-only area of the network.
      Residual information will remain within our archive records. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Protection of information</font></b><br>
       <br> As with all information, IIL will never sell any user's personal or
      business information until and unless it is permitted by the user. Any
      user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners
      regarding product or service usage on IIL network is provided in an
      aggregate form only and does not include any personally identifiable
      information about any individual user. <br><br>
       We request our users to sign out of their IIL account and close their
      browser window when they have finished their work. This is to ensure that
      others cannot access their personal or business information and
      correspondence, if the user shares the computer with someone else or is
      using a computer in a public place. IIL takes necessary steps, within its
      limits of commercial viability and necessity, to ensure that the user's
      information is treated securely. <br><br>
       Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
      to be 100% secure. As a result, while IIL strives to protect the user's
      personal &amp; business information, it cannot ensure the security of any
      information transmitted to IIL and you do so at your own risk. Once IIL
      receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security
      in its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you post personal &amp;
      business information online, that is accessible to the public, you may
      receive unsolicited messages from other parties. <br><br>
      <b><font color="#004080">Changes in Privacy Policy</font></b><br>
       <br> The policy may change from time to time so please check periodically. <br> <br><br>
