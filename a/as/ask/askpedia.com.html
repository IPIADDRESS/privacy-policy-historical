	<div class="about_terms_b">

<p>
Askpedia realizes that privacy is an important issue for our users. This document outlines the type of 
information that Askpedia (“we,” “us,”, or “Askpedia”) collects when our users use our services, 
and the steps that we take to safeguard your information.
</p>

<div class="h2">Information Collected by Askpedia</div>

<p>
Askpedia collects various pieces of information on our servers in the United States when you use our 
services. Some of this information collection happens with your permission and some of it happens implicitly 
as you use our services.
</p>
 

<ul>
	<li>
		Your User Account and User Profile
		<p>
		When you create an account on Askpedia, we request personal information that includes your 
		username, password, and email address. You can also choose to provide additional information 
		to populate your user profile. This information includes your first and last name, user image, 
		self-introduction text, location, and your personal website URL.
		</p>
 	</li>
  
 	<li>
  		Your Interest and Knowledge Profiles
  		<p>
  		When you view, ask, and answer questions on our website, we will record the questions, answers, 
  		and tags to build your interest and knowledge profile. Asking a question or viewing an answered 
  		question will add the question tags as interest tags to your profile. Answering a question will 
  		add the question tags as knowledge tags to your profile.
  		</p>
	</li>
  
  	<li>
  		Your Askpedia Session Cookie
  		<p>
  		You must enable cookies in your web browser to utilize all of the services on Askpedia. When you 
  		visit our website, Askpedia stores a cookie in your web browser that uniquely identifies you to the 
  		Askpedia site. If you have not created an account on Askpedia, the cookie will identify you as 
  		an anonymous user. If you login using your username and password, the cookie will identify you as a 
  		specific Askpedia user on subsequent visits to the website.  You may choose to disable Askpedia’s cookies, 
  		but you will not be able to use several features of our service.
  		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Non-Personally Identifiable Information
  		<p>
  		When you use our website, we record and maintain a log of requests sent by your browser to our web 
  		servers. This information includes information such as the URL that was used to view our website, your 
  		PC’s Internet Protocol address, and the timestamp of the request. We also maintain a log of your 
  		actions such as asking/answering questions, viewing questions and user profiles, and conducting keyword 
  		searches.  We may use different types of technologies to collect this information, including cookies 
  		and single-pixel GIFs.
  		</p>
    
		<p>
		Advertisements of third-party advertisers may be displayed on Askpedia.  If you choose to click on an 
		advertisement or link, Askpedia may provide non-personally identifiable information to the advertiser and/or 
		web publisher.  Also, the advertiser or web publisher may use cookies or other technologies to collect 
		information when you are visiting their web sites.  The information advertisers or other third parties 
		collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not by Askpedia's privacy policy.
		</p>
	</li>
  
</ul>

<div class="h2" style="margin-top: 20px;">How we Store and Use your Information</div>

<ul>

	<li>
		Private User Account Information
		<p>
		We will not disclose your user account password, email address to other users, or to third parties for 
		promotional purposes. We transmit your account password using SSL encryption. We store your password 
		using one way encryption inside our database, which means that it is not visible to Askpedia employees.
		</p>
 		<p>
 		Askpedia uses your email address only for communications such as optional user activity alerts, 
 		resetting your password, and other service-related notices.  We may share your email address and other 
 		account information with third parties who provide Askpedia with administrative services.
 		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Public User Information
		<p>
		Your first name, last name, and location will be disclosed in your public user profile on our website, 
		as well as your user image, self-introduction text, and personal website URL, if you choose to provide them. 
		This information will be visible to the public, including registered Askpedia users and anonymous 
		users that visit our website without logging in. Both the questions you ask and the answers you post are 
		public information, and these are displayed along with your user name.
		</p>
	</li>
   
	<li>
		Interest and Knowledge Profiles
  		<p>
  		Your interest tags and knowledge tags will become part of an internal profile that will be used to generate 
  		question and user recommendations throughout the Askpedia website. This profile may also be used to provide 
  		other personalized Askpedia services. Your knowledge tags will be displayed in your public user profile, but 
  		your interest tags will be kept private and will not be displayed in your public user profile.
  		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		Non-Personally Identifiable Information
  		<p>
  		Askpedia may use non-personally identifiable information we collect to improve the quality of our 
  		services -  for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, by assessing and maintaining security, 
  		by increasing ad placements on web pages that are receiving more web traffic and presenting you with ads 
  		that we think you would be interested in seeing, or by allowing you to log in or access your profile information 
  		automatically.  We may also use the information to count and recognize returning users.  This information will not 
  		be made available to third parties for promotional purposes. We may periodically delete this information 
  		to minimize the history of your actions on our website.
  		</p>

		<p>
		Askpedia may conduct research on the non-personally identifiable information collected to determine user 
		demographics, interests, and behavior and may market the Askpedia service by sharing non-personally identifiable 
		information with potential advertisers or partners.  If it does so, Askpedia will share the non-personally identifiable 
		information in such a way that users are not identified.  For example, we may provide demographic or usage information
		to an advertiser so they may see how many registered users are from a specific geographic area or clicked on a 
		certain ad in the previous month.  Askpedia also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to contractors
		so that they can perform services for us.
		</p>
	</li>
  
	<li>
		Security
  		<p>
  		Askpedia makes significant efforts to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the collected 
  		information.  These measures may include the use of secure server technology.  Your payment information 
  		involving credit cards and PayPal are transmitted using SSL encryption. 
  		Be aware, however, that the Internet is not 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of any 
  		information transmitted over the Internet, and we accept no liability for any disclosure.
  		</p>
   
   		<p>
   		All private payment information regarding the transaction will be deleted upon the completion of your payment.
   		</p>
    
		<p>
		To increase the security of your information, do not share your passwords with anyone.
		</p>
	</li>
   
	<li>
		Information Sharing with Third Parties
		<p>
		Askpedia will not sell or rent any of your personal information  to third parties. We may collect aggregate 
		data on our user base, which may be shared with third parties. This information will only be disclosed in 
		aggregate form and will not uniquely identify you to third parties.
		</p>
    
		<p>
		Askpedia utilizes PayPal to process PayPal and credit card transactions. When processing PayPal transactions, 
		we re-direct you to the PayPal service which collects and processes your PayPal and credit card authentication information. 
		Askpedia does not retain any PayPal user information. Please see PayPal’s privacy policy for more information 
		on their privacy practices.
		</p>
	</li>
   
	<li>
		Other Sharing of Information
   		<p>
   		Askpedia may release information when necessary to comply with the law or a court order or an investigation.  
   		Askpedia also may release information to law enforcement to protect its rights, property, or other interests, including 
   		those of its customers or users or to prevent illegal activities or violations of 
   		Askpedia's <a href="http://www.askpedia.com/about/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
   		</p>
    
		<p>
		In the event that Askpedia, in whole or in part, establishes a partnership with another company, or is 
		acquired by or merged with another company, collected information may be transferred to the partner or the acquiring 
		or merging company.
		</p>
	</li>
   
	<li>
		Deletions/Corrections/Opt-Out
		<p>
		You can review and correct your information or delete your account and profile by contacting us 
		directly at <a href="mailto:support@askpedia.com">support@askpedia.com</a>.  You can change your profile 
		information by logging in to your profile.
		</p>
	</li>
  
	<li>
		Child Protection
		<p>
		Askpedia does not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13.  In compliance with the 
		Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we receive from people we believe to be children 
		under 13 will be purged from our database.
		</p>
	</li>
   
	<li>
		Links to Advertisers and Other Web Sites
   		<p>
   		Askpedia may contain links to other web sites, including advertisers.  In addition, user submissions may 
   		contain links to other web sites.  Askpedia is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
   		web publishers, advertisers, or other web sites that may be linked to the Askpedia site.
   		</p>
	</li>

</ul>
 
<div class="h2" style="margin-top: 10px;">Changes to Privacy Policy</div>

<p>
We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy. Please check the effective date to determine 
if the privacy policy has been modified since you last reviewed it.  Whenever we make significant changes, 
we will post advance notices on our website before we actually make the changes. If the changes result in 
less information privacy, we will send an email notification allowing users to opt out of the changes.
</p>
