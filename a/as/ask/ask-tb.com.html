<p>If you have installed a Search Application, we assign a unique identification code to your copy of the Search Application, and such code is written to your computer’s registry.</p>

You may prevent certain search activity from being associated with your account by signing out of your account and turning on Ask Eraser, and we will not store your search activity on Ask.com while Ask Eraser is turned on.

<p><b>Why we collect information:</b></p>
<p>(1) To respond to your queries with the best possible answers and search results<br>
(2) To understand our users (their demographics, what they do on our website, what site features they like, how they use them, etc.) and improve our Services, such as by personalizing content and advertisements to your interests; and we may aggregate query and click information for internal reporting purposes and optimization;<br>
(3) To administer our Services, process any payments and diagnose technical problems<br>

<p><b>Data collection and sharing involving third parties:</b></p>
<p>(1) Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our site and in our mobile applications. These companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect information, such as your computer’s IP address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our Services. They also may use web technologies such as cookies and pixel tags to collect data about you when you visit our site.<br>
(2) If you have installed a Search Application, then our Search Application partners may collect/receive information about you including the queries you submit via the Services, the Search Application functionality and/or website, the version of your Search Application or your browser settings, the search results and ads you click on and the address of the web pages you previously visited.<br>
(3) We use outside vendors for a variety of purposes, such as to send you emails and messages on behalf of other Ask community members, push notifications to your mobile device on our behalf, provide voice recognition services to process your spoken queries and questions, and help us analyze use of our services. Some of our products, services and databases are hosted by third party hosting services providers. We also may use vendors for other projects, such as conducting surveys or organizing sweepstakes for us, that involve collection of information from our users. We may also use authorized service providers to process services on our behalf, such as processing service or financial transactions that you have requested.&nbsp; We may share information about you with these vendors to enable them to perform their services.<br>
(4) We have contracts with all of these companies that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.<br>
(5) We will not share information we collected about you with any third party for other purposes (including direct marketing) without first obtaining your consent.<br>
(6) We may disclose data we collect about our users when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.<br>

<p>(1) You can turn on Ask Eraser and we will not store your search activity on Ask.com while Ask Eraser is turned on. AskEraser cannot be turned on from a mobile device and is not available for searches via Search Applications.<br>
(2) If you want to disable the cookies placed on your computer by advertising companies that display ads on our site to prevent them from using information about you for targeting purposes, you can use the opt-out feature at http://www.networkadvertising.org/.</p>
<p><b>Reviewing, changing or deleting information:</b></p>
<p>If you would like to review, change or delete information we have collected about you, please contact the Ask Privacy Officer <a href="mailto:privacyhelp@ask.com">here.</a></p>
<p><b>Security of the information we collect:</b></p>
<p>We have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to and misuse of the information we collect, including technological and physical security measures as well as procedural safeguards. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.</p>
<p><b>Cookies, pixel tags and mobile device IDs:</b></p>
<p>We use cookies, similar files and other technologies to collect and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device, Service usage, to track traffic flow and patters of travel in connection with our Services.&nbsp; If you install a Search Application, a unique cookie ID may be recorded for our uses, including internal reporting, optimization and to provide you with personalized content or advertisements and your search queries and interactions with our services may be associated with your unique cookie ID.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer. Our cookies enable us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings. Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you.</p>
<p>To understand more about cookies, click <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here.</a></p>
<p>If you are using an Ask mobile application, we use your mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.</p>
<p>A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’ computers.</p>
<p>Ask.com pixel tags are used to measure the popularity of our various pages and services. Advertising company pixel tags are used to measure the number of ad impressions and the performance of ads on our site, and to access the advertising company’s cookies placed on your computer. Data analytics company pixel tags are used to aggregate information about our advertising and your engagement with our site for market research, product improvement, revenue tracking and advertising optimization.</p>
<p>We use outside vendors to help us better understand our user demographics. They use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags in providing their services to us, but do not use them to target ads to you.</p>
<p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.&nbsp; We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you.&nbsp; We encourage you to read their privacy policies.<br>
<b><br>
Information from children under 13:</b></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we determine that a user is under 13, we will immediately delete all information pertaining to that user.</p>
<p><b>Government authorities and legal rights:</b></p>
<p>If requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any information we have about our users or modify other practices described in this policy, such as how long and in what form we keep information. We also may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
