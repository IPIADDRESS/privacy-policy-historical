<strong>Cookies Policy</strong> <br>
 Your use of our web site indicates your consent to the cookies described in this policy.
<br><br>
<strong>What are Cookies?</strong> <br>

A web cookie, a commonly used data collection technology, is simply a piece of text which can be placed on the browser of your personal computer or mobile device and subsequently read as you visit a web site. A cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular web site and then disappears when you close your browser, or it may be a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a period of time. Information from a cookie may be collected and used in aggregate form. Or data may be collected into an individual profile or record. That individual record may either be unique but anonymous, or the profile can be linked with information that identifies you as an individual. You can learn more about cookies, generally, at www.allaboutcookies.org

<br>
<strong>How do we use Cookies?</strong>
<br>We may use cookies for a number of purposes:<br>
.  We may use a limited number of cookies essential to particular services you have requested or for security purposes.

 . We allow third parties to set analytics, or performance, cookies to collect and report aggregate information.

We may use a persistent cookie to recognize you automatically each time you return, but only if you ask us to do so. We may also use cookies to populate in advance your login or forms you fill out on the site with information you have already provided. Finally, we may use certain demographic information to enable third party ad servers (see below) to show you ads based on information about you in your business capacity, for example, your title within a company or the size of that company. <br>
.Some of our sites may also allow third party ad servers to serve their own cookies to display advertising on our web sites. We do not determine, control or have access to their cookies.
