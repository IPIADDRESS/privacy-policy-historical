<p>Our Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy is designed to assist you in the understanding of how we collect, use and protect the personal information provided to us.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>When you visit our site, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and Use</p>
<p>information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and other users browse our site (“Passive Information”).</p>
<p><strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>This refers to information that lets us know specifically about you i.e. profile information.</p>

This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed on our website. You are assigned an identification number and select your own password – both are needed to enter the Site and to access your Contact Information. Please safeguard your password in a secure location as we are not responsible for breaches into the system when access is willingly provided.</p>
<p><strong>B. Ordering</strong></p>

<p><strong>D. Surveys and Promotions</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our products and services and to ensure that we’re providing accurate disclosures. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that coincide with your preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences, or let us know if you do not wish to receive any promotional materials, by adjusting your Subscriptions &amp; Email options on the Site.</p>
<p><strong>2. Aggregate Information</strong></p>
