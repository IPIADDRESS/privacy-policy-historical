<h1> Our Privacy Policy </h1>

In a nutshell...
We do not sell or share your information with anyone. We only collect information such as
your name and email address, so we can provide the services described on this website.
Your information is held in strict confidence.

<h2>Your Email Address is Safe</h2>

SPAM, (unsolicited junk e-mail) is the bane of the Internet, and I hate it as much
as you do.  In fact, I have been quite active over
the years educating readers about spam, where it comes from, and how to avoid it.
Because I respect your privacy, I pledge that I <b>will not rent, sell or otherwise reveal your e-mail address</b> to
any third party.  The only exception would be the acquisition or sale of this website.
<br> <br>
I further protect privacy and e-mail security in general by requiring that new
subscribers confirm their subscriptions. This prevents people from harassing
others by subscribing them to something they may not want.  When you submit an email
subscription request, you will receive an automatic message
asking you to confirm the subscription.  You <i>must</i> reply to this message before
your subscription will be activated.  And of course, you may always cancel your
subscription at any time.<p></p>

<h2>Editorial Mail</h2>

Email messages sent to this website are considered public statements
and become the property of the publisher.  Unless noted otherwise in
the message itself, such messages may be published in whole or in part.
Such publication may include your name and location, but per our e-mail
privacy policy will not include your e-mail address.

<h2>Security</h2>

This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of
the information under our control.  All information that we collect or store is accessible
only by the publisher, and technical staff at our online service providers.

<h2>Logs</h2>

This website runs on a standard unix web server that logs
visitor information such as the type of browser you are using, your IP
address, time, date, and pages viewed.  An IP address does not reveal the identify of a website visitor - it only
reveals the identify of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. We use IP addresses
to help diagnose possible problems encountered on our Web server.
Neither your email address nor any other personally identifiable information
is stored in the server log.

<h2>Use of Browser Cookies</h2>

Cookies have the potential to add useful functionality to a website,
and enhance the visitor's browsing experience in many ways.
This site, and perhaps the advertisers who make this free service possible, may use cookies to
get statistics on who sees what ads, whether you click on the ads, etc.

<h2>Third-Party Advertisers</h2>

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address,
or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more
information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information
used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here.</a>

The presence of third-party advertisements on this site should not be taken as an endorsement
of those products or services.
