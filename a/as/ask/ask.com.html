								<b>Privacy Philosophy</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Ask Jeeves Inc., producer of the Ask Jeeves and Ask Jeeves for Kids
								Web sites, believes that online privacy is crucial for the ongoing 
								success of the Internet as a service, commercial and entertainment 
								medium. We collect personal information from you primarily to make 
								using the Ask Jeeves services easier and more satisfying.  In 
								registering for certain services offered by Ask Jeeves you may be 
								asked to provide your name, e-mail address, zip code, gender and 
								information about what you do and don't like.  We request this 
								information from you so that we can provide you with the personalized 
								service necessary to meet Ask Jeeves' goal of humanizing the Internet.
								However, unless you designate otherwise, the personally identifiable 
								information you provide will be known only to you and to Ask Jeeves.  
								We will always ask you before providing this information to anyone 
								else.  If others want this information, including your name or your 
								email address, we will provide it only if you give us permission to 
								do so.
							</p>
							<p>
								From time to time, Ask Jeeves may introduce new products and services 
								to its users. To the extent these new products and services affect this 
								policy, this policy will be updated and you will be informed of these 
								updates and any privacy conditions related to these services.
							</p> 
							<p>
								<b><a name="infoTracked"></a>What information does Ask Jeeves gather/track and how is it used?</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either 
								anonymous or personally identifiable.  Anonymous information is 
								information that cannot be traced back to a specific individual.  
								For example, Ask Jeeves knows how many questions are asked each day 
								at each of its Web sites but does not know the names, 
								e-mail addresses or gender of the people asking the questions.
							</p>	
							<p>
								Personally identifiable information is information you provide that 
								lets us know specific facts about you so that we can customize the information 
								Ask Jeeves delivers to you accordingly. This information can include 
								your name, address, zip code, age, etc.  For example, when you 
								provide your home zip code when you register for Personal Jeeves, 
								Ask Jeeves is able to provide you with weather forecasts for your 
								hometown. It is our belief that you will find it beneficial 
								to provide us with personal information so that your experience with 
								Ask Jeeves is more satisfying.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information</b><br>
								Each time a visitor comes to an Ask Jeeves Web site, we collect some 
								information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, 
								including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted 
								advertising. At the Ask Jeeves Web sites, we collect the visitor's 
								domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com or 
								whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the 
								last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Ask Jeeves 
								Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser 
								on a Macintosh platform). 
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to collecting these types of information, Ask Jeeves 
								collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted 
								advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's 
								activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites 
								(e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within 
								the Ask Jeeves properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge 
								information about you into group data, which may then be shared on 
								an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but Ask Jeeves will not 
								disclose your individual identity or personal data without your 
								permission. When Ask Jeeves does present aggregated information to 
								outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</b>
								<br>
								Ask Jeeves requests that registrants for its Personal Jeeves 
								service provide personal information so that we can provide 
								personalized service.  As we have already stated, personally 
								identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless 
								Ask Jeeves has your permission to do so. In addition, Ask Jeeves 
								occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests, or other events that 
								require the collection, processing, and storage of individual 
								contact and demographic information to be used for the event. Ask 
								Jeeves sometimes co-sponsors these events with other companies, 
								in which case the user's individual contact and demographic 
								information is likely to be shared with participating sponsors. 
								A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will 
								not be released to third-party or non-participating organizations 
								without the user's consent, and Ask Jeeves will request that 
								co-sponsors of such events maintain the privacy of the registrants'
								information.
							</p>
							<p>
								When appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive 
								information from third-party organizations in connection with 
								services or events offered by Ask Jeeves. This option may be made 
								available through Ask Jeeves' registration and/or through 
								registration processes maintained by a participating third party. 
								In all cases, you will be informed before you register for the 
								event or service that a third party will be receiving the 
								registration information you provide and you will have the option 
								not to participate in any service or event that requires third 
								party involvement.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Use Of Ask Jeeves Cookies</b>
								<br>
								Ask Jeeves' Web sites use cookies to track traffic flow and 
								patterns of travel within and through the sites. Cookies are 
								a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and 
								retrieve login information on a user's system. Our Web server 
								automatically asks a new user whether his or her browser will 
								agree to accept an Ask Jeeves cookie file. If a visitor accepts, 
								our Web server will identify the user's cookie for Ask Jeeves' 
								use in internal reporting. If a user accepts an Ask Jeeves cookie, 
								but would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he 
								or she can just remove it from the browser.

								<b><a name="withWhom"></a>With whom does Ask Jeeves share the information it gathers/tracks?</b>

							<p>
								<b>Demographic Information</b>
								<br> 
								When we do present information to our advertisers, it is in the 
								form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to 
								survey questions and on-site behavior. Ask Jeeves will not 
								disclose the contact or demographic information of any individual 
								user to advertisers or any other outside organization without the 
								express permission of the individual. 
							</p>
							<p>
							<b>User Research</b>
								<br> 
								On occasion, Ask Jeeves will make available to potential advertisers
								and research firms aggregated results from research it has conducted 
								on its user base. Once again, Ask Jeeves will only provide such 
								demographic information on an aggregated basis and does not disclose 
								individual member profiles without user consent. 
							</p>
							<p>
                     <b>Special Policy With Regards to Information from Children Under Thirteen</b>
                        <br>
                        In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
								Act of 1998 (COPPA), Ask Jeeves will never knowingly request personally 
								identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
								parental consent.  When we do receive information (with parental 
								consent) from users under the age of 13, we will never voluntarily 
								share their personally identifiable information with third parties, 
								regardless of their stated preference given at registration.
