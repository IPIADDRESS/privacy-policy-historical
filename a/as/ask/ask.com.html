        currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means
        to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. However, our <a href="cookies">Cookie

    we may have collected from or about you.
</p>

<div id="7" class="PartialPrivacyPolicy-heading">7) RETENTION</div>
<p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as
    necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose
    of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period
    for personal information we process, we consider the amount, nature, and
    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your
    information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether
    we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting
    requirements.
</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may aggregate and de-identify your information in such a way that you may not reasonably
    be re-identified by us or any other company in which case we may use
    this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="#8">ACCESS, REVIEW, REVISION &amp; DELETION

        Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679)</a> (“<span class="underline">GDPR</span>”) natural persons

    personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a
    portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal
    information. You also have the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us.
</p>

<p>If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to
    honor that request, please please make your request <a href=" https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. To assist us
    in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.
    Unless you have voluntarily provided to us any other information about you,
    the only information we collect and store is linked to a unique user identification number we have assigned to

<p>Upon submitting your request to access or delete information we store about you, please provide your User ID
    number. This will enable us to process your request. </p>

<p>To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that verifies
    your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document;
    a utility bill or similar mailing will suffice. Please also obscure parts of the document such as identifying
    numbers so long as the document continues to clearly identify you.
    If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain photographs of you, please ensure that the
    identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making the

    your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will
    be reviewed by AMG’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to
    accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.
</p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we
    may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
    repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>

<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if
    your request is particularly complex or you have made a number
    of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
</p>

<p>We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about privacy. If,
    however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your
    complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your

    as "unsubscribe") or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or
    affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to
    exercise your disclosure choice options. If you are a California resident and request information about how to
    exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference
    on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Contact us <a href=" https://help.askmediagroup.com/hc/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, or you
