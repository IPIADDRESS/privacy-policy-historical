<div><strong>EU 2016/679 – GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR) COMPLIANCE</strong></div>
</div>
<p>We strive to fully comply with the new regulations set forth in the GDPR established by the EU. By accessing this Site and our products, you hereby acknowledge that we may process personal data (information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person), including but not limited to: names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, credit card details, financial information, posts on social media websites, and your and others’ IP addresses. To the extent any personal data we process is governed by the GDPR, it will be treated in compliance with the GDPR.</p>
<p>Specifically, any personal data we process is collected for a legal and lawful reason, including, but not limited to, providing you with a tailored experience to our website, exposure and access to and our and our affiliates’ products, and help you advance your own business. Further, we protect any personal data collected and limit nature and scope of data collected to that which is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is being processed (‘data minimization’). For example, if you purchase one of our products, we will process the personal data necessary to execute your purchase of the product and allow you to subsequently access and use the product. Such personal data may include your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, password, payment information (credit card number, bank account information), and/or IP address.</p>
<p>You have the absolute right to withdraw your consent, request erasure, and/or object to our processing of any of your personal data that we may process. Simply send an email to contact@askmethod.com with the subject line: “I hereby [withdraw my consent, and/or request reassure, and/or object] to my data being processed under the GDPR” and include in the body of your email your name. Upon receipt of your email we will cease processing your personal data. Should you desire to exercise your right to erasure or object to our processing of your personal data, please also include this request in the body of the email, and we will follow the procedures set forth in GDPR Art. 17, 18, and/or 21. Note, however, that notwithstanding your exercise of your right to withdraw, object and/or request erasure, we will not provide any refunds for products purchased beyond the deadline(s) established for the respective product(s) you purchased.</p>
<p>Upon request, pursuant to GDPR Art. 12 and 15, we agree to provide you with information regarding any of your personal data that we have processed, including the following:</p>
<ol>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the purposes of the processing;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the categories of personal data concerned;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organizations;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We take the protection of personal data seriously and not only strive to process and retain it in the safest manner possible but also, we have measures in place that detect and alert us to any data breaches that may occur, and will notify you in the unlikely event that any of your personal data is affected by any breach. Unless you have provided us explicit consent and/or you have volunteered without solicitation such personal data, we do not process any personal data that reveals your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
<p><strong>AUTORESPONDERS</strong></p>
<p>We may use autoresponders to communicate with you by e-mail. To protect your privacy, we use a verified opt-in system for such communications and you can always opt-out of such communications using the links contained in each autoresponder message. If you have difficulties opting out, you may contact us by sending an e-mail to contact&nbsp;[at] rlassociatesllc [dot] com, or sending us mail to the address listed below.</p>
<p><strong>OPTING-OUT</strong></p>
<p>We provide you the opportunity to opt-out from any promotional or marketing emails that we may send you. You may do so by following the instructions included in each communication or by emailing us at contact&nbsp;[at] rlassociatesllc [dot] com.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on order forms that are hosted by our third party service providers, the transmission of that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
<li>DoubleClick Platform integrations</li>
<li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our Site.&nbsp; Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our check-out form but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order.&nbsp; The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the right advertising message.</p>
<p>You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s ad settings and/or you may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>
<p>As advertisers on Facebook and through our Facebook page, we, (not Facebook) may collect content or information from a Facebook user and such information may be used in the same manner specified in this Privacy Policy. You consent to our collection of such information.</p>
<p>We abide by Facebook’s Data Use Restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any ad data collected, received or derived from our Facebook ad (“Facebook advertising data”) is only shared with someone acting on our behalf, such as our service provider. We are responsible for ensuring that our service providers protect any Facebook advertising data or any other information obtained from us, limit our use of all of that information, and keep it confidential and secure.</li>
<li>We do not use Facebook advertising data for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns, or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis (unless authorized by Facebook) and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our Facebook advertising campaigns.</li>
