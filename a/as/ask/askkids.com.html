              <p><b>Ask for Kids</b> is a U.S. site hosted in the United States. 
                Ask for Kids believes that maintaining the online privacy of children 
                is essential to building a safe site where kids can learn and 
                play. We provide the following privacy policy (the "Privacy 
                Policy") in conformance with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy 
                Protection Act ("COPPA").<br><br>
                Please note that other sites controlled, owned or operated by 
                IAC Search &amp; Media or its affiliates - such as Ask.com and 
                Ask.co.uk, among others - are governed by a different privacy 
                policy even though they share the "Ask" brand. Please 
                see the privacy policy linked from the home page of each such 
                site for more information on the privacy practices on such site. 
                Also, this Privacy Policy does not govern information collected 
                through offline means in connection with the Ask for Kids site.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>1. What personal information does Ask for Kids collect?</b><br>
                Ask for Kids does not collect visitors' personally identifiable 
                information, nor does Ask for Kids require visitors to give personally 
                identifiable information in order to access or use our site. Ask 
                for Kids will not require a visitor to disclose more information 
                than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as 
                a condition of that participation. The Ask for Kids site contains 
                links to other Web sites (including those of our advertisers) 
                that may ask for personal information. Collection of personal 
                information on other Web sites will be governed by the terms of 
                that Web Site's privacy policy - not this Privacy Policy. Although 
                we try to review such sites carefully, IAC Search &amp; Media 
                and Ask for Kids expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability 
                for the privacy policies, data collection practices or regulatory 
                compliance of those independent sites.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>2. Does Ask for Kids use cookies?</b><br>
                Ask for Kids may track user visits and behavior on the site by 
                placing a "cookie" (a small file) on your computer's 
                hard drive or browser. The information we collect with cookies 
                helps us make improvements in site navigation and content so we 
                can serve you better or more efficiently. Users can remove cookies 
                from their computers if they want; the "Help" feature 
                of your Internet Explorer®, Netscape® or other browser 
                can show you how. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be 
                unable to use certain functionality of the Ask for Kids site. 
                The privacy policies of such advertisers - not this Privacy Policy 
                - will govern such activities. <br>
              <br>
                Ask for Kids occassionally uses advertising companies to serve 
                ads when you visit our Web site. In the course of serving advertisements 
                to our Web site, these companies may place or recognize a unique 
                cookie on your browser or use other technological tools to monitor 
                visitor activity. For example, these companies may use information 
                about your visit to our Web site in order to provide advertisements 
                about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Our privacy 
                policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party 
                ad server may collect from you. You can configure your Internet 
                browser to prevent many such types of information gathering. If 
                you would like more information about this practice, or would 
                like to know your choices about not having such information used 
                by these advertising companies, please click here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a></p>
              <p><br>
                <b>3. Does Ask for Kids collect aggregated information?</b><br>
                Ask for Kids collects statistics on which questions visitors ask 
                and which responses they select. We may also collect statistics 
                through a visitor survey. Ask for Kids does not ask for personally 
                identifiable information in these surveys and will delete any 
                personal information received from children. This information 
                is gathered together (aggregated) so that individual visitors 
                cannot be identified or distinguished from the whole. For example, 
                we might know that 100 visitors asked about giraffes, but we do 
                not know who those visitors were or who specifically asked about 
                giraffes. This information helps us make editorial and design 
                decisions to make Ask for Kids more helpful and even easier to 
                use. In addition, we may use this information to help us target 
                advertising or content for the site in general. We also may collect 
                IP Addresses (which domain a visitor is logged on from), Referral 
                Data (the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking 
                through to Ask for Kids), Browser type (which browser is being 
                used), Platform Type (whether a visitor uses Macintosh or Windows), 
                and Traffic Flow (where a visitor spends their time while on the 
                site) on our site, however these collected pieces of information 
                do not consist of personally identifiable information concerning 
                the visitor.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>4. Does Ask for Kids offer electronic postcards?</b><br>
                From time to time we may offer electronic postcards, which allow 
                visitors to create a card and email it to a friend. Visitors will 
                be asked to provide their email address and that of the receiving 
                friend. Ask for Kids will use these email addresses only for the 
                purpose of sending the electronic postcard and will not collect 
                or save such email address information. Any email addresses provided 
                by users in connection with the electronic postcard feature will 
                be deleted after use. </p>
              <p><br>
                <b>5. Does Ask for Kids have a chat room?</b><br>
                No, Ask for Kids does not operate chat rooms.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>6. Are questions posted to Ask for Kids private?</b><br>
                No, questions submitted to Ask for Kids are not private and may 
                be available to others, or used by Ask for Kids for its marketing 
                purposes, but will not be attributed to any particular user and, 
                if made publicly available on the Ask for Kids site, will not 
                include any personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b>7. What rights do parents have regarding their child's personal 
                information?</b><br>
                Ask for Kids will not collect, use or disclose personally identifiable 
                information from a child without parental notification or without 
                obtaining prior verifiable parental consent. At this time, no 
                personally identifiable information is being collected. Should 
                that change in the future, we will notify parents that we wish 
                to collect information, post the fact that information is being 
                collected, identify the type of information being collected, how 
                it is collected and used by Ask for Kids, and others, obtain consent 
                from parents in compliance with COPPA, and post the procedures 
                for parents to follow to review the information. If personally 
                identifiable information is collected, the parent can review the 
                child's personally identifiable information, ask to have it deleted 
                and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's 
                information.</p>
              <p><b><br>
                8. Sole Authorized Statement</b><br>
                This Privacy Policy is the sole authorized statement of Ask for 
                Kids' practices with respect to the online collection of personally 
                identifiable information via the Ask for Kids site and the usage 
                of such collected information. Any summaries of this Privacy Policy 
                generated by third-party software or otherwise (for example, in 
                connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" 
                or "P3P") will have no legal effect, are in no way binding 
                upon Ask for Kids, will not be relied upon in substitute for this 
                Privacy Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Privacy 
                Policy.</p>
