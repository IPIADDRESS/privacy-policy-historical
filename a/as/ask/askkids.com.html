            <p><b>Last Updated On: September 29, 2016<br>
            </b><br>
                At Ask.com, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to
                us. This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information collected by the Ask family
                of companies consisting of IAC Publishing, LLC., APN, LLC and Mindspark Interactive Network,
                Inc. (“Ask”, “we”, “us”, “our”) through the use of (i)
                our websites (the “Website”), (ii) our Ask mobile applications and (iii) “Search Applications,” a search
                box on an application or site from which you can access our search services, specifically provided by
                APN, LLC and/or Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. (collectively the “Services”).</p><br>

            Below we describe what information we collect when you use our Services, how we protect that information,
            how long we retain it, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you
            consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
            We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our
            users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically
            for updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy
            here, along with its effective date, and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our Website. Your
            continued use of the Services after our posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you agree to be
            bound by such changes.
            <p></p> <br><br>

            <p><b>1. What information do we collect about you? </b></p>

            <p>We explain below the main ways that we collect and process information about you.</p><br>

            <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide To Us:</span></b></p><br>

            <p>Your use of the Services may require registration, in which case we will ask you to provide certain
                personal information, including an email address, username, and password. You may also decide to provide
                us with some optional demographic information to enhance your profile, such as your country of
                residence, home address, education, interests, and communications preferences.</p><br>

            <p>You may also provide personal information to us, if you choose to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> sign up to receive our “Question of the Day” or any similar service or request to
                    receive certain other communications from us;
                </li>
                <li> submit a help request, a customer services inquiry or other inquiry to us, or fill in any other
                    forms for the purposes of receiving our Services;
                </li>
                <li>participate in some of the features accessible via the Services (for example, message boards, chat
                    groups, social networking, games, surveys, polls, promotions, contests, or sweepstakes);
                </li>
                <li> contact us about employment opportunities posted to the Services; or
                </li>
                <li>otherwise use the Services in a manner that you have requested.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on which of these or any other Services you use, the personal information you provide may
                include your name, email address, user name, home address, telephone number, information posted by you
                on sites accessed via the Services. Also, if you choose to login to a product or feature accessed
                through a Search Application via a social networking site, you are granting us permission to access and
                use information about you provided by the social network. For example, if you use a social network
                feature to login to a product accessed through a Search Application, per such social network’s policies,
                they may provide us access to you and your friends names, pictures, genders, user Ids, connections and
                any content shared using an “Everyone” or similar privacy setting. Please be aware, that by posting
                information to message boards, chat groups or social networking facilities available via the Services,
                you will be making this information available to other users of these Services to the public. You should
                be careful about revealing any sensitive details about yourself.

            <p>When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store certain information about your computer or

                location if you’ve enabled collection of that information, or general geographic location

                further information.</p>
            <p>(9) If you installed a Search Application, we may also collect information about that Search Application
                (e.g. the specific release date and distribution source of your Search Application, a unique Search
                Application ID, Search Application partner ID, the ads you click on, and information contained in error
                log files or cookies, aggregate query or click data and erroneous domain name system requests).</p><br>

            <p><b>4. Cookies and Online Advertising:</b></p>

            <p><b>Cookies.</b> We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other such similar technologies to collect
                and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device and Service usage. A
                cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer and a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or
                clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad
                or email). We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar
                technologies.
            </p>

            <p>There are two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your
                computer or mobile device, and (2) third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.
                Cookies have a lot of jobs. For example, our cookies enable us to recognize you (e.g. as a registered
                user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings. We use third party cookies
                for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes. Cookies from
                advertising companies, for example, help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more
                relevant to you and your interests. To understand more about cookies and pixel tags, click <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here.</a></p> <br>

            <p><b>Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile.</b> Advertisers and advertising networks place ads
                (including sponsored links in search results) on our website and in our mobile applications. These
                companies, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may use cookies, pixel tags, mobile
                device IDs and other similar technologies to collect data about you when you visit our site. They use
                the data to enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record
                your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you. You may opt-out of receiving
                targeted online advertising from advertising networks that is delivered on Ask.com and other websites by
                visiting the following websites:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>)

            <p>Please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop cookies
                on our website.</p>
            <p>If you are using an Ask mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you
                when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also
                use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile
                services that you use.</p>
            <p>If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to
                your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: <a href="http://oo.apple.com/">http://oo.apple.com</a>. If you are using an iOS6 device, you also
                may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap “General” then tap “About”; Scroll to
                the bottom of About and tap “Advertising”; Flip “Limit Ad Tracking” to ON. If you are using an Android
                device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Preferences</a> page from a browser on your
                device and make your choices there. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to
                control receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the platform provider if the
                above options are no longer available.</p><br>
            <p><b>Mobile Device Location Information.</b> When you use one of our location-enabled services (for
                example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information
                about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and
                the time the location information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for
                the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold
                about you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If
                you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this
                purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If you do not want
                your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these
                instructions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and
                    Privacy.” This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you
                    download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access
                    your location information.
                </li>
                <li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the
                    boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.
                </li>
                <li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location,
                    please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the
                    collection of this information.

            <p><b>Do Not Track.</b> Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web
                browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain
                information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
            <p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website
                for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital
                Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated
                DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means,
                what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p><br>
            <p><b>6. How do we keep the information we collect secure? </b></p>

            <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and
                organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing
                and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to personal information about
                you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to
                do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee
                the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><b>7. How long do we keep the information we collect?</b></p>

            <p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business
                purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you
                provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer
                periods of time.
