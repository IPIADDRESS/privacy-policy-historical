For example, if you decide to become a Member, you must complete a registration form and submit certain Registration Information (as defined below) to Myspace. We may also collect Personal Information and/or Demographic Information through a variety of other methods, including when you elect to contact us, submit Profile Content (as defined below), or otherwise interact with the Myspace Services.</span></p> <ul style="list-style:none;"> <li><span><strong>Registration Information</strong></span> <p><span>Certain features of the Myspace Services are only accessible by Members who have registered with Myspace and created a Myspace account ("<strong>Account</strong>"). In order to do so, you must first complete a registration form that requests certain basic registration information from you, such as your full name, e-mail address, date of birth, and gender (collectively, "<strong>Registration Information</strong>"). Please note that the Registration Information requested by Myspace may include both Personal Information and Demographic Information.</span></p> <p><span>When you create an Account, you will be asked to select a username and password. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password, and you may change your password. You are responsible for all uses of your password, whether or not such use has been authorized by you.</span></p> <p><span>Except as may otherwise be authorized in this Policy, or the Myspace Services' <a href="terms" name="Terms of Use" target="_blank" id="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>, you are also responsible for ensuring that any information you provide to Myspace (including Registration Information) is true, accurate, and complete in all respects.</span></p> </li> <li><span><strong>Profile Content</strong></span> <p><span>If you decide to become a Member, you will also create one or more Myspace profiles that are associated with your Account (each, a "<strong>Profile</strong>"). Myspace may allow you to populate your Profile with certain content, and we may also associate certain additional content with your Profile based on your interactions with the Myspace Services, such as your video viewing and other related activities (collectively, "<strong>Profile Content</strong>"). Any Profile Content that Myspace allows you to submit must comply with the restrictions set forth in our <a href="terms" name="Terms of Use" target="_blank" id="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> at all times. Please note that your Profile Content may contain Registration Information.</span></p> <p><span>The information in your Profile Content is grouped into two main categories – Public Information and Restricted Information.</span></p> </li> </ul> <p><span><strong>"Public Information"</strong> refers to the portion of your Profile Content that can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services (<em style="font-style:italic">e.g.</em>, Myspace, other Users, search engines, advertisers, application developers, other third parties, etc.). Any Profile Content that does not otherwise constitute Restricted Information (as defined below) is considered Public Information for the purposes of this Policy. At a minimum, Public Information includes your:</span></p> <ul class="infoPointers"> <li>Full Name</li> <li>Username</li> <li>Profile URL</li> <li>About Me (the portion of your Profile that provides a place to describe yourself)</li> <li>Profile Photo</li> <li>Profile Cover</li> <li>Stated Location</li> <li>Gender</li> <li>Age</li> <li>Myspace IDs</li> </ul> <p><strong>Public Information also includes:</strong></p> <ul class="infoPointers"> <li>Any additional Profile Content associated with a "<strong>Public Profile</strong>," which refers to any Profile for which a User has set the Profile's visibility status to "Public" in his or her Profile Settings (as defined below); </li> <li>Activity Notifications (as defined below) published on the Myspace Services from Public Profiles;</li> <li>Your status as a "Top Fan" (as defined below);</li> <li>Affinity Information (as defined below); and</li> <li>The number of your connections in and connections out.</li> </ul> <p><span>By contrast, "<strong>Restricted Information</strong>" refers to those portions of the Profile Content and Activity Notifications (as defined below) associated with your Profile to which you may elect to restrict access by changing the Profile settings that Myspace may make available to you from time-to-time <a href="/settings/profile" name="Profile settings" target="_blank" id="Profile settings">here</a> ("<strong>Profile Settings</strong>"). These Profile Settings may permit you to create a "<strong>Restricted Profile</strong>" by choosing to enable certain (but not absolute) limitations on the availability of certain aspects of your Profile that are not Public Information, certain associated Profile Content, and some of the notifications that Myspace produces regarding your activities ("<strong>Activity Notifications</strong>"). Further, unless otherwise provided by Myspace, all of your Profile Content and Activity Notifications will still be available to the Profiles that you allow to connect to you. Please note you are currently unable to restrict access to Public Information, which can always be viewed, accessed, and used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services, including via third party search engines.</span></p> <p><span>Although access to Restricted Information will be limited as set forth above, it is important to note that if you share such information with others, they may copy that information or share it with others, including with the public. Myspace is not responsible for the actions of those with whom you choose to share your Restricted Information. For example, you may choose to use the Myspace Services to access "<strong>Object Pages</strong>," which are those pages that, for example, represent an individual item of content such as video or audio, or a collection of content such as audio tracks (<em style="font-style:italic">i.e.</em>, "mixes") (each, an "<strong>Object</strong>"). When you decide to post content, comments, or other materials to another Member's Profile, an Object Page, or elsewhere on the Myspace Services, that information will be disclosed, and available to third parties consistent with the visibility settings for the relevant Profile or Object, <strong>even if those settings are inconsistent with your own Profile Settings</strong>. Object Pages are generally publicly available, which means that posts that you make on those pages will likely be available to anyone. In addition, your video viewing or audio selections may be part of your Profile Content as well as any Object Pages that you view. Similarly, if you connect to a Public Profile, the fact that you have connected to that Public Profile will be available to anybody with access to the Myspace Services.</span></p> <p><span>The Profile Settings that Myspace makes available to Members, as well as their functionality, may change as the Myspace Services continue to evolve. We will provide reasonable advance notice of the changes in the Profile Settings section, or otherwise. Delays and errors in effecting Profile Setting preferences may occur and we do not represent that they will be immediate, complete, error-free, current, reliable or accurate. If you experience any problems with your Profile Settings, or have any questions or concerns regarding your Profile Settings, or you are interested in obtaining additional information regarding the settings options that may be available to you, please contact us at the <a href="/help" name="Help Site" target="_blank" id="Help Site">Help Site</a>.</span></p> <p><span>You should be aware that the default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are 18 years of age or older is public (<em style="font-style:italic">i.e</em> Public Profiles). The default setting for Profiles of Members who indicate that they are under 18 years of age is restricted (<em style="font-style:italic">i.e</em> Restricted Profiles), other than for Artist Profiles (as defined in the <a href="terms" name="Terms of Use" target="_blank" id="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>) of Members who are under 18 years of age, which are public by default. Other than with respect to Artist Profiles whose visibility status may not be changed, you may change the visibility status of your Profile from a Public Profile to a Restricted Profile at any time by visiting <a href="/settings/profile" name="Profile settings" target="_blank" id="Profile settings">Profile Settings</a>. Please note, however, that Activity Notifications that were created during the time that your Profile was a Public Profile shall remain public after any change to a Restricted Profile.</span></p> <p><span>More detailed information about Myspace's Profile Settings is available <a href="/settings/profile" name="Profile settings" target="_blank" id="Profile settings">here</a>.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Account ID And Profile ID</strong></span></p> <p><span>When you create an Account, Myspace assigns an "<strong>Account ID</strong>" to identify and organize information relating to your Account and a "<strong>Profile ID</strong>" for each Profile associated with an Account (collectively, your "<strong>Myspace IDs</strong>"). The Profile ID may allow Myspace to provide a unique internet URL for your Profile ("<strong>Profile URL</strong>"). As described above, Myspace IDs and/or Profile URLs constitute Public Information and may therefore be viewed, accessed, and/or used by anyone with access to the Myspace Services. You cannot restrict access to Public Information through your Profile Settings. Please note that we may link your Myspace IDs with other information about you.</span></p> </li> <a id="3.2." name="Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services"></a> <!-- 3.2. --> <li><span>Information We Collect Or Store As You Access And Use The Myspace Services</span> <p><span>In addition to the information that you choose to submit to us via the Myspace Services, we and our third-party service providers may also collect certain information about you automatically, including through the use of various technologies that passively store or collect certain information whenever you interact with the Myspace Services.

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Myspace Services' pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including to: count visitors to the Myspace Services, to monitor how users navigate the Myspace Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</span></p> <p><span><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong>.
