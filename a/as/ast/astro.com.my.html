        PRINCIPLES<br>
        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Because your 
        privacy is important to us, ASTRO operates this Web Site by the following 
        principles: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Principle 1. <br>
        ASTRO explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies 
        you ("Profile Information"). ASTRO asks for your first and last name, 
        state and zip code, gender, year of birth, and occupation. You may update 
        this information at any time from within your ASTRO web member account 
        by clicking the "Update My Profile" button on the navigation bar, and 
        then fill in the relevant information. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Principle 2. <br>
        Your Profile Information is used only for demographic statistics and to 
        display appropriate individualized advertisements. ASTRO keeps all of 
        your Profile Information private and does not share it with any third 
        parties. ASTRO will not disclose your Profile Information unless acting 
        under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(1) conform to legal 
        requirements or comply with legal process; <br>
        (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ASTRO; <br>
        (3) enforce the ASTRO Terms of Service; or <br>
        (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Principle 3. <br>
        ASTRO will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, 
        except as mentioned below. New users will receive a ASTRO welcome letter 
        explaining the features provided by the service. Under exigent circumstances, 
        ASTRO may be required to send you information about the service or your 
        account, but ASTRO will not send you unsolicited e-mail regarding any 
        commercial offers or advertisements at any time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Principle 4. <br>
        If at any time you believe that ASTRO has not adhered to these principles, 
        please notify us by e-mail at privacy@astro.com.my and we will use all 
        commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the 
        problem. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Websites that have 
        links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about 
        you. The data protection practices of those websites linked to ASTRO are 
        not covered by this policy statement. You are advised to check the data 
        protection policies of these third party websites yourself before using 
        those sites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If you have questions 
        about this policy, please e-mail us at smd_sub@astro.com.my. For more 
        information about our privacy statement, see the following Frequently 
        Asked Questions (FAQs). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">FAQs 
        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
        (1) Does ASTRO collect other forms of information about its users? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In addition to the 
        use of Profile Information to operate the site, ASTRO also gathers anonymous 
        information, which may be used by ASTRO or shared with its advertisers. 
        This is information which does not personally identify you, but which 
        may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we 
        offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" 
        and may entail the use of "Cookies", "IP addresses" or other numeric codes 
        used to identify a computer. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(2) How do I correct 
        or change Profile Information that I have give to ASTRO? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">You may update this 
        information at any time from within your ASTRO account by clicking the 
        "Update My Profile" button on the navigation bar, and then fill in the 
        relevant information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(3) Is my Profile 
        Information secure from others using the ASTRO site?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Profile Information 
        collected by ASTRO is stored in secure operating environments that are 
        not available to the public. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(4) How else might 
        someone learn of my Profile Information while visiting another site? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In addition to directly 
        providing information to ASTRO, you might also provide Profile Information 
        through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or bulletin board use made available 
        to you on other sites, including other sites. Chat sessions and bulletin 
        board or newsgroup use is considered public and you are responsible for 
        your actions in these areas. The ASTRO Privacy Statement does not cover 
        this type of transfer of your Profile Information. You should always be 
        careful when distributing your Profile Information in this manner. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(5) What are cookies?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Cookies are pieces 
        of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk 
        for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing 
        information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies 
        is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide 
        useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not 
        personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. 
        Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, 
        you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take 
        full advantage of a Web site if you do so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF9900">USER 
        SUBMISSIONS</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">

        </font></p>
