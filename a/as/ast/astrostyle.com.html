      activities of this site are carried out in compliance with the Children's

      child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary
      to participate in the free AstroStyle.com website. </p>
    <p class="style2">On certain occasions, AstroStyle.com may offer sweepstakes
      promotions and/or contests. Children under the age of 13 will be asked

      him/her the child has registered and provide him/her with information about
      the program and give instructions on how the parent can remove the child
      from the promotion and/or contest. AstroStyle.com will use the collected
      information (emails) ONLY to notify the promotion and/or contest winners
      and their parent that they have won. AstroStyle.com requires the winners'

      submit his/her parent's email address. </p>
    <p class="style2">When we receive a request to purchase a membership or merchandise

      the parent along with instructions on purchasing the membership online
      or via telephone or mail is sent to the parent. The parent must fill out
      the personally identifiable information needed including the parent's credit
      card number to consent to the child's purchase and participation in the
      ASTROSTYLE&nbsp; Fan Club. </p>
    <p class="style2">Message Board Policy : Participants must have a paid annual
      membership, which requires parental consent for a child under the age of

      name, home address, email address, telephone number, or any other personally
