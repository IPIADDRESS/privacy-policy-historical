          -=MadCool=- Inc has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
          our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information 
          gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.MadCool.com.<br>
          <br>
          -=MadCool=- Inc occasionally will offer links to other sites. Please 
          know that when you enter these other sites (using links on madcool.com's 
          site) you are entering a site for which MadCool.com has no responsibility. 
          These links are provided in order to better round out your entertainment 
          experience. However, we can not guarantee the same level of confidence 
          at these sites. Please contact the web administrator of the individual 
          third party sites if you have any comments or concerns.<br>
          <br>
          We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via 
          e-mail, information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information 
          and/or site registrations.<br>
          <br>
          The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded, 
          used to improve the content of our Web page, used to notify consumers 
          about updates to our Web site,and not shared with other organizations 
          for commercial purposes.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to cookies: We set cookies only for use with the shopping 
          cart system of KKDS.<br>
          <br>
          If you do not want to receive e-mail from our newsletter that you have 
          opt in for, please let us know by sending us e-mail at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@madcool.com">unsubscribe@madcool.com</a>.<br>
          <br>
          Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only 
          receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders 
          they have placed on-line.<br>
          <br>
          When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape 
          Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some 
          information to -=MadCool=- Inc every time you access content on one 
          of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web 
          page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) 
          address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are 
          using to access our site. All of this information is collected by -=MadCool=- 
          Inc and is used to help improve our offerings to you. For instance, 
          from this information we determined that very few of our customers use 
          older browser versions. Because of this we recently decided to enhance 
          the quality of content available to all of our customers by using the 
          advanced features of HTML that cannot be accessed from those older browser 
          versions. All of the information that is automatically submitted to 
          us by your browser is considered Anonymous Information.<br>
          <br>
          Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information 
          about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through 
          the use of cookies. Due to the way the Internet technically operates, 
          we cannot control this collection of information - but we can control 
          which companies are allowed to place such advertising on our site. <br>
          <br>

          of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact<br>
