					IMPORTANT: Please note in particular that any accreditations or descriptions of quality such as a star rating have been placed on the Site by accommodation providers and not by us. We do not independently verify star ratings and the star is only indicative of what level of quality you can expect from a particular accommodation provider.&nbsp;

				<p>
					As LateRooms acts only as a booking agent we will have no responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies in any documentation supplied by the accommodation providers.
				</p>

In the event of an error or mistake being made, we or the accommodation provider reserve the right to cancel your booking and refund all monies paid (if relevant), this will be without any liability to you. We will make all reasonable effort to advise you of any cancelled bookings as soon as possible.
				</p>

					<a href="/en/static/TermsOfUse.mvc#s4">here</a>

				</p>

					In the event that you call LateRooms by telephone, or are called by LateRooms regarding your booking, calls may be recorded for monitoring and training purposes. In the event of a dispute regarding a booking, LateRooms reserves the right to review any call information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Special requests</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					COTS (UK) /CRIBS (US) - please advise at the time of booking if you require a cot or crib, in order that this information is given to the accommodation provider. We cannot guarantee this request will be met. Such requests will be subject to availability and if the accommodation is unable to meet any such request, neither LateRooms, nor the accommodation, will have any liability to you in this respect. This request may only be available at an additional cost unless otherwise expressly stated in the description of the accommodation provider, and if any additional cost is applicable this should be paid by you direct to the accommodation provider.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Special access requirements:&nbsp;</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have special requirements, such as needing a room with wheelchair access, please contact us before making your booking so that we can ensure that your needs can be meet. Please note that all such special requests are subject to availability and LateRooms cannot guarantee that all accommodation providers will be able to meet your needs.

				<h3 id="s32">Confirmation</h3>
				<p>
					To confirm a booking, you must be authorised to make the booking by all persons named on the booking and their parent or guardian for all party members who are under 18 when the booking is made. By making the booking, you are confirming that all persons named on the booking accept the Terms and that you will inform the other persons named on the booking of the confirmation details and any other appropriate information. By making the booking you also become responsible for making all payments due under the booking.
				</p>
				<p>
					The display of hotel rooms for sale on our Site is an invitation to treat only.
				</p>
				<p>
					By clicking the ‘Accept’ button you agree to these Terms. By completing and submitting the booking form you are making an offer to book temporary accommodation room nights, which if accepted by accommodation providers, will result in a binding contract made between you and the accommodation provider. &nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Neither completing the booking process online or making a booking via the telephone constitutes acceptance of your offer. &nbsp;We will send you an email confirmation following your booking on behalf of the accommodation provider confirming acceptance of your offer and forming the legally binding contract subject to any applicable terms and conditions of these Terms.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					LateRooms will never take payment; the card details requested are simply passed to the accommodation providers to secure and guarantee your booking. Your credit or debit card details may be used by some accommodation providers and/or LateRooms’ sister company, Liberate S.L.U., to carry out pre-authorisation checks. &nbsp;The details may also then be used by accommodation providers to take advance payment or a cancellation fee or no show fee, if applicable. If you have booked an advance purchase rate, the accommodation provider will be allowed to charge the entire amount of the booking to the credit/debit card upon receiving the confirmation of the booking. We will only ever ask you to provide us with your card details on the secure booking form or directly on the phone to one of our contact centre staff members. You should never email your card details to us.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Where accommodation providers process your credit or debit card details in connection with the provision of a booking, they will be bound to obtain and maintain any necessary accreditation required to provide payment processing services to you and shall be obliged to operate in accordance with the standards outlined in Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) published on the website www.pcisecuritystandards.org. You acknowledge that the accommodation provider rather than LateRooms is responsible for the security of cardholder data it possesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where a pre-authorisation check has been attempted and the card details provided are shown to not have sufficient funds, or the pre-authorisation fails for any other reason, the accommodation providers and/or we will attempt to contact you in order that you can provide an alternative method of payment. Should you not respond to our emails within 48 hours accommodation providers reserve the right to cancel your booking and re release your room for re sale&nbsp;

				<h3 id="s33">If you cancel, amend or change a booking</h3>
				<p>
					You may modify or cancel your booking at any time prior to your arrival date through the Site or by contacting us via telephone.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you cancel or amend your booking, there may be a cancellation charge or amendment fee levied by the accommodation or other service provider. In any event, if you fail to cancel or amend your booking in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation or amendment policy, you will be charged a cancellation or amendment fee by the accommodation or other service provider. Further details of cancellation policy are set out in our email to you confirming your booking and are also shown on the hotel's room details page prior to you making a booking.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If, for whatsoever reason, you do not turn up at the accommodation on the arrival date stated on your booking confirmation email, without prior warning to LateRooms ("a no show"), this shall be considered a cancellation. Accommodation providers may charge you a cancellation fee using the credit or debit card details that you provided to use when securing your booking, which we then pass on to our accommodation provider partners.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If you fail to arrive at your accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not tell the accommodation provider in advance, the accommodation provider may cancel the remaining days on your reservation and you may be charged a cancellation fee, please see details in the accommodation providers’ cancellation policy for details.
				</p>
				<p>
					The accommodation provider’s cancellation policy will continue to apply even after your arrival at your hotel. So for example, should you decide to shorten the duration of your stay, such a request will be dealt with at the discretion of the accommodation provider, and not by us in our capacity as the booking agent. &nbsp; If you amend your booking in this way there may be a cancellation fee levied by the accommodation provider and you should refer to the provider’s cancellation policy for more details.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the accommodation provider requires a minimum stay for rooms attracting a certain price, this will be clearly stated on our Site prior to booking.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Some accommodation providers may also charge additional fees for early check in or late check out. Please check the accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Advanced purchase bookings will attract full pre-payment at the time of booking. This payment and/or bookings cannot be amended, refunded or transferred in the event of cancellation.&nbsp;

					<p>
						LateRooms takes responsibility for making accessible web content and software seriously.

						At LateRooms we are working hard to provide access to services and information that are helpful to all our customers. Many Internet users with disabilities find web sites difficult to use simply because of the way they are designed. This Site has been designed to be as accessible as possible and to be compatible with the types of adaptive technology used by people with disabilities, including screen readers.
