				<p align="center" class="support_header">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text">We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our   firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices with   respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal   information provided by visitors to our web site. By using this site, you   signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms and conditions   of our web site. </p>
				<p align="left">If this policy is not agreeable to you, please   do not use this site.</p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS   COLLECTED?</strong><br>
					<br>
				  Personal   Information<br>
				  <br>
				  We only collect personal information from visitors to   our web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our   registration form or electing to use one of our services. We may require   visitors to provide us with information including, but not limited to, their   name, physical address, email address, birth date, credit card number, credit   card expiration date, username, password, and on occasion a unique identifier   (such as their motherï¿½s maiden name). </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>Non-Personal   Information</strong><br>
					<br>
				  When visitors access our web site, certain   non-personal information may be collected from them including, but not limited   to, their browser type (e.g., FireFox or Internet Explorer), operating system   (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they   accessed the site (e.g. google.com). In addition, we may collect information   about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the web   site, the areas or pages of our web site that they visit, the amount of time   spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor returns to the site, and   click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels to determine the number of   web site visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We do   not track any information about visitors once they leave our site. We may use   cookies (small text files that are stored on visitors computers when they access   our web site) to collect this information. Information collected through cookies   may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow   unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of   our web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they   may not be able to use certain features on our web site. The "help" segment of   the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept   new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when they receive a new   cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR   PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong><br>
					<br>
				  Our goal in collecting   personal information is to provide visitors with the most personalized web   experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the   right audience. By knowing a little about our visitors, we are able to deliver   more relevant content and advertisements, and provide better services. We may   use information collected from visitors to our web site for any of the following   purposes: (1) to send visitors information and promotional materials about our   company, (2) to send visitors information and promotional materials from our   marketing partners and third parties (such as advertisers on our web site), (3)   to deliver targeted display advertisements and offers by email (by matching   criteria provided by our advertisers with information collected from our   visitors), (4) to contact visitors to our web site when necessary, (5) to allow   one-click purchases or access to proprietary content by pre-populating fields,   within registration or other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing   address, and credit or charge card information (among other things), as provided   by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, (7) to   administer our web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to   determine the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand   visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our   site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting internal   reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater online   experience for our visitors. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR   INFORMATION?</strong><br>
					<br>
				  We may transfer or disclose information collected   from visitors to our web site to our employees and independent contractors, to   our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, and to our consultants, other   business associates, and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to   perform a business, professional, or technical support function for us, or if   required to do so by law. We may also disclose information we collect from our   site visitors to our marketing and business partners, who may use the   information in connection with their business operations, such as to send   marketing and other communications to visitors of our site. <br>
				  We may also   share, rent, sell, or transfer any personal information (including financial   information) provided by our visitors to third parties. During the registration   process, and at certain times during any member user session, we may present   additional offers from third party service providers. Our third party service   providers have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest   that visitors access these third party sites and review their terms and   conditions and privacy policies before "subscribing" to any third party offer.   If a visitor subscribes to a third party offer during our registration process,   we will transfer the financial data they provided to us as part of the   registration process to that third party company, which will then process the   transaction using that financial data. We may also share non-personal   information we collect from visitors to our site, such as their browsing   behaviors, with third parties. For example, we may tell a third party advertiser   that a certain number of people have visited a certain area on our web site. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE   TO PROTECT YOUR DATA?</strong><br>
					<br>
				  To help prevent unauthorized access,   maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have   put in place certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to   safeguard and secure the information we collect from visitors to our web site.   We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect any credit card   information you provide us. We allow access to personal information only to   persons and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy.   Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us (such as   data, questions or answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted   to a chat room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if   information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended   recipient. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S   PRIVACY</strong><br>
					<br>
				  Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important   to us. For that reason we do not structure any part of our site to attract   anyone under the age of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under   the age of 18 (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our site. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>CORPORATE   CHANGES</strong><br>
					<br>
				  In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock   sale, bankruptcy, or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any   of our assets may be transferred to a third party, including personal   information collected from visitors to our web site. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY TERMS &amp;   CONDITIONS</strong><br>
					<br>
				  By visiting this web site, you are agreeing to the   practices described in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also   accept, without limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions concerning   the use of this site. We may at any time revise these terms and conditions. You   are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this   page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which you are bound. To   the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible through our web site   (such as our advertisers) have different privacy practices from those stated in   this Privacy Policy, those third-party privacy practices govern the collection   and use of information you provide when visiting those sites. We are not   responsible for the policies, content, and practices of other companies. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY   POLICY</strong><br>
					<br>
				  There may be times when we need to change the terms of   this Privacy Policy. To ensure that you are aware of our current privacy   practices, please bookmark this page and check back often. </p>
				<p align="left" class="support_text"><strong>HOW TO CANCEL YOUR   SUBSCRIPTION</strong><br>
					<br>
