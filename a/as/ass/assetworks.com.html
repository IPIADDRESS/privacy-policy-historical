        <p>Your privacy is important to us. AssetWorks Inc. ("AssetWorks") is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the integrity of any identifiable information ("Personal Information") we collect about you.

<p><strong>Why AssetWorks May Collect Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>AssetWorks collects Personal Information and uses it in order to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Establish identity;</li>
	<li>Perform necessary identity and security verifications;</li>

</ul>

<p>AssetWorks will collect, use and may disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; and endeavors to collect as little information as possible as may be necessary under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Please note that aggregated statistics and information, where the identity of a specific individual cannot be identified, is not Personal Information. AssetWorks reserves the right to use aggregated information in any manner it determines, in its discretion, to be appropriate. Use of such aggregated information may include, but not be limited to, the preparation of aggregated user statistics and information summaries to improve efficiencies, more effectively describe our product and service offerings, and assist in the marketing of our products and services. Aggregated statistics and information will not contain Personal Information.</p>

<p><strong>What Type of Personal Information AssetWorks May Collect</strong></p>

<p>AssetWorks collects various types of Personal Information. During the course of doing business or interacting with AssetWorks, or receiving products and services from or through AssetWorks, you may depending on the nature of the circumstances be asked to provide AssetWorks with:</p>

AssetWorks may collect Personal Information through a variety of means:</p>

<ul>
