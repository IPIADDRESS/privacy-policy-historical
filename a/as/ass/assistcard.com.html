          <h3>(Effective September 9, 2015)</h3>
            <p class="lead">This website, located at www.starrassist.com (the “Website”), provides information about services offered by Starr Assist. Our address is 399 Park Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10022. Our data collection and use policies with respect to visitors to the Website are set forth in this statement (the “Policy”). By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>
          
          <h3>What is “personal information”?</h3>
            <p class="lead">When reviewing this Policy you should understand that when we use the term “personal information”, we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. When we refer to “aggregate information”, we mean information that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual, such as demographic information, purchase categories, or visitors using a particular browser to access the Website</p>           

          <h3>What types of personal information does Starr Assist collect on the Website? </h3>
            <p class="lead">We collect various types of personal information from visitors to the Website. For instance, we collect information through our “contact us” forms. When you submit questions or comments through the “contact us” or such forms, we may collect personal information such as first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number and the question or comment you submitted.</p>
          
          <h3>Does Starr Assist collect any other information about visitors to the Website?</h3>
            <p class="lead">We constantly seek to maintain the integrity of, and make improvements to, the Website. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyze certain aggregate information about how visitors use the Website, as stated below. When you visit our Website, we may collect various types of technical data including, but not limited to, domain and/or Web browser information. This data is gathered using cookies and other similar technologies. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor’s computer hard drive to enable that person to more easily communicate and interact with the Website and to provide us with important information on how visitors use the Website. This Website uses cookies to allow you to select a preferred location view and default home page view and to let you access recently visited links more easily. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. You will not be able to access a preferred location view, a customized default home page view or your recently visited links. In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that which is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address or any other contact information. Please note that certain aggregate information may be linked with personal information. Any such linked information will be treated as personal information for the purposes of this Policy as long as it is so linked.</p>

          <h3>What does Starr Assist do with personal information collected on the Website? </h3>
            <p class="lead">We will use personal information provided by visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided, as described in this Policy, or as disclosed at the time the visitor information is collected.

We also may use the information submitted to ask you follow-up questions about which products you have purchased or are considering purchasing, in order to improve our services and better understand your needs. We may store the information you submit via the “contact us” for such period of time as may be necessary, in our discretion, to resolve your inquiry or as may be needed/helpful to Starr Assist.</p>
