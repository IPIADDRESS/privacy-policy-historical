At times it may be necessary for us to provide your protected health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to provide written assurances to us that they will appropriately safeguard the privacy of your protected health information. </p>
<p><b>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment:</b> We may use or disclose protected health information to you or other family members who are covered under your health insurance policy regarding your care or payment related to your care.
