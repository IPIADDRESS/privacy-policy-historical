      <h2>NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES</h2>
      <p><b>This notice describes how medical information about you may be used 
        and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review 
        it carefully.</b> </p>
      <p>Effective date 4-14-03 </p>
      <p>Assurant Health is required by law to maintain the privacy of protected 
        health information and to provide the people we insure with this notice 
        of our legal duties and privacy practices. Assurant Health is required 
        to abide by the terms of the Notice. </p>
      <p><b>Who We Are</b> </p>
      <p>In business since 1892, Assurant Health provides health insurance coverage 
        for more than one million people nationwide. Assurant Health develops 
        and provides a wide range of individual medical, small group, short term 
        and student health insurance products, as well as non-insurance products. 
        Assurant Health also provides consumer-choice products such as Health 
        Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Arrangements. With almost 3,000 
        employees, Assurant Health is headquartered in Milwaukee, WI, and has 
        operations offices in Minnesota, Idaho, and Florida, as well as sales 
        offices across the country. Assurant Health products are underwritten 
        and issued by Time Insurance Company, John Alden Life Insurance Company 
        and Union Security Insurance Company. The Assurant Health Web site is 
        <a href="http://www.assuranthealth.com">www.assuranthealth.com</a>. Assurant 
        Health is part of Assurant, which offers specialized insurance products 
        and related services in North America and selected other markets. </p>
      <p><b>Information We Collect </b></p>
      <p>To serve your health insurance needs, Assurant Health collects information 
        about you. We may collect this information directly from you orally or 
        on applications or other forms. We also collect information from third 
        parties such as your agent or broker, your current or former health care 
        providers and consumer reporting agencies. In addition, this information 
        may include your transactions with Assurant Health, its affiliates and 
        others. It is impossible to describe every type of information that we 
        collect, but here are some examples: your name, age, address, Social Security 
        number, telephone number, occupation and other demographic information 
        about you and your family; whether you are a past or present customer 
        with us, or if you ever applied for an insurance product or service from 
        us, as well as your history of other insurance coverage and applications 
        (if you apply online, information is collected through an Internet “cookie,” 
        an information-collecting device from a web server); your past, present 
        or future physical, mental or behavioral health or condition; your health 
        care history; your history of insurance coverage, premiums, claims and 
        payments through Assurant Health; information from consumer reporting 
        agencies and data collection agencies.</p>
      <p><b>How Assurant Health May Use and Disclose Information About You </b></p>
      <p>We use and disclose information about you in serving your health insurance 
        needs. It is impossible to describe every type of information that we 
        use or disclose but we have provided some examples of how we use this 
        information to provide services to you and your dependents. </p>
      <p><b>Treatment:</b> Your health care provider may ask us to use or disclose 
        protected health information in connection with treatment, including the 
        provision, coordination, or management of health care and related services. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Payment:</b> We may use and disclose protected health information 
        for payment purposes, including billing, review of health care services, 
        determining whether a service is “medically necessary” and for 
        utilization review. For instance, a doctor or health facility involved 
        in your care may forward a claim to us with your protected health information. 
        Assurant Health must have this health information to process your claims. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Health Care Operations:</b> Assurant Health may use and disclose protected 
        health information as part of our health care operations. For example, 
        we may use and disclose information in the underwriting process, renewal 
        process, quality assessment activities or accreditation and certification. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Plan Sponsors:</b> If you are enrolled in a group health plan, Assurant 
        Health may provide protected health information to the plan sponsor. For 
        instance, we may share enrollment or disenrollment information with your 
        employer. </p>
      <p><b>Health-related Benefits and Services:</b> We may, from time to time, 
        contact you about treatment alternatives or other health related benefits, 
        products or services that may be of interest to you, and for case management 
        or care coordination. </p>
      <p><b>Business Associates:</b> Assurant Health works with companies and 
        consultants who perform a wide variety of functions on our behalf. For 
        example, we work with financial institutions such as agents, brokers, 
        insurance distributors, reinsurers and excess loss insurers, non-financial 
        institutions such as health care providers, detectors of fraud, auditors, 
        insurance support organizations, claims handlers, underwriters, and others 
        such as information technology specialists and consultants. At times it 
        may be necessary for us to provide your protected health information to 
        one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with 
        our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates 
        to provide written assurances to us that they will appropriately safeguard 
        the privacy of your protected health information. </p>
      <p><b>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment:</b> We may use or disclose 
        protected health information to you or other family members who are covered 
        under your health insurance policy regarding your care or payment related 
        to your care. If you object to our use or disclosure of your protected 
        health information in communications with other family members covered 
        under your health insurance policy, please contact our customer service 
        department and ask for the <a href="javascript:popUp('http://www.hipaa.assuranthealth.com/pdfs/Restriction.On.Disclosures.pdf',640,480)">Right 
        to Restrictions form</a>, or visit our Web site at <a href="http://www.assuranthealth.com">www.assuranthealth.com</a>. 
        This request must be made in writing and signed by you or your legally 
        authorized representative. </p>
      <p><b>Permitted or Required by Law:</b> Assurant Health may release information 
        when requested by law enforcement officials or when permitted or required 
        by law. If you are involved in a lawsuit or dispute, Assurant Health may 
        need to disclose protected health information in response to a court or 
        administrative order. </p>
      <p><b>More Stringent Laws:</b> Assurant Health offers health coverage in 
        many states across the nation. In some cases we may be required to follow 
        the state law provisions on use and disclosure of your protected health 
        information, which may be more stringent than those outlined in this notice. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Our Security Safeguards</b> </p>
      <p>Assurant Health has established safeguards to ensure the security and 
        confidentiality of information about you. These safeguards include protection 
        against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity 
        of the information, as well as protection against the unauthorized access 
        to or use of this information. We restrict access to your information 
        to those employees “who need to know that information” to provide 
        products or services to you or on your behalf. </p>
      <p>Any other use or disclosure of your protected health information may 
        only be made with your written authorization, which may be revoked under 
        certain circumstances at any time. </p>

        we maintain about you: </p>
