              <p align="left">We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds 
                of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted 
                form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices 
                to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of 
                data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely 
                secure, we believe the measures implemented by our web site reduce 
                the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to 
                the type of data involved. Asseenontvguys.com's servers use Secure 
                Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with 
                Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser, 
                so that only Asseenontvguys.com can read a customer's personal 
                information.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF6600">How long do we keep 
                user information?</font></strong></p>
              <p align="left">We generally keep user data on our server or in 
                our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter 
                this practice according to changing requirements. For example, 
                we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We 
                may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. 
                In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in 
                the public domain indefinitely.</p>
              <p align="left">Data management requests are administered in an 
                orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. 
                Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than 
                for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, 
                it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those 
                cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>
