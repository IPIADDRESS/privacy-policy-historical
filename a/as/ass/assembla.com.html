The data protection laws in certain

<p class="italic">Compelled Disclosure.</p>
<p>The Company may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith

<p class="italic">Any Data or other information you choose to submit in communities, forums, blogs or chat rooms
on our Websites may be read, collected and used by others who visit these forums, depending on your account
settings. </p>
<h3>5. Children and Privacy</h3>
<p>The Company Websites do not offer information intended to attract children. The Company does not knowingly
solicit personal information from children under the age of 16.</p>
<h3>6. Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>The Company take precautions including organizational, technical and physical measures to help safeguard
against the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration and unauthorized disclosure of, or access
to, the Data we process or use. For example, when you submit any form requiring registration, we use a
secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the
Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. Please note that while we have implemented
industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. You are
solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices and signing out of websites
after your sessions.</p>
<h3>7. Use of Cookies, Usage Data</h3>
<p><span class="italic">Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses</span>.<br>
The Company uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect
information as you navigate the Company’s Websites (“Website Navigational Information”). As described more
fully below, we and our partners use these cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer
Websites and Services, track users’ movements around our Websites and Services, serve targeted
advertisements and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This section describes the
types of Website Navigational Information used on the Company’s Websites and Services, and how this
information may be used.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data</span>.<br>
As is true of most Company Websites, we gather certain information automatically to analyze trends in the
aggregate and administer the Company’s Websites and Services. This information may include your Internet
Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application
identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile
carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration
information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when
you visit or use the Company’s Websites and Services, we automatically receive the URL of the website from
which you came and the website to which you go when you leave our Website. This information is used to
analyze overall trends, to help us improve our Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal
information, and to provide the Websites and Services. For example, the Company uses IP addresses to monitor
the regions from which customers and website visitors navigate the Company’s Websites. The Company also
collects IP addresses from customers when they log into the Services as part of the Company’s “Identity
Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
</p>
<p><span class="italic">Cookies</span><br>
The Company uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Websites easy and meaningful. When you
visit one of the Company’s Websites, the Company’s servers send a cookie to your computer or device.
Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you
choose to identify yourself to the Company, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account,
or filling out a Web form (such as a “Request a Demo” or a “Request a Quote” Web form) or have previously
identified yourself to the Company, you remain anonymous to the Company. The Company uses cookies that are
session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your
computer or device when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain
on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer. You can control the use
 of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of
certain features or functions on the Company’s Websites or Services.</p>
<p>The following sets out how the Company uses different categories of cookies.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Required Cookies</span>:<br>
Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company’s Websites and use its features, such as accessing
secure areas of the Websites and using the Company Services.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to the Company, the Company may place on your browser cookies
containing an encrypted, unique identifier. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when
you are logged into the Company’s Websites and Services and to process your online transactions and
requests. Therefore, there is no option to opt out of these cookies because they are essential to operate
the Websites.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Functionality Cookies</span>:<br>
Functionality cookies allow the Company’s Websites and Services to remember information you have entered or
choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal
features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of the Company’s Websites and Services after
logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other
parts of web pages that you can customize. Functional cookies may also be used to improve how the Company's
Websites and Services function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with the Company, and
to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications. These cookies
collect information about how website visitors use our Websites and Services, including which pages visitors
go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. The Company may use its own
technology (under the Company brand name or an affiliated brand name) or third parties to track and analyze
usage and volume statistical information from website visitors, attendees, and customers, to provide
enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of the Company's
advertisements. The Company and its third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or Flash
cookies for these purposes. Flash cookies and HTML local storage are different from browser cookies because
of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. The Company also uses Flash cookies, to store your
preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Company Websites and Services to personalize
your visit. In particular, we use Google Analytics (“Google Analytics”), a web analytics service provided by
Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies to help
us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors
have navigated to our websites, and the pages on our websites to which visitors navigate. This information
is used by us to improve the Company’s Websites. To opt out from data collection by Google Analytics, you
can download and install a browser add-on, which is available at
<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.

Note
that opting out of functional cookies may impact the functionality of our Websites and degrade your user
experience.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Targeting or Advertising Cookies</span>:<br>
The Company sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to show you ads for the Company products and
services that we think may interest you on any devices you may use and to track the performance of the
Company advertisements. For example, in these cases, cookies remember information such as which browsers
have visited the Company’s Websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal
information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after the Company receives
it. If the Company is using one of its own cookie-related products on our own Website, then a cookie related
to ads may appear on our Website under the Company or one of our affiliated company's name. The Company also
contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web
beacons (see below) on the Company’s Websites and Services, from emails, and on third-party Websites. Ad
networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by
collecting Website Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies.
These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop
computer, smartphone or tablet. Third parties use this information to provide advertisements about products
and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other Websites or mobile
applications on any of your devices. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our
marketing efforts. Third parties, with whom the Company partners to provide certain features on our Websites
or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store
information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how
data is stored. To manage the use of targeting or advertising cookies on the Websites, consult your
individual browser settings for cookies. To lear how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash
cookies, click

Various
browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Do Not Track</span>.<br>
Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or
“DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Websites’ visited by
the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. The Company does not currently commit to
responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Websites, in part, because no common
industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including
no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. The Company takes privacy and meaningful choice
seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
implementation of a standard.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Usage Data</span>.<br>
As it is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically in connection with the use of
the Website by individual users. This information may include IP address, device and application
identification numbers, browser type, location, the pages and files viewed, operating system and system
configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage. This information is used to
analyze overall trends, to help us provide and improve our Websites and to guarantee their security and
continued proper functioning. In addition, we gather certain information automatically as part of your use
of the Company cloud products and services, specifically for Assembla and Travis CI entities. This
information may include IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers,
location, browser type, internet service provider, the pages and files viewed, searches and other actions
you take, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your
usage. This information is used to maintain the security of the Services, to provide necessary
functionality, as well as to improve performance of the Services, to assess and improve customer and user
experience of the Services, to review compliance with applicable usage terms, to identify future
opportunities for development of the Services, to assess capacity requirements, to identify customer
opportunities and for the security of the Company generally (in addition to the security of our products and
Services). Some of the device and usage data collected within the Services, whether alone or in conjunction
with other data, could be personally identifying to you. Please note that this usage data is primarily used
for the purposes of identifying the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals),
apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as
part of our provision of the Services to our customers (where we act as a processor).</p>
<h3>8. Links to Other Websites and Public Forums</h3>
<p>Our Websites contain links to information on other websites. We do not have any control over these other
websites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you
provide while visiting those websites. Those websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you
have questions about how a website uses your information, consult that website's privacy statement. Portions
of this website may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors.
Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and
exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

<h3>10. For EU, UK and Swiss Individuals: Privacy Shield Notice for Personal Data Transfers to the United
States</h3>
<p>The Company’s Services comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield

Services adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict
between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles

<h3>11. Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding
our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a
request, please email <a href="mailto:compliance@idera.com">compliance@idera.com</a>.</p>
<h3>12. How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise your rights, please contact us by using the information in the “Contacting us” section 17 below.
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month and will contact you if we need additional
information from you in order to honor your request. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month, taking
into account the complexity and number of requests we receive. If you are an employee of the Company
customer, we recommend you contact your company’s system administrator for assistance in correcting or
updating your information. Some registered users may update their user settings, profiles, organization
settings and event registrations by logging into their accounts and editing their settings or profiles.</p>
<p>As described above, we may also process Data submitted by or for a customer to our cloud products and
services. To this end, if not stated otherwise in this Privacy Statement or in a separate disclosure, we
process such Data in the role of a mere processor on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates) who is the
responsible controller of the Data concerned. We are not responsible for and have no control over the
privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy
Statement. If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf a Company customer and you wish to exercise
any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquiry with the applicable customer
directly. Because we may only access a customer’s data upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to
make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Company customer who submitted your
data to us. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to
your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<h3>13. Retention Periods and Deletion</h3>
<p>The Company retains your personal information to the extent necessary to reasonably serve customer relations,
to meet our compliance and legal obligations, to enhance security and fraud prevention, and for audit
purposes. For example, we may retain your information during the time in which you have an account to use
our Website or Services and for a reasonable period of time afterward. We may also retain your information
during the period of time needed for the Company to pursue our legitim business interest, conduct audits,
comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We determine the appropriate
retention period for the Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Data processed, the
potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Data and whether we can achieve the
purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements
(such as applicable statutes of limitation).</p>
<p>When you decide to delete certain information in your account, we will fulfill your request and update this
information on our platform. We will also notify third parties that we authorized the use and share that
content of your request.</p>
<h3>14. Unsubscribe</h3>
<p>You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the
“unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of the Company’s marketing emails. Additionally, you may
unsubscribe <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1GbF-h-sCReOLtKDq35Bi-Qa5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a> or by contacting us at
any time at
<a href="mailto:compliance@idera.com">compliance@idera.com</a>. Please note that opting out of
marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your
current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations,
service announcements or security information.</p>
<h3>15. Information about International Transfers</h3>
<p>The Company primarily stores Data about the Company’s customers and Data about attendees in the United
States. To facilitate the Company’s global operations, the Company may transfer and access such information

countries.</p>
<p>Your Data may be collected (e.g. if you are visiting our Websites), transferred to and stored by us in the
United States and by our affiliates in other countries where we operate. The data protection and other laws
of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please
be assured that the Company does take steps pursuant to the laws in the United States to ensure that your
privacy is protected. In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your Data offers an adequate level
of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as
approved by the European Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or by ensuring the recipient is self-certify under the
EU-US Privacy Shield, which you can read more about in section 10 above. By visiting our Website or using
 our Services, you understand that your information will be transferred to our facilities and those third
parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>16. Changes to this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p>The Company reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our
practices, technologies, legal requirements and other factors. If we do, we will update the “effective date”
at the top of this Privacy Statement. If we make a material update, we may provide you with notice prior to
the update taking effect, such as by posting a conspicuous notice on our website or by contacting you using
