				<p>The Assistments Project collects data on student usage and performance throughout a students use of the system. However, such data is anonymous as we do not collect or store personally identifying information about our students. Thus, we will never ask for, or store, a last name or e-mail information for a student. The performance information stored by the Assistments Project is only shared directly with the student's teacher or teacher designees (such as their principal), and is not shared with any other third parties 
				ever.
				
				</p><p>In regard to teacher information, the Assistments Project does not share any information collected with any third party. All information collected (name, e-mail, etc.) by teacher tools is stored by Assistments Project but will never be sold or shared.
