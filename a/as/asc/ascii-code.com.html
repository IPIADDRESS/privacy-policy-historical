            <h6 class="mb-0">IP anonymization</h6>
            <b>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website for all visitors</b>. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.

The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
            <h6 class="mb-0">Browser plugin</h6>

            <h6 class="mb-0">Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</h6>
