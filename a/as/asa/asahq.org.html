Please take the time to read and understand this  Privacy Policy so you can understand how we use your personal information.<br>
                      <br>
                      When we use the term "personal information" we mean information  such as your first/middle initial or first name and last name, street address,  town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address  and any other information that would allow someone to identify you or contact  you. Personal information also includes information about your personal  preferences, survey or application responses and your transactions or  relationship with us, if you have been a user of the Site or you have provided  this type of information to ASA or its affiliates.<br>
                      <br>
                      This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set  forth in our Terms of Use. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this  Privacy Policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use. We  reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this  posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you  immediately upon posting. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and  Terms of Use often for updates.<br>

                      <br>
                      <strong>The Information We Collect</strong><br>
                      We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (i.e., generic  information that does not identify you personally) when you visit any of our  web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet  Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 2000 or  Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America  Online or Earthlink). We also may collect personal information about you when  you visit the Site and input information, whether you are registering to use  any services, features or functions of the Site, or otherwise in the course of  any other exchanges of information, transactions and activities. During  registration (and possibly at certain other times to enable your use of other  features or functions or for security purposes), you will be required to  provide us with certain information about you in order for us to allow you to  use the features and functions that we may offer on the Site, such as message  boards, electronic mail services, messaging services, registration and member  profile pages.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>How We Use the Information</strong><br>
                      We may use the information we obtain from you, including personal information,  to tailor your experience on the Site, to display content we think may be of  interest to you, or to let us customize what you see when you visit the Site  according to your preferences. We will use the personal information you provide  online only for the purpose(s) you have submitted. Examples of using your  personal information for the purpose(s) submitted include sending you an email  about updates to the Site or about an upcoming event if you have signed up for  updates. We also may conduct an occasional survey of our registered users, to  see how our Site can better serve you. In addition, we may send to you an  e-mail offering products or services that we think you may be interested in. <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>How We Share Your Personal Information</strong><br>

These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with email  distribution technology, services, and/or content for the operation and  maintenance of our Site. Access to your personal information by these  contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the  contractor to perform its limited function for ASA. We also contractually  require that our operations and maintenance contractors 1) protect the privacy  of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and 2) not  use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing  us with products and services as required by law.<br>

We reserve  the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user,  including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or  functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of  the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or  functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your personal  information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the  legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide  access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an  explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for  further inquiries.<br>
