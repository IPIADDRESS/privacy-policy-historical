                                    <nobr>§§22575-22579)</nobr> which require operators of websites to disclose how they
                                    respond to “do not track” (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other
                                    mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally

                                    different websites or online services. While some newer browsers have incorporated
                                    “Do Not Track” features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the
