<b>The Ashley Madison Agency Privacy Statement</b><p>THIS 
            AGREEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED ON: November 27th 2001. The Ashley Madison 
            Agency is firmly committed to privacy. The following discloses our 
            information gathering and dissemination practices for this 
            website.</p>
<p>The protection of your privacy is very important and we 
            have adopted the following practices to safeguard the 
            confidentiality of your personal information. We will notify all 
            advertisers via email of any change to this Privacy Statement, 
            unless you have opted-out of receiving email from us. From time to 
            time, changes to this Privacy Statement will also be communicated on 
            this site.</p>
<p><b>What information do you gather automatically from 
            visitors?</b></p>
<p>We use your IP address (the series of numbers 
            associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our 
            site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does not 
            disclose any personally revealing information about you.</p>
<p>We 
            do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising 
            and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small 
            pieces of information that a web site places on your computer's hard 
            drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a 
            personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of 
            cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are 
            uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies through your 
            browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected if 
            you have set your browser to reject cookies.</p>
<p><b>What information 
            will you ask me for?</b></p>
<p>When you establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley 
            Madison Agency service you will be asked for some general 
            identifying information which will enable us to provide you with 
            this individualized service. We gather contact information (like 
            your email address), and demographic information (like your city of 
            residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own 
            research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and 
            third party partners, however the information shared will be limited 
            to non-personally identifying demographic information shared under 
            cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become an 
            Advertiser, we collect financial information (like your credit card 
            number and expiry date). We will only use this information in the 
            course of providing our service to you.</p>
<p>Once you have 
            created an Ad Profile, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous 
            profile (nickname and personal description) where your gender is applicable. Depending on where 
            you place your Ad Profile, you will be asked for some personal but 
            non-identifying information to complete your profile (e.g., height, body type, race, religion, whether you 
            smoke, etc). This information is not linked in any way to your 
            personally identifiable information, for other members to see. 
            Obviously, if you provide us with a photograph some of your 
            information may become personally identifiable 
            information.</p>
<p><b>How will this information be used and who has 
            access to it?</b></p>
<p>We may 
            use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely 
            notices of promotions and mailbox status reports. Our site provides 
            you with the opportunity to receive different types of 
            communications from us.</p>
<p>Your non-personally 
            identifying demographic information is used to personalize your 
            experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to 
            compose your personal profile - which is associated with a 
            pseudonymous identity you have created - and to deliver targeted 
            advertising and promotional offers to you from external companies 
            that are of the highest relevance to your demographic profile. Other 
            than your mail box, your contact information is never available to 
            other members or organizations.</p>
<p>In the event that you decide 
            to establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison System, Male 
            members 
            will be asked for financial information (like credit card 
            number if paying by credit card) which cannot be read by others when 
            you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you 
            are in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the 
            bottom of your browser - appears "locked". Alternatively, you may 
            place your Ad Profile with a live Customer Service Representative by 
            calling 1-866-742-2218 from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday and 10am to 
            5pm Saturday, Statutory Holidays excluded.</p>
<p>The personally identifiable information we 
            collect from you is used for internet review and to improve the 
            content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout 
            of our pages for each individual member. The specific information we 
            collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never 
            release your personally identifiable information to any third party 
            or external 
            organization without your prior consent except for the purposes of 
            validating credit information and collecting debts, or unless we 
            reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of 
            law.</p>
<p><b>How long do you keep the information I've provided 
            you?</b></p>
<p>We keep the information you have given us for as long as 
            your Ad Profile stays active or hidden.</p>
<p><b>Can I change the information I 
            have already given you?</b></p>
<p>You can always verify or request the 
            removal of the personally identifiable information we have collected 
            and change your registration information by selecting "Member 
            Services" clicking on "Manage Profile" and making changes at 
            "Personal Information" 
            from the main menu on the site.</p>
<p>Any such request may also be 
            made by contacting the The Ashley Madison Agency Privacy Officer at 
            416-545-1599 from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, Statutory Holidays 
            excluded.</p>
						
						
<p><b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b></p>

<p>Our clients communicate with each other through onsite message mail and Instant Messaging. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor advertisers' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Statement. Submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the site.</p>
<p>Advertisers may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters.</p>
						
						
						
<p><b>Affiliates</b></p>
<p>When you register to become 
            an Affiliates, you will be asked for contact information. Your information will only be 
            used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external 
            to the company other than our advisors and representatives.</p>
