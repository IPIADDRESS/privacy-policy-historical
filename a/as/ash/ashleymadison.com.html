		<p align="justify"><b>What information do you gather automatically from visitors?</b><br>
		We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about you.</p>
		<p align="justify">
			We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to 
			facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information 
			that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. 
			This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of 
			cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can 
			disable all cookies through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected 
			if you have set your browser to reject cookies.</p>
		
		
		<p align="justify"><b>What information will you ask me for?</b><br>
		When you establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison Agency service you will be asked 
		for some general identifying information which will enable us to provide you with this individualized 
		service. We gather contact information (like your email address), and demographic information (like your city 
		of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional 
		advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally 
		identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become an 
		Advertiser, we collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date). We will only use this 
		information in the course of providing our service to you.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Once you have created an Ad Profile, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile 
		(nickname and personal description) where your gender is applicable. Depending on where you place your 
		Ad Profile, you will be asked for some personal but non-identifying information to complete your profile 
		(e.g., height, body type, race, religion, whether you smoke, etc). This information is not linked in any 
		way to your personally identifiable information, for other members to see. Obviously, if you provide us 
		with a photograph some of your information may become personally identifiable information.</p>
		
		
		<p align="justify"><b>How will this information be used and who has access to it?</b><br>
		We may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions 
		and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to receive different types of 
		communications from us.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, 
		allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is 
		associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created - and to deliver targeted advertising 
		and promotional offers to you from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your 
		demographic profile. Other than your mail box, your contact information is never available to 
		other members or organizations.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		In the event that you decide to establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison System, Male members 
		will be asked for financial information (like credit card number if paying by credit card) which cannot 
		be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure
		mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". Alternatively, 
		you may place your Ad Profile with a live Customer Service Representative by calling 1-866-742-2218 from 
		9am to 6pm EST Monday to Friday, Statutory Holidays excluded.</p>
		<p align="justify">
		The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve 
		the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual 
		member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never 
		release your personally identifiable information to any third party or external organization without 
		your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts, or
		unless we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law.</p>
		
		
		<p align="justify"><b>How long do you keep the information I've provided you?</b><br>
		We keep the information you have given us for as long as your Ad Profile stays active or hidden.</p>
		
		<p align="justify"><b>Accessing and Updating Your Email Notification Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information</b><br>
		You have the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal information or demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide information visible to the public users of the Ashley Madison Website System at anytime by going to the 'Manage Profile' or 'Message Center' sections of the Site.</p>
		<p align="justify">Please be aware that it may take several hours for any custom changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the system. Please also note that changing or deleting your information through the 'Manage Profile' or 'Message Center' section of the system, or opting-out of email notifications from us, will only change or delete the data in our database for the purpose of future activities and communications. These changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that are queued to be sent or have already been sent.</p>
		
		<p align="justify"><b>Unsolicited Email (SPAM)</b><br>
		The Ashley Madison Agency NEVER sends unsolicited email at any time ever, for any purpose. To receive notices
		or messages from our system, members must 'double opt-in'. (This does not include payment notifications or replies to
		emails you initiate to us) Additionally, we do not advertise our service using unsolicited email, nor do we
		permit our affiliates or channel partners to use unsolicited email either. Any abuse or evidence of unsolicited email
		that appears to have been initiated from us, directly or indirectly, should be brought to the immediate attention
		of our compliance officer by emailing manager@ashleymadison.com or by calling 1-866-742-2218, ext., 2202.</p>
		
		<p align="justify"><b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b><br>
		Our clients communicate with each other through onsite message mail and Instant Messaging. 
		While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor advertisers' private exchanges, we reserve 
		the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the 
		purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Statement. 
		Submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, 
		we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public 
		area of the site.</p>
		<p align="justify">Advertisers may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters.</p>
		
								
		<p align="justify"><b>Affiliates</b><br>
		When you register to become an Affiliates, you will be asked for contact information. Your information will only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives.</p>
