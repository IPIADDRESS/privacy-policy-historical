			<p><b>What information do you gather automatically from visitors?</b></p>
			
			<p>
				We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer)
				 to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does 
				 not disclose any personally revealing information about you.
			</p>
			<p>
				We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to 
				facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information 
				that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. 
				This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of 
				cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can 
				disable all cookies through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected 
				if you have set your browser to reject cookies.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>What information will you ask me for?</b></p>
			
			
			<p>
				When you establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison Agency service you will be asked 
				for some general identifying information which will enable us to provide you with this individualized 
				service. We gather contact information (like your email address), and demographic information (like your city 
				of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional 
				advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally 
				identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become an 
				Advertiser, we collect financial information (like your credit card number and expiry date). We will only use this 
				information in the course of providing our service to you.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once you have created an Ad Profile, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile 
				(nickname and personal description) where your gender is applicable. Depending on where you place your 
				Ad Profile, you will be asked for some personal but non-identifying information to complete your profile 
				(e.g., height, body type, race, religion, whether you smoke, etc). This information is not linked in any 
				way to your personally identifiable information, for other members to see. Obviously, if you provide us 
				with a photograph some of your information may become personally identifiable information.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>How will this information be used and who has access to it?</b></p>
			
			<p>
				We may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions 
				and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to receive different types of 
				communications from us.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience, 
				allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is 
				associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created - and to deliver targeted advertising 
				and promotional offers to you from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your 
				demographic profile. Other than your mail box, your contact information is never available to 
				other members or organizations.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the event that you decide to establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison System, Male members 
				will be asked for financial information (like credit card number if paying by credit card) which cannot 
				be read by others when you initiate your order through a secured system. You will know you are in secure
				 mode when the tiny padlock icon - located at the bottom of your browser - appears "locked". Alternatively, 
				 you may place your Ad Profile with a live Customer Service Representative by calling 1-866-742-2218 from 
				 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday and 10am to 5pm Saturday, Statutory Holidays excluded.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve 
				the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual 
				member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never 
				release your personally identifiable information to any third party or external organization without 
				your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts, or
				 unless we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>How long do you keep the information I've provided you?</b></p>
			
			<p>
				We keep the information you have given us for as long as your Ad Profile stays active or hidden.
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Can I change the information I have already given you?</b></p>
			
			<p>
				You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable 
				information we have collected and change your registration information by 
				selecting "Member Services" clicking on "Manage Profile" and making changes 
				at "Personal Information" from the main menu on the site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Any such request may also be made by contacting the The Ashley Madison Agency Privacy Officer at 416-545-1599 from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, Statutory Holidays excluded.
			</p>
														
			<p><b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b></p>
			
			<p>
				Our clients communicate with each other through onsite message mail and Instant Messaging. 
				While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor advertisers' private exchanges, we reserve 
				the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 or of using our service for the 
				purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our terms of use or Privacy Statement. 
				Submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, 
				we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public 
				area of the site.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Advertisers may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters.
			</p>
									
									
									
			<p><b>Affiliates</b></p>
			<p>
				When you register to become an Affiliates, you will be asked for contact information. Your information will only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives.
