<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) is provided to explain the online information practices of Ashoka (“Ashoka,” “us” or “we”) and the choices you can make about the way that data which directly or indirectly identifies you (“Personal Data”) is collected and used at Ashoka websites (collectively, the “Site”). We are a company established in the United States with principal place of business at 1700 North Moore Street Suite 2000, Arlington, VA 22209 USA. For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”), we are the data controller and our representative in the EU is ASHOKA gemeinnützige GmbH, a private limited company with registered number FN 362512g established in Vienna, Austria with a registered office at Haus der Philanthropie, Schottenring 16, 3. OG, 1010 Vienna, Austria. We use your Personal Data only in accordance with the following principles and in compliance with applicable data protection laws including the GDPR.</p>

<p>The official language of this Privacy Policy shall be in the English language except as required by local law. Any translations of this Privacy Policy shall be for reference purposes only. The terms of this Privacy Policy in the English language shall prevail over any terms of any translations hereof in the event any dispute arises regarding any conflicting terms.</p>

<p>Please read this policy carefully so that you understand your rights in relation to your Personal Data, and how we will collect, use and process your Personal Data. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not access the Site. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the effective date listed above and is subject to change as set forth below in “Changes to the Ashoka Privacy Policy.”</p>

<p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p>The Site’s web servers collect standard internet log information during user visits to the Site. This information is used to assist with troubleshooting issues with the Site including performance and security related functions. In addition to server logs, the Site also uses the Google Analytics service to help us assess how users access and utilize the Site by collecting bits of information such as statistical usage and telemetry information including an anonymized version of your IP address. This information is used to create aggregate statistics about the operation and use of the Site such as when the Site is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to the Site, and other information that helps us understand how the Site is used and how it might be improved in the future.</p>

<p>Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our Site. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Site. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our Site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<p>In general, when you visit the Site we only incidentally collect such information as your IP address and/or information about your browser or computing device that enables us to provide you with access to the Site and appropriate content. There are pages, however, on which you need to provide additional Personal Data to register, make a donation, contact us, request news and updates, or conduct other transactions via the Site.</p>

<p>Such Personal Data will include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>name, address, website address, social media handle, and contact information;</li>
	<li>organization (including the organization’s name, website, phone number, and address), fields of work, languages and location;</li>
	<li>the results of any questionnaires that you agree to respond to.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Site enables you to submit Personal Data as part of an application for employment through the Job Board (the “<strong>Job Board</strong>”). Such Personal Data includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Name, contact information, work experience, educational qualifications, ability to work in the country for which you are applying for employment, and any information you choose to submit or upload to the Job Board.</li>
	<li>We receive information from third parties in connection with your application, such as referees and recruiters.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also provide to us Personal Data related to other people, for example to nominate a Fellow or recommend someone for employment. As part of this process, you will need to provide Personal Data, such as name, contact information, location, organization, fields of work, and other related information, to us about persons other than yourself. You agree to and confirm that you have sought and received consent to share such person’s Personal Data with us prior to submission. Ashoka will confirm this consent within one (1) month of receipt using the provided contact information. In the absence of consent confirmation, Ashoka will delete such Personal Data.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p>As it is in our legitimate interests to be responsive to you and to ensure the proper functioning of our products and organization, we will use your information to: process donations, provide requested information about our organization, evaluate employment candidates, evaluate Fellow candidates, respond to requests for information or connections with Ashoka staff, and process questionnaire responses submitted by you. We will also use the Personal Data we collect to improve the Site and to ensure the Site’s content is presented in the most effective manner for you and your device; administer the Site, and for internal operations including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes, or to keep the Site safe and secure.</p>

<p>With your consent, we will use your Personal Data to send you information that we think will be relevant to you, including newsletters and marketing information. You may revoke this consent at any time by using any such provided “unsubscribe” link or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ashoka.org">privacy@ashoka.org</a>.</p>

<p>We will share Personal Data with our partners, affiliates, consultants, and providers. Our agreements with these entities require that they keep your Personal Data confidential and only use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not for any other purpose.&nbsp; We also contract other companies and individuals (collectively Service Providers) to perform functions on our behalf:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We use third-party service providers, Click and Pledge and Stipe, to securely process credit card transactions. For more information about Click and Pledge and Stripe’s privacy practices, please see Click and Pledge’s <a href="https://clickandpledge.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> and Stripe’s <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>;</li>
	<li>We use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. For more information about Google Analytics privacy practices, see their <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>;</li>

For more on Jobvite’s privacy practices, see their <a href="https://www.jobvite.com/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>

	<li>if you apply for a position with Ashoka, we will keep your information for a period of time necessary to facilitate the hiring process, provide you with notifications about new positions that match your interest or profile, and in either case not for greater than two (2) years without reconfirming your interest. If you are a successful candidate, will be retained your information as part of your employee file for the duration of your employment plus 6 years following the end of your employment.</li>
</ul>
