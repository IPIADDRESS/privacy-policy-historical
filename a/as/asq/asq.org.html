      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p> The American Society For Quality, Inc. (ASQ), the owner of www.asq.org is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its members, customers and visitors. This privacy policy describes what information ASQ will collect from visitors and purchasers such as yourself, and how we will use that information once it’s collected. This policy does not apply to the practices of any third party, affiliate, or business partner that ASQ does not own or control. </p>
      <p><b>What Web sites does this policy apply to?</b></p>
      <p> This privacy policy applies to ASQ's Web site, www.asq.org. It does not apply to Web sites of any ASQ member, affiliate, section, division, or chapter.

It does not apply to any other Web sites, including those which have hypertext links to the ASQ Web site. </p>
      <p><b>Collection of non-personal data</b></p>
      <p> If you browse ASQ's Web site and you are not an ASQ member, you do so anonymously. We do not collect your e-mail address or other personal information. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. We also track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. </p>

                    </p>
      <p> If you are an ASQ member and log in, we will also collect your first and last name, your membership type, which forums/divisions you are a member of and which publications you are signed up to receive. We do this by placing a small bit of data called a “cookie” on your computer (see more about cookies below). Collecting this information helps us direct you to the information on our Web site that’s meant for you. </p>
      <p><b>Collection of your personal information</b></p>
      <p> Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. We obtain information you provide to us via these forms, as well as surveys and contests, such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by ASQ. In addition, this site uses registration forms for customers to register for courses, conferences, and/or certification exams. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms. </p>
      <p><b>Control of your personal information</b></p>
      <p> ASQ will not sell or share your e-mail address with other organizations. However, other information you share may be used to provide you with information from ASQ or selected organizations about products, services or activities that may be of interest to you. To receive this information you must “opt in” to receive it when you provide personal information on our Web site. </p>
      <p> We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including electronic newsletter delivery and the processing of event registrations. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> If you supply your personal information to an ASQ partner, such as within the ASQ e-Learning Center or the Career Services area, please be aware that ASQ no longer has control over the use of your personal information.&nbsp;We will not knowingly partner with companies that abuse personal information. However, be aware that our partner companies may contact you if you choose to conduct business with them. </p>
      <p><b>Disclosure of your personal information</b></p>
      <p> ASQ may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) satisfy a legal order or comply with legal process; (b) defend the rights of ASQ or its affiliates or business partners; or (c) protect the personal safety of ASQ employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers or Web site users. </p>
      <p><b>Access to your personal information</b></p>
      <p>If you are an ASQ member, you can review and edit your personal information 
        in the "My ASQ" area.&nbsp; Sign in with your member number and 
        password, and click on the Home tab.<br>
        <br>
         Within “My ASQ” you can: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> View and edit the personal information you already have shared with ASQ. </li>
        <li> Change your e-mail address. </li>
        <li> Change your e-mail subscription preferences. </li>
        <li> Change your member password. </li>
        </ul>
      <p> Some services offered on ASQ.org collect information that is not accessible via “My ASQ.” In such cases, you can access your personal information by contacting ASQ as described in the <a href="/contact-asq.html">Contact Us </a>section of the Web site. For example, if you wish to change your ASQ Section membership, you can review and edit your personal information by contacting one of our Customer Care representatives at 800-248-1946 or 414-272-8575.</p>
