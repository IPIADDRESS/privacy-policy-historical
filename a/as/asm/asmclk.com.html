        questions about their use of Your Personal Information. Adscend Media is not responsible for any use of Your Personal Information or any other type of
        Your information when You use such third party sites and services.</p>

      <p>Adscend Media reserves the right to sell, rent or otherwise share some or all of Your Personal Information with other companies or individuals outside
        of Adscend Media if: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You have consented to such sale, rental or sharing; and/or</li>
        <li>Adscend Media becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of all of its assets. In such circumstances, Adscend Media will provide

        party service, information may be shared with the third party and your privacy will be maintained in accordance with the third party privacy
        policy. </p>

      <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY </h2>

      <p>Adscend Media takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
        destruction of its data, including Personal Information stored or maintained on its servers and other systems. These measures include internal reviews
        of Adscend Media's data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
        unauthorized access to servers and systems where Adscend Media stores personal data. </p>

      <h2>DATA INTEGRITY </h2>

      <p>Adscend Media processes Personal Information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Adscend Media
        also takes reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information We process is accurate, complete, and current, but We depend on You and our other
        users to update or correct their Personal Information whenever necessary. </p>

      <h2>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION </h2>

      <p>Except as required by the Terms of Service, You may change the settings of Your Adscend Media account via the "settings" section of such account. You
        may organize or delete certain information through such settings or, alternately, terminate Your Adscend Media account. Adscend Media reserves the right
        to retain archival copies of information that You delete. Adscend will only use Your deleted information for the purposes of detecting and avoiding
        fraud and will share such information with third parties only when We believe that it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to comply with a
        subpoena or other judicial order or process, as otherwise required by law or in order to enforce Adscend Media's Terms of Service. </p>

      <p>When you use the Website, Adscend Media makes good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information. Where applicable, Adscend
        Media asks individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests,
        and Adscend Media may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
        the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access
        is not otherwise required. In any case, where Adscend Media provides information access and correction, Adscend Media provides this service free of
        charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. </p>

        complaints at this address, its policy is to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. Adscend Media will cooperate with the
        appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal
        Information that cannot be resolved between an individual and Adscend Media.</p>

      <h2>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

      <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows users who are California residents to request information about the disclosure of their personal
        information to third parties for direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us by clicking on the link below.</p>

      <h2>YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE GDPR (IF YOU ARE BASED IN THE EU)</h2>
      <p>If you have created an account with us, you can sign into your account to access and update your
      information. You can manage your marketing preferences at any time by opting out of any marketing emails from your account page.</p>
      <p>You have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to
      request access to this information (‘right of access’). You also have the right to be informed of the
      safeguards we have in place relating to any transfers of your information to another country.</p>
      <p>You may ask us, or we may ask you, to rectify information you or we think is inaccurate, and you may
       also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or complete information which is incomplete
       (‘right to rectification’). If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant
       third parties with whom we have shared your data so they may update their own records.</p>
       <p>We want to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. If any of the information
        that you have provided us with changes, for example if you change your email address, name,
        payment details, or if you wish to cancel your registration, please let us know using the contact details
        at the end of this policy.</p>
       <p>You have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes, perhaps for
        another service, without hindering the usability of the data (‘right of portability’). This right does not
        apply where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or
        in the exercise of official authority vested in us.</p>
        <p>You have a right to seek the erasure of your data (often referred to as the ‘right to be forgotten’). You
        may wish to exercise this right for any reason, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to
        continue holding or processing your personal data you may withdraw your consent. You should note
        that we are entitled to and reserve the right to retain your data for statistical purposes. This right is not
        absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information, for example, to comply with our
        legal obligations, or for reasons of public interest.</p>
        <p>You have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information (‘right to restriction’) if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate</li>
          <li>the processing is unlawful and you ask us to restrict use of it instead of erasing it</li>
          <li>we no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish
          or defend legal claims</li>
          <li>you have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the performance of a
          task carried out in the public interest, or for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The
          restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our
          legitimate interests.</li>
          <li>you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information
          for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, protecting the rights of another person
          or for public interest reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have a right to prevent us from processing your data for the purposes of marketing.</p>
