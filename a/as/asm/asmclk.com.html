        questions about their use of Your Personal Information. Adscend Media is not responsible for any use of Your Personal Information or any other type of
        Your information when You use such third party sites and services.</p>

        <li>You have consented to such sale, rental or sharing; and/or</li>
        <li>Adscend Media becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of all of its assets. In such circumstances, Adscend Media will provide

        party service, information may be shared with the third party and your privacy will be maintained in accordance with the third party privacy
        policy. </p>

      <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY </h2>

      <p>Adscend Media takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
        destruction of its data, including Personal Information stored or maintained on its servers and other systems. These measures include internal reviews

        unauthorized access to servers and systems where Adscend Media stores personal data. </p>

      <p>Except as required by the Terms of Service, You may change the settings of Your Adscend Media account via the "settings" section of such account. You
        may organize or delete certain information through such settings or, alternately, terminate Your Adscend Media account. Adscend Media reserves the right
        to retain archival copies of information that You delete. Adscend will only use Your deleted information for the purposes of detecting and avoiding
        fraud and will share such information with third parties only when We believe that it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to comply with a

      <p>When you use the Website, Adscend Media makes good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information. Where applicable, Adscend
        Media asks individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests,
        and Adscend Media may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
        the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access
        is not otherwise required. In any case, where Adscend Media provides information access and correction, Adscend Media provides this service free of
        charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. </p>
