  International and its members and customers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASME International 
  uses third party network advertisers such as [list, e.g., "DoubleClick"] 
  to deliver ads to you on our behalf. We may also use third-party service providers 
  to facilitate some aspects of our Web site services or fulfill your requests. 
  These service providers may be supplied with or have access to your personally 
  identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services 
  to us or on our behalf.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may disclose

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies</b><br>
  Certain parts of ASME.ORG use cookies; a small file placed on your computer, 
  to better enable visitors to use the web site. Generally, cookies enable our 
  server to remember visitors, allow entry into password-protected areas, and 
  to help ensure accurate measuring of web traffic. Cookies can be deleted or 
  rejected by changing the settings on your web browser. However, the deletion 
  or rejection of cookies on a visitor's part may impact your ability to use parts 
  of the ASME.ORG effectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because advertisers 
  or third party web sites may use cookies in different ways, this statement regarding 
  the use of cookies only covers ASME.ORG.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In no way are cookies 
  on the ASME.ORG web site harmful to the machines on which they are placed or 
  how the information is used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Review and Correction</b><br>
  ASME Members may review and update the personally identifiable information that 
  you have provided to ASME International, by logging into <a href="http://members.asme.org">Members

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASME.ORG may display 
  the email addresses of volunteers who serve as officers on ASME International 
  committees and other units. These volunteers are leaders of ASME International 
  and may have chosen to place their contact information online so as to be more 
  accessible to the public. If you are a volunteer or member who has been listed 
  on ASME.ORG and you no longer wish to have your email address posted, please 
  send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@asme.org?subject=Remove Email Address from ASME.ORG">webmaster@asme.org</a> 
  with a subject line of: Remove Email Address from ASME.ORG and the page address 
  where your email is listed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Email Alias 
  Service</b><br>
  ASME International offers its members an email alias. The alias is a simple 
  "store and forward" mechanism that accepts email sent to the alias 
  name and forwards it to the member's actual email address. Once an email alias 
  is issued to a member, ASME International makes no guarantees on the future 
  privacy of the alias. There is no protective or "anti-spam" software 
  on the email alias server; members must take sole responsibility for protecting 
  against publication or misuse of their email aliases. Therefore, members use 
  the email alias service at their own risk. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under no circumstances, 
  including, but not limited to, negligence, will ASME International or its directors, 
  officers, employees, or agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special 
  or consequential damages that result from your use of (or inability to use) 
  the email alias service.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For further explanation 
  of the ASME.ORG email alias, please go to <a href="http://www.asme.org/email">www.asme.org/email</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ASME Forums</b><br>

    impersonate any other user or entity.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will not 
    upload any information, files, code or other materials that contain viruses 
    or are able to disrupt or damage ASME software, hardware or equipment. </font></li>

  your email address to be public in a forum posting, please be sure to select 
  "No" in the area of the screen labeled "Make Email Address viewable 
  to others."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Protection of 
  Children</b><br>
  ASME will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone 
  under 13 years of age, unless it is necessary to respond to a one-time request. 
  Once the request has been answered, ASME will delete the requesting child's 
  personally identifiable information. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Links to Third 
  Parties</b><br>
  ASME.ORG may contain links to third-party web sites and/or content providers 
  that include information or services that may be of interest to you. ASME.ORG 
  also carries banner advertisements that are placed by third-party advertisers. 
  This privacy and security statement applies to the ASME.ORG web site only. This 
  statement does not extend to third-party web sites and/or content providers, 
  including related affiliate web sites and/or content providers such as ASME 
  International's Division, Section or Region Web sites, advertiser web sites, 
  and third-party service providers. ASME International is not responsible for 
  the privacy and security practices of those sites. We recommend that you review 
  the privacy policy at each of these Web sites to determine how that site protects 
  your privacy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b><br>
  ASME International uses online forms on ASME.ORG to collect specific information 
  for event or course registrations, surveys, polls, and other data collection 
  uses. In cases where private information is collected, such as mailing addresses, 
  phone numbers, work location, credit card numbers, etc., all forms are secured 
  through Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption, the most widely accepted and 
  tested form of data encryption. Of course, no transmission over the Internet 
  can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, you provide us with your information 
  at your own risk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  Secure Socket Layer encryption during transmission, ASME takes these additional 
  precautions with your information:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All Web Servers 
    are protected by state of the art, managed firewalls.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data is protected 
    at the server level by IP Address range from ASME offices. This means that 
    only necessary order fulfillment staff, product managers and web server support 
    personnel have access to collected information.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Administrative 
    Screens can only be accessed from ASME offices using Secure Socket Layers.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Credit Card 
    Numbers are encrypted down to the database field level.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASME International 
  cannot ensure that third-party Web sites linked to ASME.ORG, including ASME 
  International's affiliate groups, will provide equivalent security. You should 
  check with the privacy policies of those web sites before submitting any personally 
  identifiable information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Transfer to 
  the United States</b><br>
  If you are located outside of the United States, please note that any personally 
  identifiable information that you provide ASME International will be transferred 
  to the United States. By submitting your personally identifying information 
  to us, you consent to this transfer.</font></p>
