<h2>ASMP’s Privacy Policy</h2>

<p class="intro">ASMP respects the privacy of its members and guests. Whether online or on paper, we collect only the information that is required to deliver the services that you are signing up for, and we are very careful about what we disclose. </p>

<p><strong>Visitors to the ASMP national web site:</strong> We do not require visitors to supply any personal information to access our public content pages. Like most sites, we log all page hits, including visitors’ IP addresses, but this is used only for aggregate statistics, tracing bugs and reporting suspected abuse to the appropriate legal authorities. </p>

<p>From time to time, we may develop web pages that ask for your name, email address or other personal information in order to deliver services to you at a future time. In such cases, we will always disclose how we plan to use your information. If we don’t identify third parties who will see the information, it means that we will not reveal your information to any third parties.</p>

<p><strong>ASMP members:</strong> We require you to give us your postal contact information when you join, so that we can maintain records of membership and financial transactions. You are encouraged to give us your email addresses and website URLs, but are not required to. For General members, a listing in the public Find A Photographer database (<a href="http://www.findaphotographer.org/">www.findaphotographer.org</a>) is a benefit of your membership, and your information will be published unless you choose to suppress it, via checkboxes in your member profile. Likewise, if you sign up for the optional Find A Photo stock image service (<a href="http://www.findaphoto.org/">www.findaphoto.org</a>), your contact information will be published there so that photo buyers can contact you to arrange licensing terms. </p>

<p>We rent our mailing lists to selected vendors whose services and products we judge will be of interest to professional photographers. We supply postal addresses only, and only via bonded mailing houses; we never release email addresses, phone or fax numbers. </p>

<p>Each member has the capability to opt out of these disclosures by clicking a checkbox in the member profile. Each member can inspect and alter his/her own personal info at any time.</p>

<p>To enable the Society’s volunteer operations, the chapter officers and national board officers can view the contact information of their respective members in the national database. The president and membership chairperson of each chapter can also view the dues-payment status of the chapter’s members.</p>

<p><strong>Registrants at seminars:</strong> When you register for an event, we record your name, address, phone and email address. This allows us to verify payment, admit the prepaid attendees at the door and, if needed, contact registrants in the event of late schedule changes. We do not disclose this information to any outside party.</p>

<p><strong>Credit cards:</strong> We accept credit cards via the Internet, as well as by fax and phone. We store the numbers in our system only until the transaction is completed. We don’t store card numbers, even in encrypted form, any longer than necessary. For online transactions, we use SSL encryption to safeguard your information while in transit.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Members must allow cookies from the ‘asmp.org’ and ‘asmpforum.org’ domains in order to access the members-only content of the site, including their personal record in the member database. Cookies are used only to verify that you have successfully logged in, not for tracking what pages are accessed. Outside parties have no access to cookie-based information because we do not use any third-party page-tracking or advertising services.</p>

<p><strong>Chapters:</strong> Each chapter may have its own information gathering system for its members and may operate its own web sites. Chapters are not bound by the national web site’s privacy policy. They are, however, required to keep confidential any private information that they obtain from the national system.</p>

<p><strong>Revisions:</strong> This privacy policy may be changed at any time to conform with applicable laws or to incorporate new online services that ASMP may develop in the future. This page will always have the current version of the policy. </p>

<p><strong>Other points:</strong> Compliance with this privacy policy is not certified by any outside auditor (such as TrustE or BBBonline). ASMP is a New York corporation and so is subject to all laws of the United States, including privacy laws. </p>
