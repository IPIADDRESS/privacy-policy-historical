committed to protecting your privacy, while delivering software that brings you
the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing.
This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices
of Microsoft Web Platform Installer 4.0 (“WebPI”). It focuses on features that
communicate with the Internet. It does not apply to other online or offline
Microsoft sites, products, or services. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:

everything you need for website development. Start from open source web
applications, built-in web templates or just start writing code yourself. It’s
all-inclusive, simple and best of all free. Developing websites has never been
easier.</span></p>

information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled
subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features you are using and provide
the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or
authorized. It may also be used to analyze and improve Microsoft products and
services. In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience
in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one
Microsoft service may be combined with information obtained through other
Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with
information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services
from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based
on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic
area. Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide
will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally
hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as
packaging, sending and delivering purchases and other mailings, answering
customer questions about products or services, processing event registration,
or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those
companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they
are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Microsoft may
access or disclose information about you, including the content of your
communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful
requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or
our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies
governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such
access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft
employees, customers, or the public. We may also disclose personal information
as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of asset.
Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by WebPI may be stored
and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or
its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities.
Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data
from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. </span></p>

software with Internet-enabled features, information about your computer
("standard computer information") is sent to the Web sites you visit
and online services you use. Microsoft uses standard computer information to
provide you Internet-enabled services, to help improve our products and
services, and for statistical analysis. Standard computer information typically
includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, browser
version, and regional and language settings. In some cases, standard computer
information may also include hardware ID, which indicates the device
manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular feature or service sends
information to Microsoft, standard computer information will be sent as well.
The privacy details for each WebPI feature, software or service listed in this
privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it
is used.</span><span style="font-size:9.5pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
