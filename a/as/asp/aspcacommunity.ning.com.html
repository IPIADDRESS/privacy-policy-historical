We have established this Privacy Policy to explain how your Personal Data is collected this Network, and how your Personal Data is used and disclosed by the Network Creator. Any capitalized term not defined in this Privacy Policy has the meaning which we lay out in the <a href="http://aspcacommunity.ning.com/main/authorization/termsOfService?previousUrl=http%3A%2F%2Faspcacommunity.ning.com%2Fmain%2Fauthorization%2FprivacyPolicy%3FpreviousUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Faspcacommunity.ning.com%252F#network">Network Member Agreement</a>.</p>
                        <p><strong>You acknowledge that your Personal Data may be processed by the Network Creator in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be different than the laws in your jurisdiction.</strong></p>

                        <h4>Collection of Information</h4>

                        <h5>Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
                        <p>Once you register with or join this Network using your Ning ID, you are not anonymous to the Network Creator. From that point forward, Ning will share with the Network Creator your account information and Personal Data related to this Network.</p>
                        <p>When registering with the Network, you provide at least your email address, a Member-created password, and the answers to the required profile questions, which might be publicly viewable by other Members or limited to just the Network Creator.</p>

                        <p>You should be aware that other websites visited before visiting the Network might place personally identifiable information within the URL of your browser during a visit to that previous website, and the Network would unintentionally collect that information as part of the referring URL information.</p>
                        <h5>Content and Use of Networks</h5>
                        <p>When you post Content (or send messages) in this or any Social Network(s) on the Ning Platform that enable direct sharing of information with other Members and visitors, other Members and visitors will have access to any Personal Data in such Content. Such Personal Data (which is publicly posted) is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>Because you may voluntarily disclose any Personal Data in these public areas, you should be careful about the information you choose to disclose. The Network Creator does not control that disclosure, and is not liable in any way for anyone's use or misuse of the information in the disclosure. In other words, use caution and judgment here.</p>
