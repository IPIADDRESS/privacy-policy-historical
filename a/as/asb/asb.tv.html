<p align="justify"><strong>We know people rarely read the fine  print, but we thought we’d post it anyway. Without breaking out your  magnifying glass, we’ll zealously guard your personal information and  we’ll never compromise your integrity, or ours. </strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Last Updated: 11.7.08</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>1. Policy</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">Airshowbuzz, LLC ("ASB") has created this privacy policy (the  “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices so that you will understand  when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and  protected with respect to this website (the "Site"). ASB respects the  privacy of its users, and this Policy explains what information we  collect on our Site and how we use such information. Please read this  Policy carefully. In addition, please review the <a href="http://www.airshowbuzz.com/rules.php" target="_blank">Rules of Engagement</a>  posted at the Site, which governs your use of the Site. Your use of our  Site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy  practices, as outlined in this Policy.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>2. Applicability</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">Please note that this Policy only applies to this Site and any other  site owned and/or operated by or for ASB upon which ASB has placed a  "link" which, when "clicked," transfers you to this Policy. This Policy  only covers information collected at this Site, and does not cover any  information collected by any other site unless otherwise specifically  stated or disclosed by ASB.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>3. Information ASB Collects</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">(a) Personally Identifiable Information: Personal Information is  information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally  (such as your first and last name, gender, phone number, address, birth  date, e-mail address, and, if applicable, your credit card  information), which we refer to in this Policy as "PI." Generally, you  may browse our Site without providing us with PI. However, there may be  times when we ask you to provide us with certain PI, such as when you  choose to register with our Site; post a photo, video, or message; or  participate in e-commerce, interactive, or promotional activities. You  can change or update your PI by changing your account information. We  may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or  information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information to  enhance your experience. ASB reserves the right, at any time, to add  features to our Site that require you to register or otherwise provide  additional PI. You can choose not to provide certain information, but  then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of  the Site's features. The PI you submit will be used to carry out your  requests, respond to your inquiries, and to notify you (if applicable)  regarding any promotions or e-commerce activities. Your PI may also be  used by us and any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, joint venturer,  sponsor and/or partner of ASB (collectively, “Affiliated Third  Parties”) to provide you with additional services. You may always  direct us by “opting-out” at the point where we ask for PI, and we will  not share or use PI in order to provide you with additional services.  However, if you do not want us to share this information, we may not be  able to provide you with the additional services. In such case, please  use our unsubscribe page and we will not share such information. We  will not share PI with entities that are not Affiliated Third Parties  unless you give us express permission to do so by opting-in at the  point where we ask for PI. ASB does not sell, rent or share PI  collected with other people other than that specifically outlined  herein.</p>
  <p align="justify">(b) This is not a Site directed to children under the age of 13 and  ASB does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13  years of age at the Site. <strong>If you are  under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to ASB.</strong> If you are under 13 years of age, please do not use the ASB Site—there  are lots of other great websites for you. Talk to your parents about  what sites are appropriate for you.&nbsp; If ASB learns that a child under  the age of 13 has provided the Site with PI, ASB will delete that  child's PI from its system.</p>
  <p align="justify">(c) Anonymous Information: When you visit the Site, our web servers  automatically collect Site usage information. Site usage information is  anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate  our Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each  web page, and the length of their stays. ASB collects the anonymous  information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such as  browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior  and subsequent to visiting our Site, and IP address. We may also  determine what technology is available through your browser in order to  present you the most appropriate version of a web page (i.e. Flash or  HTML).</p>
  <p align="justify">(d) IP Addresses: When visitors request pages from our Site, our  servers log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a  variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report  aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number  of visits to different pages, photos viewed or videos watched on our  Site.</p>
  <p align="justify">(e) Cookies: Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive  by a website when you visit. These files identify your computer and  record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when  you return to the Site, the Site knows who you are and can personalize  your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that  we can determine how to improve the Site by seeing which areas,  features and products are most popular, to personalize the Site and  improve the Site experience. Most browsers automatically accept cookies  as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or  to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by  editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you  will still be able to access those parts of our Site available to the  general public but you may not be able to use some of the Site’s  features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.&nbsp; <br>
    We do not store any PI in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any  information we collect. You may occasionally get cookies from our  advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. We do not  control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy  policy. Visitors to our Site should check the privacy policy of the  advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. You can disable  cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or  options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts  of the Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You  should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have  any questions regarding disabling cookies.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>4. ASB Use and Disclosure of Collected Information</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">(a) ASB: ASB may use your PI to provide the information or content  you have requested. We may also use your PI to contact you regarding  your use of our Site or changes to our Policy or other policy or terms  that affect you and your use of our Site. If you e-mail someone else a  video, photo or other special feature from our Site, we may use the  information you provide about someone else to send that person the  requested e-mail. ASB may use information collected about our users to  improve the Site’s content, design, navigation, or for other internal  purposes such as analyzing aggregate traffic patterns and other trends.</p>
  <p align="justify">(b) Third parties providing services on our behalf: ASB may employ  other trusted companies and individuals to perform functions on our  behalf. Examples may include: </p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="padding-left:20px;"></span>(i) Third parties involved in analyzing data, providing  marketing assistance and providing customer service: These third  parties may have access to our users' PI in order to provide these  services to us on our behalf solely for such purposes.&nbsp; However, they  are not permitted to use PI for any other purpose. </p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="padding-left:20px;"></span>(ii) Third party providers of products and services:&nbsp; We may disclose  PI to third parties so they can inform you about their products or  services. If you do not wish to receive these types of third party  communications, you can click <a href="http://www.airshowbuzz.com/contact.php" target="_blank">here</a> and complete a form to tell us your  preferences. While you may choose not to receive direct marketing  information from third parties, you will continue to receive marketing,  promotional, and other information from ASB.</p>
  <p align="justify">(c) Other Third Parties: ASB does not rent, sell or otherwise  disclose your PI to third parties unless disclosed herein, or at the  time such information is collected, or unless you otherwise give  consent, other than in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="padding-left:20px;"></span>(i) Legal Action: ASB may disclose information about its users,  including PI, when legally required to do so, for example at the  request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to  verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Site and  applicable laws, or to protest against misuse or unauthorized use of  our Site. ASB may also disclose user information whenever we believe  disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability, to protect or  defend our rights or property or protect the safety, rights or property  of our users; </p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="padding-left:20px;"></span>(ii) Corporate Change: ASB may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose  user information, including PI, to a successor entity in connection  with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of all or  substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change  respecting ASB and/or the Site.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>5. Third Party Websites</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">Please be aware that we provide links to third party websites from  the Site as a service to our guests and we are not responsible for the  content, information collection, privacy policies or other use  practices of those sites. Please also note that these websites' privacy  policies will differ from those of ASB. Therefore, we encourage you to  review and understand their privacy practices before providing them  with information.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>6. Security&nbsp; </strong></p>
  <p align="justify">ASB takes reasonable measures to secure the data you submit to us  from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, including limiting the  number of people who have physical access to our user data. When  possible, we will ask any third parties to whom we may transfer such  information to take comparable measures. Unfortunately, no data  transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, ASB cannot and does not ensure or warrant the security of  any information you transmit to ASB, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>7. Consent to Transfer</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the  European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be  aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the  United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services  and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>8. Acceptance/Changes to Policy</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy. ASB  reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Policy at  any time in its sole discretion. We will post any changes here, so be  sure to check back from time to time. We will only use the PI you  provide to the Site in a manner consistent with our current Policy,  unless you give us your consent.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>9. Contact Us</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Policy,  please contact us at info@airshowbuzz.com. Or you can send us mail to:  Airshowbuzz, LLC, 1420 Ambassador St., Los Angeles, CA 90035.</p>
