<!--Introduction-->
<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>This Arizona State University (<b>ASU</b>) Privacy Statement provides information required by Arizona law about ASU’s online information gathering and dissemination practices. Individual pages on ASU websites may provide additional information. </p>
	<p>In addition to the information in this Privacy Statement, <a href="/tou/">ASU’s Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html">Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Information Management Policy</a> set forth requirements that you must follow when using ASU’s websites and technology network. </p>
	<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement because we may update it from time to time. </p>

<!---What services-->
<h3>What Services ASU Provides Online</h3>
	<p>ASU’s websites provide online information and services to all users of ASU’s technology network (<b>Users</b>) consistent with <a href="https://president.asu.edu/about/asucharter">ASU’s Charter and Mission</a>. 
	</p><p>In addition to information and services provided on ASU websites, ASU may also provide connections to external services and information provided by non-ASU service providers. These non-ASU provided services may include the education versions of Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, and Google, which includes Gmail. Non-ASU service providers have their own privacy policies that are not covered by this Privacy Statement. ASU is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of non-ASU service providers. We recommend you review the privacy practices and policies of all non-ASU service providers.</p>

<!--Information Collection -->
<h3>Information ASU Collects from Users and How We Use it</h3>
	<p>ASU collects information actively provided by Users. We may also collect information about the computers, mobile devices, or other devices you use to access ASU’s technology network, such as IP address, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, web pages requested, network software access, referring web pages, date, time, and duration of activity, passwords, and accounts accessed, volume of data storage and transfers, and locations of User devices when connected to ASU’s technology network. Logs of this information may be retained. We may contract with non-ASU service providers to help us better understand Users. These non-ASU service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our services.</p>

	<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computing devices. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about network traffic and network interaction so that we can offer better network experiences and tools in the future. Cookies may be set by an organization other than ASU. These non-ASU cookies may, for example, originate from social media services such as YouTube and Facebook. Because the cookie policies of these services change over time, you should review their policies by visiting the privacy policies of these services directly. Users may disable cookies through their individual browser options. </p>
 
	<p>ASU uses information collected to provide services, in support of ASU’s Charter and Mission, to protect the security of ASU’s technology network, to support academic integrity, and to provide safety and security services to Users, as well as to monitor, preserve, and enhance the use, functioning, and integrity of ASU’s technology network. ASU may also use information collected from you for analysis and statistical purposes consistent with ASU’s Charter and Mission.</p>

<!--Alternatives-->
<h3>Alternatives to Website Transactions</h3>
	<p>If you prefer not to provide information to ASU through our technology network, you may contact the ASU administrative unit responsible for the service to learn about available options.</p>

<!--Disclosure-->
<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
	<p>ASU does not disclose confidential information we collect online to individuals or entities not affiliated with ASU, except in the limited circumstances described below. Non-confidential information may be disclosed or distributed pursuant to federal laws, state laws, including Arizona’s public records laws,  and ASU and Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) policies. These laws and policies explain what information may be shared or disclosed. They also explain what information is protected as confidential.</p>

<!--subDisclosure-->
<p><strong>Student Records.</strong> Certain records of students are protected by the federal <a href="https://students.asu.edu/policies/ferpa">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a>, Arizona law, and ASU Policy. Information about students’ access to their education records and protection of education records is available in ASU’s <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/ssm/ssm107-01.html">Student Services Manual in Section 107-01</a>. This policy also provides information on students’ rights to limit access to their directory information. ASU may disclose confidential student information with the consent of the student, under subpoena or court order, or in other limited circumstances as permitted by FERPA.
</p>
<!--subDisclosure-->
<p><strong>Employee Records.</strong> Access to ASU personnel records is governed by ABOR Policy <a href="http://www.abor.asu.edu/1_the_regents/policymanual/chap6/6-912.pdf">6-912</a>, <a href="https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd811.html">ACD 811</a>, <a href=" https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/policyarchives/SPP/Mar2008/spp1101.html">SPP 1101</a>, and Arizona law.
</p>
<!--subDisclosure-->
<p><strong>Public Records Laws.</strong> ASU may be required to provide access to ASU records to third parties pursuant to Arizona’s public records laws <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/arsDetail/?title=39">ARS §§ 39-121 through 39-161</a>. Additional information about Arizona’s public records laws is available at <a href="https://ogc.asu.edu/public-records/">ogc.asu.edu/public-records/</a>.
</p>
<!--subDisclosure-->
<p><strong>Court Order or Public Safety.</strong> ASU may be required to disclose confidential information pursuant to a valid court order or lawfully issued and served subpoena, search warrant, or other legal order. In addition, ASU may disclose confidential information to law enforcement if ASU believes that disclosure is necessary to protect ASU, to protect the health or safety of individuals, or if law enforcement believes that ASU’s resources have been used in the commission of a crime.</p>

<!--subDisclosure-->
<p><strong>Contractors.</strong> ASU may contract with non-ASU service providers to provide services and information through ASU’s technology network. ASU may provide information, including personal information collected on our technology network; to non-ASU service providers to assist ASU deliver classes, programs, products, information, and services. ASU also contracts with non-ASU service providers to perform analysis, research, and administrative activities for ASU. ASU requires non-ASU service providers to protect personal information on our behalf.
</p>
	<p>ASU does not allow any non-ASU entities to collect information from ASU’s technology network unless those entities have received written permission from an ASU authorized signatory.</p>

<!--Security-->
<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>ASU takes steps to ensure that confidential information collected online is secure. These steps include: ongoing User education; using tools in an effort to restrict unauthorized access, viruses, phishing, and hacking attempts; and monitoring activity to identify potential system threats. ASU routinely assesses and enhances tools and processes available to strengthen our online security.</p>
