					<p>Much of the information that we have about you comes from you. When you perform certain transactions, you may give us information such as your name, address, driver's license, social security number, e-mail address and telephone number. We keep information about the types of services you purchase or otherwise obtain from us and our affiliates. Examples of this include premiums, account balances, and payment history. We also collect information using our websites, including information related to your activity while using our sites and information from online collecting devices known as "cookies" (see below).</p>
					<h4>What are cookies and how are they used? </h4>
					<p><strong>Do you log my activity on your site?</strong> During the period you are logged in to our site, we may log your IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or reviewing our site. </p>
					<p>As part of our services, we also use cookies. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided us with such information (over the Internet or otherwise) or set up preferences in your browser to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address or other personal information. </p>
					<p>In general, cookies allow us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more customized service. We may also use cookies to track and measure customer or user requests, inquiries, preferences, interests, demographics, traffic patterns and Web site usage, and to determine audience size and repeated usage. </p>
