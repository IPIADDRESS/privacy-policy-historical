Asurion uses session and persistent cookies to, among other things, identify Your computer during a particular interaction and analyze Your behavior during a particular visit. Most web browsers provide You with the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If You choose to decline cookies, You may not be able to fully use Asurion’s Sites, Services, or applications.</p></div></div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h5 id="pixels">Pixel Tags</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pixel tags, also known as web beacons, help Asurion better manage user experience and content tracking. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which provide a similar function to cookies and are used to track user interaction with content provided by Asurion or an affiliate organization. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly within content. The small size and transparency of pixel tags are not intended to deceive content recipients, but minimize distraction.</p></div></div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h5 id="thirdparty">Third Party Data Sources</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Asurion may leverage external data sources in order to provide context and background on the users of its Sites, Services, or applications in order to improve customer experience, mitigate fraud or malicious activity, or comply with internal company and external regulatory requirements.</p></div></div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h5 id="notrack">Do Not Track and Third Party Advertising Cookies</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative, http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/, that has developed a technical “flag” or signal that an end-user may be able to activate within their browser software to notify websites that they do not wish to be “tracked” by third parties as defined by the initiative. The initiative, however, has not reached a consensus as to exactly what technical or other actions those parties receiving the signal should take. As a result, Do-Not-Track has not yet been standardized and most websites, including Asurion Sites, do not alter their behavior or change their services when they receive a “do-not-track” flag or signal. You can, however, make decisions about Your privacy and the advertisements You receive. Asurion may utilize online behavioral advertising on the Sites in the future. Some of the ads You receive on Sites are customized based on predictions about Your interests generated from Your visits to different Sites. This type of ad customization is sometimes called “online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising. The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) provides a “Consumer Optout” for certain companies that have agreed to provide that functionality through the DAA.As an alternative to the DAA opt-out, You can also elect to block all cookies from first parties (such as Asurion) and from third parties (such as entities involved in advertising) by using the cookie blocking options built into Your browser software. Please note, however, that if You do decide to block cookies, some parts of Asurion’s sites may not function correctly.</p></div></div><div class="vc_empty_space" style="height: 20px"><span class="vc_empty_space_inner"></span></div><div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element "><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h5 id="retention">RETENTION AND DELETION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Asurion will retain Your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and Your consent to such purposes(s) remains valid with respect to claims data and to file claims related to insurance coverage after termination of Asurion’s relationship with You.
