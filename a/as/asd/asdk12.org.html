		<h2><a name="personalused"></a>How Personal Information is used</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<h3>Email</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you send an email to us, it will be forwarded to those individuals 
					(employees, school board members) necessary to address that email. Email is 
					recognized as written communication and is considered public record. If a 
					request for public information is submitted to the district, any information 
					contained in that email, including the address, could be released.</p>
				<p>If you choose to provide personal information about yourself in that email, we 
					will use the information only to respond properly to your request or to fulfill 
					the stated purpose of the communication. We will not disclose any personal 
					information you decide to provide us, unless disclosure is required by state 
					law or school board policy (<a href="/School_Board/Policy/800policy.asp#823.5">School 
						Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records"</a>). We do not share, 
					disclose or sell email addresses to other organizations.</p>
				<p>Please also keep in mind that email is not necessarily secure against third 
					party interception. If your communication is very sensitive or includes 
					personal information, you may want to contact us by postal mail or telephone 
					instead.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Forms</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you use one of our public comment forms your name, contact information, and 
					comments may be subject to public disclosure. They will be considered written 
					communication and could be released subject to the guidelines outlined in <a href="/School_Board/Policy/800policy.asp#823.5">
						School Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records."</a></p>
				<p>Phone numbers and emails collected through these forms are used only by members 
					of the board and school district employees to respond to your comments. We do 
					not share, disclose or sell email addresses or phone numbers to other 
					organizations.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Email Lists</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The information we collect when you subscribe to one of our email lists is used 
					solely to administer these lists and is not shared, disclosed or sold to other 
					organizations.</p>
			</blockquote></blockquote>
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
		<h2><a name="rules"></a>Rules for Sending Comments</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Board shall not hear any complaints against pupils or District employees 
				unless such complaints have been heard by the superintendent through proper 
				channels, including the Citizens Complaint process. Exceptions to this policy 
				include negotiated agreements, which may have overriding appeals language, and 
				civil or legal appeals, which supersede School Board authority.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p align="right"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>
		<h2><a name="security"></a>Security</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Anchorage School District takes every precaution to protect our user's 
				information. If you are a member of one of our email lists, your subscription 
				information will be stored in a secure database solely for our use in sending 
				the announcements.

			<p>Certain features of the Anchorage School District's web site require that your

				off cookies in your browser, you will not have access to these particular

			</p>
			<p>Currently the only pages that use cookies are the new myASD pages. The cookie is 
				created only if you log in to myASD, and it will not affect your use of 
				anything outside of the myASD pages.
			</p>
			<p>These pages use what is known as a "session cookie" so that the server can keep 
				track of you while you use the myASD service. When you log out of myASD or quit 
				your browser, the cookie is destroyed and nothing permanent is left on your 
				machine. If you go to a different web site without logging out of myASD or 
				without quitting your browser, the myASD session cookie will still be on your 
				machine, but it will not be readable or usable by any other web site.
