<blockquote> 
  <p class="headline">Email</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If you send an email to us, it will be forwarded to those individuals (employees, 
      school board members) necessary to address that email. Email is recognized 
      as written communication and is considered public record. If a request for 
      public information is submitted to the district, any information contained 
      in that email, including the address, could be released.</p>
    <p>If you choose to provide personal information about yourself in that email, 
      we will use the information only to respond properly to your request or 
      to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication. We will not disclose 
      any personal information you decide to provide us, unless disclosure is 
      required by state law or school board policy (<a href="http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/School_Board/Policy/800policy.html#823.5">School 
      Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records"</a>). We do not share, disclose 
      or sell email addresses to other organizations.</p>
    <p>Please also keep in mind that email is not necessarily secure against third 
      party interception. If your communication is very sensitive or includes 
      personal information, you may want to contact us by postal mail or telephone 
      instead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="headline">Forms</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If you use one of our public comment forms your name, contact information, 
      and comments may be subject to public disclosure. They will be considered 
      written communication and could be released subject to the guidelines outlined 
      in <a href="http://www.asd.k12.ak.us/School_Board/Policy/800policy.html#823.5">School 
      Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records."</a></p>
    <p>Phone numbers and emails collected through these forms are used only by 
      members of the board and school district employees to respond to your comments. 
      We do not share, disclose or sell email addresses or phone numbers to other 
      organizations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="headline">Email Lists</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The information we collect when you subscribe to one of our email lists 
      is used solely to administer these lists and is not shared, disclosed or 
      sold to other organizations.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>The Board shall not hear any complaints against pupils or District employees 
    unless such complaints have been heard by the superintendent through proper 
    channels, including the Citizens Complaint process. Exceptions to this policy 
    include negotiated agreements, which may have overriding appeals language, 
    and civil or legal appeals, which supersede School Board authority. </p>

  <p>The Anchorage School District takes every precaution to protect our user's

  <p>These pages use what is known as a "session cookie" so that the server can

    or quit your browser, the cookie is destroyed and nothing permanent is left 
    on your machine. If you go to a different web site without logging out of
