		<h2><a name="personalused"></a>How Personal Information is used</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<h3>E-mail</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you send an e-mail to us, it will be forwarded to those individuals 
					(employees, school board members) necessary to address that e-mail. E-mail is 
					recognized as written communication and is considered public record. If a 
					request for public information is submitted to the district, any information 
					contained in that e-mail, including the address, could be released.</p>
				<p>If you choose to provide personal information about yourself in that e-mail, we 
					will use the information only to respond properly to your request or to fulfill 
					the stated purpose of the communication. We will not disclose any personal 
					information you decide to provide us, unless disclosure is required by state 
					law or school board policy (<a href="/School_Board/Policy/800policy.asp#823.5">School 
						Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records"</a>). We do not share, 
					disclose or sell e-mail addresses to other organizations.</p>
				<p>Please also keep in mind that e-mail is not necessarily secure against third 
					party interception. If your communication is very sensitive or includes 
					personal information, you may want to contact us by postal mail or telephone 
					instead.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Forms</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>If you use one of our public comment forms your name, contact information, and 
					comments may be subject to public disclosure. They will be considered written 
					communication and could be released subject to the guidelines outlined in <a href="/School_Board/Policy/800policy.asp#823.5">
						School Board Policy 823.51 "Availability of Records."</a></p>
				<p>Phone numbers and emails collected through these forms are used only by members 
					of the board and school district employees to respond to your comments. We do 
					not share, disclose or sell e-mail addresses or phone numbers to other 
					organizations.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				<p>The information we collect when you subscribe to one of our e-mail lists is used 
					solely to administer these lists and is not shared, disclosed or sold to other 
					organizations.</p>

		<h2><a name="rules"></a>Rules for Sending Comments</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The Board shall not hear any complaints against pupils or District employees 
				unless such complaints have been heard by the superintendent through proper 
				channels, including the Citizens Complaint process. Exceptions to this policy 
				include negotiated agreements, which may have overriding appeals language, and 
				civil or legal appeals, which supersede School Board authority.
