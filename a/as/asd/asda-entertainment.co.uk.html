		<br>
		A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your device when you visit our sites. When you next visit our sites the cookie allows us to distinguish you from other users.
		</p>
		<p>

		</ol>
		<p id="cookiesWeUse">
		<strong>Cookies we use and why we use them</strong>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Essential cookies</strong>
			<br>
			Essential cookies are technical cookies that are required for the operation of our sites. Without essential cookies our sites can’t operate properly. Essential cookies include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Performance cookies</strong>
			<br>

        <strong>Security</strong> - at ASDA, information security is very important and we have taken many steps to make sure your shopping experience with us is secure. Information about you will be kept safe and secure. 
		In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your information, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect and secure information that is collected online.
	</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Keeping your information secure</strong> - to help us keep your information confidential you should:
        </p>
        <ol>
        	<li>Keep your password secret.</li>
            <li>Never distribute the website addresses for pages that you have looked at while logged in as a registered customer.</li> 
        </ol>
		<p>
        <strong>Password</strong> - you should choose a password that is not obvious or known to anyone else. You should never give a third party your password, as you will be responsible for all activity and charges incurred through use of your password whether authorised by you or not.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you forget your password, you can request a new password, which will be emailed to the address we hold for you. You can change your password anytime through the account facilities on the website. Should we think that there is likely to be, or has been any breach of security, we may change your password and notify you of the change by email.
		</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Payment Card Security</strong> - we use Verisign and the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology to make sure that the details you provide when placing an order are kept private and secure, making shopping on our website safe. Our secure server encrypts your credit or debit card number details along with your personal information and changes them into bits of code that are then securely sent over the internet. Your browser will show when you are in a secure environment by displaying either a locked padlock or an image of a key in the grey bar at the bottom of the page; it may also warn you when you are entering a secured environment as you go to place your order. Once your payment information is received by us, your payment card is processed through the same systems that handle our store sales - so they're tried and tested over many years of secure operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Security in our offices</strong> - access to your information is restricted in our stores and offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store this information are kept in a secure environment.
        </p>
		<p>
        <strong>Purchase Guarantee</strong> - we are so confident about security on our website that when you shop with us we back each of your credit card purchases with a guarantee. In the unlikely event that unauthorised use is made of your credit card, most card issuers either cover all the charges that result from the unauthorised use or may limit your liability to £50. If your credit card issuer holds you liable for any of this £50 we will reimburse you up to the full £50. This guarantee applies where the unauthorised use is as a direct result of giving us your credit card details on our secure server and not through your own fault.
		</p>
		<h2>Mobile Applications</h2>
		<p>
		ASDA's mobile applications may include functionality to allow you to create a shopping list, search or add products to a favourites list using voice input or text, or by scanning bar codes, check price or product availability and print coupons, browse, search and buy ASDA.com products, locate the nearest ASDA store, track orders, find aisle locations for items on your shopping lists, order prescription refills, and view, share and print your online photos.

In addition, our service providers may not use or disclose personal information for any purpose other than providing the services on our behalf. We may also work with analytics companies to help us understand how our mobile applications are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can't identify you personally based on information they collect from our mobile applications or your use of them. These analytics providers may also have access to your device-specific information such as a unique device identifier. This information will not be associated in any way with your account at ASDA or any personal information that identifies who you are, and we require these service providers to keep your information secure.

		</p>

		</p>
