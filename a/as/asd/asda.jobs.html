made (as detailed below).</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>Our aim is to be as clear and open as possible about what we do
with your personal data and how we use it. If you apply for a
position using the online recruitment services, or via your agency,
Asda will receive and use the information you provide (including
personal data) for the recruitment purposes outlined in this
privacy statement.</p>

<h5>What information do we collect and what do we use it for?</h5>

<p>You can have a look through the site without giving us any of
your personal data.<br>
<br>
 If you decide to apply for a position via the site or your agency,
Asda will need to collect and process your personal data,
including:<br>
<br>
 • Name, address and postcode - without this we would not know
where to send recruitment information.<br>
<br>
 • E-mail address - we send a confirmation of your application via
email. We may use e-mail or telephone to advise you of similar
alternative vacancies unless you have asked us not to. We may also
contact you by e-mail if you have only partially completed an
application. Rest assured, we won't bombard you with boring
emails<br>
<br>
 • Contact telephone numbers - if there are any problems with your
application or we need to clarify anything with you, we need to be
able to contact you quickly. Again, we won't pester you.<br>
<br>
 • User name and password - this is to keep your personal data
secure and so that you can return to a partially completed
application at a later date.<br>
<br>
 • Your application - this is required so that we may assess you.
Such personal data will include details of your skills (including
education, professional qualifications and training), employment
history and referees. You should only provide the personal data
required by our application template. This template includes a
question about any adjustments that may be required should you be
invited for interview/assessment.<br>
<br>
 • Disability data - any personal data you provide about a
disability is sensitive personal data. By providing such sensitive
personal data, you agree to allow us to use it for the purposes of
making any necessary adjustments if you are invited for
interview/assessment, and for monitoring purposes.<br>
<br>
 • Criminal records checks - some roles may require us to enquire
about previous criminal convictions or carry out criminal records
checks. If this is necessary we will make you aware of this as
early in the recruitment process as possible.<br>
<br>
 • Other personal data specified during the online application
process that is relevant to recruitment.<br>
<br>
 If your application is successful and we recruit you to work with
Asda, we will also require your National Insurance number (and any
other proof of your right to work in the UK, for example visa or
working permits), bank details, date of birth, next of kin and
driving licence (if applicable).</p>

<h3>Use and disclosure of information</h3>

<p>The personal data you provide will be used to:<br>
<br>
 • Process your application<br>
 • Consider you for the position for which you have applied, and
subsequent suitable vacancies (unless you have opted not to be
contacted in respect of subsequent vacancies)<br>
 • Fulfil Asda's legal obligations<br>
 • Carry out internal record keeping<br>
 • Provide general aggregate information (which does not identify
individuals) and statistics to help Asda develop its websites and
services<br>
 • Make up part of your personnel records if your application is
successful (but only to the extent that such personal data is
relevant to your on-going employment)<br>
 • Approach your nominated referees for the purposes of obtaining
references<br>
 • Carry out equal opportunities monitoring (see below)<br>
<br>
 Please note that we may use service providers to process your
personal data on our behalf but only for the purposes outlined
above.<br>
<br>
 Where you provide personal data about somebody else, for example,
your referees, you should ensure that they have given their
consent.</p>

<h3>IP addresses</h3>

<p>When you visit the site, we may receive your IP address, a
unique identifier for your computer or other access device. We do
not use your IP address to identify you.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Our sites use a number of different cookies. Below we explain
the cookies we use and why we use them.</p>

<h5>What is a cookie?</h5>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your device
when you visit our sites. When you next visit our sites the cookie
allows us to distinguish you from other users.<br>
<br>
 There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>

<p><strong>• Persistent cookies</strong> - Persistent cookies
remain on your device until deleted manually or automatically</p>

<p><strong>• Session cookies</strong> - Session cookies remain on
your device until you close your browser when they are
automatically deleted.</p>

<h5>Cookies we use and why we use them</h5>

<p><strong>• Essential cookies</strong> - Essential cookies are
technical cookies that are required for the operation of our sites.
Without essential cookies our sites can't operate properly.
Essential cookies include, for example, cookies that enable you to
log into secure areas</p>

<p><strong>• Performance cookies</strong> - Performance cookies
allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our sites
and to see how visitors move around them. This helps us to improve
the way our sites work by enabling us to tailor our sites to the
way visitors use them. The information we collect from performance
cookies is aggregated which means that we cannot identify you from
it.</p>

<p><strong>• Experience cookies</strong> - Experience cookies allow
our sites to remember the choices you make. Our sites use
experience cookies to provide you with enhanced and personalised
features. For example, we use information collected through what
are known as "web-analytic" cookies to compare the choices you make
to those of our other customers so that we can learn from those
choices. Information collected by experience cookies cannot track
your browsing activity when you leave our sites to browse other
sites.</p>

<p><strong>• Marketing cookies</strong> - Marketing cookies record
your visits to our sites, the pages you have visited and the links
you have followed. We use this information to make our sites and
the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests.
For example sometimes we use marketing cookies to limit the number
of times that you see an advert. Sometimes we share information
about your browsing activity, (which we have collected from
cookies), with our advertising partners. They may use this
information to advertise products, which may interest you, on other
sites.</p>

<h5>Turning cookies and web beacons off</h5>

<p>You have a choice to accept or reject cookies and web beacons.
You may set up your web browser to notify you of cookie placement
requests or web beacons, or you can choose to reject cookies or web
beacons completely.<br>
 If you want to delete any cookies or web beacons that are already
on your computer or reject future cookies or web beacons, please go
to the instructions for your file management software or look at
www.aboutcookies.org.<br>
 Please remember that if you delete or reject cookies or web
beacons, certain parts of the site may not be available or may not
function properly. If you do not reject cookies or web beacons and
you continue to use the site, you agree to our use of such cookies
and web beacons.</p>

<h3>Equal Opportunities</h3>

<p>We are required by law to make basic documentation checks on
every candidate. Please note that you will be asked to provide
documentation of your eligibility to work in the UK if you are
invited to attend the next stage of the recruitment process with
us. Other personal data, for example, relating to your gender, race
or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age bracket, details of any
disability and sexual orientation is requested for the purpose of
monitoring the effectiveness of our Equal Opportunities policy.
This personal data is requested purely for monitoring purposes.</p>

<h3>International transfers</h3>

<p>In order to carry out the steps set out above we may send your
personal data outside of the European Economic Area and, if
necessary, across international borders. By submitting your
personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing and
processing. The data protection laws in these countries may not be
as comprehensive as in the European Economic Area. However, we will
take appropriate steps to make sure there is an adequate level of
protection for processing personal data in these countries in
accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998.<br>
<br>
 Any details you provide may be electronically sent to the US to
our parent company Walmart Stores, Inc., which helps us in running
our websites. However, any such personal data will be dealt with in
accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<h3>Storage of Data</h3>

<p>We will not store your personal data for any longer than is
necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or as
required by law. However, we may be obliged by law to store your
communications and personal data including activity logs and we may
need to show details of these to government or authorised officials
upon request. Like many websites, we use log files to monitor the
effectiveness of our online marketing programmes.</p>

<h3>Your rights and removal of your personal data</h3>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the personal
data you provide is true and is not misleading, deceptive or
inaccurate in any way. If you believe any of the personal data Asda
holds about you is incorrect, please log back into your account and
amend your record or contact us at Asda Resourcing Team, Asda
House, Great Wilson Street, Leeds, LS11 5AD and we will happily
amend this for you.<br>
 If at any time after the submission of your application you become
unavailable to work, or if you simply change your mind, please
contact the store / depot you have applied to work in and we will
withdraw your application.<br>
<br>
 You have a right to access the personal data held about you. To
obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you, please
contact us at Asda Resourcing Team, Asda House, Great Wilson
Street, Leeds, LS11 5AD.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The transmission of information via the internet is not
completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your
personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
transmitted to the site. Any transmission is at your own
risk.<br>
 Once we receive your personal data, we will use appropriate
technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss,
destruction or damage.<br>
<br>
 Your personal data can only be viewed on-line if you successfully
log-in to the site. Our log-in procedure minimises the risk of
someone who is not the applicant doing this. You are responsible
for keeping your password confidential. We ask you not to share
this password with anyone.</p>

produced by Kenexa Technology, Inc. and/or its partners. The

<h3>No liability for consequential damages</h3>

<p>In no event shall Kenexa or its suppliers be liable for any
damages whatsoever including, without limitation, damages for loss
of vocational opportunity arising out of the use of or inability to
use this Kenexa product, even if Kenexa has been advised about the
possibility of such damages.<br>
