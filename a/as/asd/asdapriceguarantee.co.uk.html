    <b>Privacy</b><br><br>
    Your privacy is really important to us, and we understand how important it is to you. Our aim is to be as clear and 
    open as possible about what we do and why we do it. ASDA is committed to the online privacy of all its users.<br><br>
    This Privacy Policy regulates the use by ASDA and its partner companies of the information you provide when using ASDA 
    websites.  It is to be read together with with the <a id="ctl00_PageContent_TCLink" href="/Administration/Terms-And-Conditions.aspx">terms and conditions</a> of use of the website.<br><br>
    This ASDA website is run by the ASDA group of companies and its partners ("we", "us", "our").<br><br>
    We run this site in order to promote products and services and, where these are provided by our partners, to be the 
    link between our customers and our partners. Our partners may have their own privacy policies which you should also 
    look at.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Information We Collect</b><br><br>
    To be able to claim your voucher from us, we have to collect certain information from you.  As part of this, you will 
    need to give your contact information. We use the information given to us by you to provide the service you request 
    from us in the way that is set out in this privacy policy. You can change your registration details easily through the 
    account facilities available on the website or by getting in touch with our Data Protection Officer at the following 
    address: <a href="mailto:dataprotection@asda.co.uk">dataprotection@asda.co.uk</a>.<br><br>
    <b>User name and password</b> – if we collect a user name and password, this is so we can keep your information safe 
    and so that we can have your information to hand each time you visit us.<br><br>
    <b>Name, address and postcode</b> - We use postcodes to quickly get your full address to save you typing it out, in 
    some cases to identify whether we deliver or offer services in your area, and to identify how many claims you have 
    made each month.<br><br>
    <b>Email address</b> - we send a confirmation of your claim via email.<br><br>
    <b>Telephone numbers</b> - if there are any problems with your claim or we need to check anything, we need to be able 
    to contact you quickly.<br><br>
    <b>Payment card number, expiry date, issue no and name of card holder</b> – when you purchase a product or service we 
    need these details so we can collect payment in the same way as when we take payment in a store via chip and pin.<br><br>
    <b>Where you heard about us</b> – we may ask you this to help make our marketing more efficient.<br><br>
    <b>Correspondence</b> – if you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence.<br><br>
    <b>Sensitive personal data</b> - sensitive personal data includes, for example, information related to your health, 
    race or ethnic origin or religion.   We may need sensitive personal data from you for certain products and services, 
    and in some cases, we may be able to assume sensitive personal data about you from the information you provide.  By 
    letting us have any sensitive personal data, you expressly consent to us using and telling others about any of your 
    sensitive personal data so we can provide you with the goods or services requested by you in the way set out in this 
    Privacy Policy.<br><br>
    <b>Third party information</b> - if you give us information about another person, (for example if someone else is 
    taking delivery for you or is included in the purchase of a product) you confirm that you have identified ASDA to them 
    and told them what we will use their information for, as set out in this Privacy Policy and that they have given 
    permission for us to be able to use their personal information in the manner described.  Their personal information will 
    be used to make sure that the delivery is performed correctly, to get in touch with them (if we need to) and to respond 
    to any communications from them.  They will not be sent marketing information unless  they become a customer and provide 
    us with any necessary consents.<br><br>
    <b>IP addresses</b> - when you visit our site, we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier 
    for your computer or other access device.<br><br>
    You may also provide us with personal information if you contact customer services, if you enter promotions or 
    competitions run by us or if you get in touch with us in some other way, for example by way of an email facility 
    provided on the website.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>How We Use the Information We Collect</b><br><br>
    Our main uses of your information are explained above which in general is to process your claim, as well as to help us 
    understand your needs and provide you with a better service. Your account may be used to store information about your 
    previous purchases, personal preferences and shopping lists. But you should also be aware of the following uses –<br><br>
    <b>Marketing</b> – we (including our group companies and partners) and carefully selected third parties may use the 
    information we collect to inform you, by letter, phone, SMS or email, about special offers and new products and services 
    that we think may be of interest to you and we may tell you about other organisations' products and services. We will 
    tell you about this when we collect your information and if you do not wish to receive these communications, please let 
    us know where requested.  You can change your mind at any time by going to the account facilities available on the 
    website or by contacting our Data Protection Officer at the address below. You can also unsubscribe following the 
    instructions that we will include in any communication, such as email or text, we send to you.<br><br>
    <b>Customer care and correspondence</b> - as part of our customer care procedures, we may follow-up, either by letter, 
    phone, SMS or email, customers who have purchased goods or services from our website, have made a claim or who have 
    posted comments about ASDA on the internet, for example to resolve a complaint or to ask for a testimonial.<br><br>
    <b>Market research</b> - from time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. 
    We may contact you by letter, phone, SMS or email.<br><br>
    <b>Personalise shopping</b> - we may personalise your experience by using your past purchases and browsing habits to 
    present special offers and new products and services that we think may be of interest to you. As technology develops this 
    will really help us to improve our service to you.<br><br>
    <b>Website improvement</b> - to help us design our website and improve your experience, we may collect information about 
    the way you use and access our website.  Our web system collects information about each visitor, including IP address, 
    the length of time spent on the website and the order in which pages are visited. We may employ third party experts to 
    help us look at this information.  However, we make sure that anyone we employ treats all information with the same 
    sensitivity and security that we treat it.  This is explained in more detail in the cookies section below.<br><br>
    <b>Fraud Prevention</b> - in order to protect our customers and us from fraud and theft, we may look at the information 
    that we get from making identity checks and other information in our customer records, including how you conduct your 
    account, and may pass this to other group companies, other retailers and to financial and other organisations (including 
    law enforcement agencies) involved in fraud prevention and detection, to use in the same way.  When you apply for 
    products or services through our website you may also need to go through a more detailed credit check on terms which we 
    will tell you about first.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Cookies</b><br><br>
    A cookie is a small piece of text that a website may place on your computer's hard drive.<br><br>
    We use cookies to:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>operate online ordering (cookies are needed to browse, apply and purchase);</li>
        <li>greet you personally and speed up your log-in when you come back to the site and to remember your 
        previous orders;</li>
        <li>help us look at web traffic to allow us to improve your experience; and</li>
        <li>make sure of the security and authenticity of registered users.</li>
    </ul>
    You may set up your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely (although 
    declining them may prevent you from being able to use the website properly or at all). How to do this is explained 
    below.<br><br>
    We may look at cookies stored on your computer when you visit our website in future or when you open an email from us.  
    We are able to do this by including web beacons (also known as clear GIFS or web bugs) in our emails and on our 
    website.  Our web beacons do not store information on your computer but, by speaking with our cookies on your computer, 
    they can tell us when you have opened emails from us and what pages you look at.<br><br>
    We may also use third party web analytics services (for example Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service 
    provided by Google, Inc.) to help us look at how users use the site.  The service provider may be based outside the 
    UK but your information will only be used for the purpose of looking at your use of our website, putting together 
    reports on website activity and providing other services connected with website activity and internet usage.  The 
    service provider may also let third parties have this information where required to do so by law, or where such third 
    party provides the information on the service provider's behalf.  The service provider will not associate your IP address 
    with any other data held by them.<br><br>
    If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use our audio or video players, the web 
    analytics service may try to store some additional data on your computer.  This data is known as a Local Shared Object 
    or Flash cookie.  This helps us look at the popularity of our media files.  We can count the total number of times 
    each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through. 
    Adobe's website explains how to control Flash cookies on your computer.<br><br>
    <b>Turning cookies and web beacons off</b> - If you want to delete any cookies or web beacons that are already on your 
    computer or stop future cookies or web beacons, please go to the instructions for your file management software or look 
    at <a href="http://www.AboutCookies.org/">www.AboutCookies.org</a>.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Who We Share the Information With</b><br><br>
    We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties other than our subsidiaries, affiliates 
    or parent companies unless you say we can (for example for carefully selected third parties to contact you) or are 
    required by law. We may disclose your information to process and fulfil your order, to provide services you request, 
    for internal business analysis purposes, for the purposes of fraud prevention or if ASDA itself, or any of our business 
    is bought or sold.<br><br>
    <b>Market Research</b> - we may provide information at an aggregated statistical level about our customers, sales, 
    traffic patterns and related site information to third parties, but this information will not identify individuals.<br><br>
    <b>Processing by third parties</b> - from time to time we may employ other companies and individuals to perform 
    functions on our behalf. Examples include completing orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, 
    removing repetitive information from customer lists, confirming contact details, looking at information, providing 
    marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card 
    payments and providing customer service (such as through our call centre staff in the UK or South Africa). They have 
    access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. They must also 
    process the personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.<br><br>
    <b>International transfers</b> - in order to carry out the steps set out above we may send your personal information 
    outside of the European Economic Area and, if necessary, across international borders. The data protection laws in 
    these countries may not be as comprehensive as in the European Economic Area. However, we have taken appropriate steps 
    to make sure the same level of protection for the processing carried out in these countries as within the European 
    Economic Area.<br><br>
    Any details you provide may be electronically sent to the US to our parent company Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which helps 
    us in running our websites. However, any such information will be dealt with in accordance with the UK's Data Protection 
    Act.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Storage of Data</b><br><br>
    We will not store your personal information for any longer than we need to, however we may be obliged by law to store 
    your communications and personal information including activity logs and we may need to show details of these to 
    government or authorised officials upon request. Like many websites, we use log files to monitor the effectiveness of 
    our online marketing programmes.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Access Rights</b><br><br>
    You have a right to access the personal information that is held about you. To obtain a copy of the personal 
    information ASDA holds about you, please write to us at the following address enclosing your postal details and a 
    cheque for £10, which we are entitled by law to charge, payable to ASDA Stores Limited:<br><br>

    <b>Security</b> - at ASDA, information security is very important and we have taken many steps to make sure your shopping 
    experience with us is secure. Information about you will be kept safe and secure.<br><br>
    In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your information, we have put in place suitable physical, 
    electronic and managerial procedures to protect and secure information that is collected online.<br><br>
    <b>Keeping your information secure</b> - to help us keep your information confidential you should keep any password 
    secret.<br><br>
    Never distribute the website addresses for pages that you have looked at while logged in as a registered customer.<br><br>
    <b>Password</b> – where required, you should choose a password that is not obvious or known to anyone else. You should 
    never give a third party your password, as you will be responsible for all activity and charges incurred through use 
    of your password whether authorised by you or not.<br><br>
    If you forget your password, you can request a new password, which will be emailed to the address we hold for you. You 
    can change your password anytime through the account facilities on the website.  Should we think that there is likely 
    to be, or has been any breach of security, we may change your password and notify you of the change by email.<br><br>
    <b>Security in our offices</b> - access to your information is restricted in our stores and offices. Only employees who 
    need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers 
    that store this information are kept in a secure environment.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Links</b><br><br>
    Our website may contain links to let you visit other websites of interest easily. Once you have used these links to 
    leave our website, you should be aware that we do not have any control over that other website. As such we cannot be 
    responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting these websites, and they 
    are not governed by this Privacy Policy. ASDA is not responsible for any products and/or services featured on any third 
    party website. You should exercise caution and look at the Privacy Policy applicable to the website in question.<br><br><br>
    
    <b>Notification of Changes to This Policy</b><br><br>
    If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post these changes on this website so you know what information we 
    collect and how we use it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a way different from 
    that told to you at the time it was collected, we will tell you. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your 
    information in this different manner.<br><br>
