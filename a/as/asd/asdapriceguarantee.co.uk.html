            Our Privacy Mission Statement:</h4>
        "At ASDA, we value the trust placed in us by customers, suppliers and colleagues
        who give us their personal data. Data security is one of our highest priorities
        and we aim to be as clear as possible about what we do with personal data and why
        we do it."
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Our Privacy Statement for ASDA websites</h4>
        Your privacy is really important to us, and we understand how important it is to
        you. Our aim is to be as clear and open as possible about what we do and why we
        do it. ASDA is committed to the online privacy of all its users.
        <br>
        <br>
        This Privacy Policy regulates the use by ASDA and its partner companies of the information
        you provide when using ASDA websites.
        <br>
        <br>
        This ASDA website is run by the ASDA group of companies ("<b>we</b>", "<b>us</b>",
        "<b>our</b>") and our carefully selected partners ("<b>Partners</b>"). We run this
        site in order to promote products and services and, where these are provided by
        our Partners, to be the link between our customers and our Partners.
        <br>
        <br>
        Where we talk about an order in this policy, this can mean an order for goods or
        services, registration on a site, an application for a quotation or application
        for a product or service or the opening of an account.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Information We Collect</h4>
        To be able to order from us we have to collect certain information from you. As
        part of this, you will need to give your contact information. We use the information
        given to us by you to provide the service you request from us in the way that is
        set out in this privacy policy. You can change your registration details easily
        through the account facilities available on the website.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>User name and password</b> - If we collect a user name and password, this is
        so we can keep your information safe and so that we can have your information to
        hand each time you visit us.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Name, address and postcode</b> - Without this we won't know where to send your
        order or to whom. We also use postcodes to quickly get your full address to save
        you typing it out, and in some cases to identify whether we deliver or offer services
        in your area.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Age / date of birth</b> – we may need to collect your age or date of birth in
        order to be able to offer you certain products, such as insurance, financial services
        products or alcohol, and we may also use this to send you age or birthday related
        offers if you agree.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Email address</b> - we send a confirmation of your orders via email which may
        include delivery details, order tracking and our customer services details, in case
        you need to contact us about your order.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Telephone numbers</b> - if there are any problems with your order or we need
        to check anything, we need to be able to contact you quickly.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Payment card number, expiry date, issue no and name of card holder</b> – when
        you purchase a product or service we need these details so we can collect payment
        in the same way as when we take payment in a store via chip and pin.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Where you heard about us</b> – we may ask you this to help make our marketing
        more efficient.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Correspondence</b> – if you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sensitive personal data</b> - sensitive personal data includes, for example,
        information related to your health, race or ethnic origin or religion. We may need
        sensitive personal data from you for certain products and services, and in some
        cases, we may be able to assume sensitive personal data about you from the information
        you provide. By letting us have any sensitive personal data, you expressly consent
        to us using and telling others about any of your sensitive personal data so we can
        provide you with the goods or services requested by you in the way set out in this
        Privacy Policy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Third party information</b> - if you give us information about another person
        (for example if someone else is taking delivery for you or is included in the purchase
        of a product) you confirm that you have identified ASDA to them and told them what
        we will use their information for, as set out in this Privacy Policy and that they
        have given permission for us to be able to use their personal information in the
        manner described. Their personal information will be used to make sure that the
        delivery is performed correctly, to get in touch with them (if we need to) and to
        respond to any communications from them. They will not be sent marketing information
        unless they become a customer and provide us with any necessary consents.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>IP addresses</b> - when you visit our site, we will automatically receive your
        IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.
        <br>
        <br>
        You may also provide us with personal information if you contact customer services,
        if you enter promotions or competitions run by us or if you get in touch with us
        in some other way, for example by way of an email facility provided on the website.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>

        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Website improvement </b>- to help us design our website and improve your experience,
        we may collect information about the way you use and access our website. Our web

        <h4>
            Cookies</h4>
        Our sites use a number of different cookies. Below we explain the cookies we use
        and why we use them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><u>What is a cookie?</u></b><br>
        A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your device when you visit our
        sites. When you next visit our sites the cookie allows us to distinguish you from
        other users.<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>There are two broad categories of cookies: </u></b>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Persistent cookies </b>Persistent cookies remain on your device until deleted
                manually or automatically. </li>
            <li><b>Session cookies</b> Session cookies remain on your device until you close your
                browser when they are automatically deleted. </li>
        </ol>
        <b><u>Cookies we use and why we use them</u></b><br>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Essential cookies</b> Essential cookies are technical cookies that are required
                for the operation of our sites. Without essential cookies our sites can’t operate
                properly. Essential cookies include, for example, cookies that enable you to log
                into secure areas. </li>
            <li><b>Performance cookies</b> Performance cookies allow us to recognise and count the
                number of visitors to our sites and to see how visitors move around them. This helps
                us to improve the way our sites work by enabling us to tailor our sites to the way
                visitors use them. The information we collect from performance cookies is aggregated
                which means that we cannot identify you from it. </li>
            <li><b>Experience cookies </b>Experience cookies allow our sites to remember the choices
                you make. Our sites use experience cookies to provide you with enhanced and personalised
                features. For example, we use information collected through what are known as “web-analytic”
                cookies to compare the choices you make to those of our other customers so that
                we can learn from those choices. Information collected by experience cookies cannot
                track your browsing activity when you leave our sites to browse other sites.
            </li>
            <li><b>Marketing cookies</b> Marketing cookies record your visits to our sites, the pages you
                have visited and the links you have followed. We use this information to make our
                sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. For
                example sometimes we use marketing cookies to limit the number of times that you
                see an advert. Sometimes we share information about your browsing activity, (which
                we have collected from cookies), with our advertising partners. They may use this
                information to advertise products, which may interest you, on other sites. </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <b><u>Your right to refuse cookies and what happens if you refuse them</u></b><br> You can
        refuse cookies by activating the relevant setting on your browser. However, if you
        do so you may not be able to access all or parts of our sites. If you carry on using
        our sites and do not change your browser settings we will assume you consent to
        us using cookies as described above.
        <h4>
            Who We Share The Information With</h4>
        We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties
        (other than our Partners) unless you say we can or are required by law. We may need
        to disclose your information to process and fulfil your order, to provide services
        you request, for internal business analysis purposes, for marketing, for the purposes
        of fraud prevention, or if ASDA itself, or any of our business is bought or sold.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Market Research</b> - we may provide information at an aggregated statistical
        level about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information
        to third parties, but this information will not identify individuals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Processing by third parties</b> - from time to time we may employ other companies
        and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include completing
        orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail, e-mail or SMS messages, removing
        repetitive information from customer lists, confirming contact details, looking
        at information, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links
        (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing
        customer service (such as through our call centre staff in the UK or South Africa).
        They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
        may not use it for other purposes. They must also process the personal information
        as set out in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>International transfers</b> - in order to carry out the steps set out above we
        may send your personal information outside of the European Economic Area and, if
        necessary, across international borders. The data protection laws in these countries
        may not be as comprehensive as in the European Economic Area. However, we have taken
        appropriate steps to make sure there is the same level of protection for the processing
        carried out in these countries as within the European Economic Area.
        <br>
        <br>
        Any details you provide may be electronically sent to the US to our parent company
        Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which helps us in running our websites. However, any such
        information will be dealt with in accordance with the UK’s Data Protection Act.
        <br>
        <br>
        </a>
        <h4>
            Storage of Data</h4>
        We will not store your personal information for any longer than we need to, however
        we may be obliged by law to store your communications and personal information including
        activity logs and we may need to show details of these to government or authorised
        officials upon request. Like many websites, we use log files to monitor the effectiveness
        of our online marketing programmes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Access Rights</h4>

        a copy of the personal information ASDA holds about you, please write to us at the

            <li>You should choose a password that is not obvious or known to anyone else. You should
                never give a third party your password, as you will be responsible for all activity

            <li>If you forget your password, you can request a new password, which will be emailed
                to the address we hold for you. You can change your password anytime through the
                account facilities on the website. Should we think that there is likely to be, or
                has been any breach of security, we may change your password and notify you of the
                change by email. </li>

        <b>Payment Card Security</b> - we use Verisign, 3DS and the latest SSL (Secure Sockets
        Layer) technology to make sure that the details you provide when placing an order
        are kept private and secure, making shopping on our website safe. Our secure server
        encrypts your credit or debit card number details along with your personal information
        and changes them into bits of code that are then securely sent over the internet.
        Your browser will show when you are in a secure environment by displaying either
        a locked padlock or an image of a key in the grey bar at the bottom of the page;
        it may also warn you when you are entering a secured environment as you go to place
        your order. Once your payment information is received by us, your payment card is
        processed through the same systems that handle our store sales - so they're tried
        and tested over many years of secure operation. <b>Security in our offices</b> -
        access to your information is restricted in our stores and offices. Only employees
        who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally
        identifiable information. The servers that store this information are kept in a
        secure environment.
