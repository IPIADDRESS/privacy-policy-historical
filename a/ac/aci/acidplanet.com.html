	<p>This privacy statement is applicable to sonicfoundry.com, acidplanet.com, and any other site that Sonic Foundry owns and operates. </p>
<div><b>Children Under 13</b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry does not intend to collect any personal information from anyone under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, you should not enter any personally identifiable information about yourself on any Sonic Foundry web site and should ask a parent to do so for you. If you are under 13, Sonic Foundry must have express written permission from a parent before you may provide us with any information about yourself. The authorizing parent must email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@sonicfoundry.com?subject=Under 13 Permission">customerservice@sonicfoundry.com</a> certifying the parent's age and authority, and giving us express permission to acquire and retain any such personal information from you as we may normally obtain from users of any of our sites.</div>
<p></p>
<div><b>Information Collection </b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry does not collect personally identifiable information about you on any of our websites except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. For example, we might ask for such information when we run a contest, when you register for subscription services, during product registration, in our online stores, and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards), surveys, and voting and polling activities. Sonic Foundry will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Sonic Foundry cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you provide such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.<div>
<p></p>
<div><b>Information Sharing </b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry may from time to time share or provide your identifiable contact information to third parties, including successors in interest, who may offer you related goods and services, unless you indicate that you would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services, and offerings from these companies. You may opt out at anytime from receiving promotional material from these third parties on a going-forward basis by contacting <a href="mailto:mailpref@sonicfoundry.com">Sonic Foundry list maintenance</a>. </div>
<p>Sonic Foundry may also retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information to create and distribute mailings or e-mail offerings by Sonic Foundry or third parties. In those situations, the outside party is performing work for Sonic Foundry. Sonic Foundry takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your information is used only to provide the promotion or services requested.</p>
<p>Sonic Foundry may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Sonic Foundry's rights or property, other Sonic Foundry users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Sonic Foundry may  also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<div><b>Information Use</b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry may use your identifiable contact information to send you promotional and/or marketing information about products, services and offerings from Sonic Foundry unless you indicate you would like to "opt out" of receiving such materials. You can opt out at anytime by contacting <a href="mailto:mailpref@sonicfoundry.com">Sonic Foundry list maintenance</a>.</div>
<p>However, even if you opt out of receiving any communications from Sonic Foundry, we reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status, changes to the subscriber agreement, and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you.</p>
<p>Sonic Foundry reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics, either internally or by sending this data to a third party for further analysis. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of our Web sites and to create tailored marketing offerings. We may share this information with advertisers. We may also use this information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and how many have clicked on them. Sonic Foundry will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to advertisers; advertisers will not be able to identify any individual from these analyses.</p>
<p>Also, you should be aware that Sonic Foundry may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a Sonic Foundry site. Sonic Foundry is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties, and you should check the applicable privacy policy of any third party when providing personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Sonic Foundry collects IP addresses for system administration, record keeping, and advertising reporting. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Sonic Foundry's servers record incoming IP addresses. The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer's IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to Sonic Foundry. (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)</p>
<p>You should be very cautious when you voluntarily disclose personal information (for example, name or e-mail address) on bulletin boards, in chat areas, or the upload areas of any Sonic Foundry site. That information, along with any other information you may disclose in your posting, can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Sonic Foundry.</p>
<div><b>Cookies</b></div>
<div>You should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Sonic Foundry's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Web site can use to recognize repeat users. Sonic Foundry uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to registered areas of our Web sites. With cookies enabled, you will not need to fill in password or contact information, should areas of our sites ask for this information.</div>
<p>Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our sites. Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site and target advertising. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.</p>
<p>Sonic Foundry does not use cookies to uniquely identify you, except where such use helps us to make your visit more efficient. For example, cookies will help us identify you when you order, so that you don't have to fill in your billing and shipping information every time you visit a Sonic Foundry store. By enabling cookies, you will not have to fill in your personal information every time you post a song to acidplanet.com. Cookies help you travel through our sites efficiently.</p>
<p>Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. Sometimes, advertisers or third parties hosting data for Sonic Foundry will issue cookies. Sonic Foundry cannot control the use of these cookies or the information that they gather.</p>
<p>You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. Remember, though, cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features available on Sonic Foundry's sites. Some areas of our sites may not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our sites.</p>
<div><b>Other Data Requirements </b></div>
<div>Some Sonic Foundry applications generate a Computer ID value during the installation process. This is a number that serves to identify your computer for licensing purposes only and contains no specific information about you, your computer, or any files or other data on your system. Computer ID values serve as an effective way to combat software piracy.</div>
<p></p>
<div><b>Opting Out </b></div>
<div>Upon request, Sonic Foundry will allow any user to opt out of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Sonic Foundry will use reasonable efforts to allow you to update or correct personal information to the extent that changing the data will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon your request, Sonic Foundry will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete you and your personal information from our database; however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some residual data because of backups and records of deletions. Furthermore, your e-mail address will be added to a suppression list that stops any message directed to you before it leaves Sonic Foundry. It is your responsibility, however, to make certain that we have your most current e-mail address.</div>
<p>Should you wish to opt out of any mailing from Sonic Foundry or a mailing you received through information provided to a third party affiliate, please contact <a href="mailto:mailpref@sonicfoundry.com">Sonic Foundry list maintenance</a>. </p>
<div><b>Links to Other Sites</b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry may from time to time offer links to other sites from sites within the Sonic Foundry domain. Sonic Foundry has no control over these external sites or their content, and cannot be held responsible for any actions they may take or any information they might collect. You may arrive at one of these sites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement, or simply by selecting a link on a Sonic Foundry web page. These sites might issue their own cookies or collect data or personal information. Use caution when visiting an external site.</div>
<p></p>
<div><b>Sonic Foundry Security Policy</b></div>
<div>Sonic Foundry is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only as much data as is required to make your Internet and/or product use experience as efficient and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as possible.</div>
<p></p>
<p>The foregoing policies are effective as of November 14, 2001. Sonic Foundry reserves the right to change this policy at any time. By using our sites, you signify your assent to the Sonic Foundry Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Sonic Foundry sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
