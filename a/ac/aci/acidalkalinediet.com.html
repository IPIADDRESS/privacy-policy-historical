          <p class="normal">Our privacy policy is simple.</p>
          <p>We do not share your personal information with any other organizations
            or individuals. We keep all information you provide to us, no matter
            how or why you provide it (ex., becoming an affiliate, ordering our
            products, etc.) completely confidential, and use it only for the
            purpose that you intended (ex., sending you your post order receipt).</p>
          <p>Only those employees with relevant business duties (ex., support
            staff) may access personal information, and only to perform their
            duties. They are subject to dismissal for any privacy violation.</p>
          <p>We promise never to provide any information about our subscribers,
            customers or affiliates to any third party, except of course in the
            unusual event should we be required to do so by law.</p>
          <p>We do use cookies, but only to facilitate tracking of the order
            fulfillment processes. We do not collect or combine any information
            that you provide to us with any other demographic information from
            any other sources. We do not use third party tracking services such
            as DoubleClick. In other words, we have no way of knowing that you
            are you. Your visit is entirely private and anonymous.</p>          
          <p>Please contact our customer support line at <a href="mailto:support@acidalkalinediet.com">support@acidalkalinediet.com</a>            for
            assistance. If applicable, please include <strong>your ClickBank

            your email subject. </p>
