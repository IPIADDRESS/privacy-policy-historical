<h1>Privacy Policy </h1> 

<p>
  Acorn Direct and the Acorn catalog, as well as Acorn Media  Group, Inc. and its affiliated companies (hereafter referred to as Acorn) is  committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate  protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with  us (the phrases "personally identifiable information" or  "personal information" mean any information by which you can be  identified, such as your name, address, telephone number, etc.). The purpose of  this privacy policy is to inform you what personally identifiable information  or personal information we may collect from you when you visit our web site,  how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and  your ability to review and correct, the information. Your use of this website or any  Acorn service constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other  applicable terms. As a part of our commitment to your privacy, Acorn supports  and generally adheres to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct  Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." We  have agreed to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of  information rental, sale or exchange with other marketers; (2) honor customers'  requests not to share their information with other marketers; and (3) honor  customers' requests not to receive mail, telephone or other solicitations from Acorn.
</p>

<h2>Collecting  Information About You</h2>
<p>
  In general, you can visit many of our web pages without  telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We  may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze  this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain  anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. There may be times (such as when you order a product,  subscribe to a service, register to receive catalogs, or to participate in  contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) at which we ask you to provide  certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing  address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, birth date,  gender, occupation, personal interests, etc. We also maintain a record of your  online product purchases. Whether or not to provide such information is  completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we  request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services,  offers and content on our web site.
</p>

<h2>Using Information  About You</h2>
<p>
  We use the personally identifiable information you provide  for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription  or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new  products, services and offers, etc. From time to time we might establish a  business relationship with other persons or entities we deem trustworthy and  whose privacy policies are consistent with ours. These are known as our Select  Partners. In such cases we might share information, including personally  identifiable information about you, that will enable such persons or entities  to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. To serve you better, we may combine information you give us  online or through our catalogs. We use that combined information to enhance and  personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you by  mail about our products and events that may be of interest to you. In certain instances we may disclose your personally  identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to  identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be  causing injury to you, to Acorn or to others. Acorn may also disclose your  personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it.
</p>

<h2>Editing, Updating,  Correcting and Deleting Information About You</h2>
<p>
  We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear  from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us or from our Select  Partners please let us know by calling us at 1-888-870-8047 or by sending us an  email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@acornonline.com">customerservice@acornonline.com</a>.  Please be sure to include your email address, full name, and specifically what  information you do not want to receive. If you would like to update or correct  your email address, street address or other personal information with us please  contact us the same way.
  Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 6-8  weeks to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from postal  mailings. In addition, when you purchase from us online or through our catalogs  we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail to address questions  specific to your order, even if you have opted to not receive communications.
  Please remember, if you delete certain information you may  not be able to continue to purchase products or access other portions of our  web site without entering additional information.
</p>

<h2>Protecting Children</h2>
<p>
  We at Acorn take special care to protect the safety and  privacy of children. Our web site is a general audience site. We do not permit  children under the age of 18 to purchase products on our web site nor do we permit anyone under the age of 13 to register with us. We also do not send  email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13.
  Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents  or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to anyone  online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online  activities and use parental control or other web filtering technology to  supervise children's access to the web.

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
  Our web site may use "cookies" in some instances (also known as web beacons  or web bugs), or similar technology. A cookie is a small amount of data  that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's  hard drive. We may use cookies, or other similar technology as it develops, to  remind us of who you are, tailor our products and services to suit your  personal interests, estimate our audience size, process your order, track your  status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyzing your  visiting patterns. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a  cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You should refer to your browser instructions or  "Help" screen to learn more about how to manage cookies.

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
  We use commercially reasonable encryption and authentication  tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with  us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your  personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any  information you transmit to or from our web site, and you do so at your own  risk. We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to  divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your  browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others  cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with  someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or  Internet cafe.
</p>

<h2>Links to Third Party  Sites</h2>
<p>
  Our web site may contain links to web sites operated and  maintained by third parties. In addition, such third party sites may reference, advertise, or link to our  site. Acorn has no control over these third party web sites.  Privacy policies on such linked sites may be different from our privacy policy.  Acorn does not endorse or sponsor other  web sites, is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of  non-Acorn sites, expressly disclaims any statements or assertions made on such  web sites, and denies all liability associated with your use of, and the  content on, such other sites and advertisement. You access such linked sites at your own  risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before  disclosing any personal information on such site. Consent to Processing in the United States By providing any personally identifiable information to Acorn, all users,  including, without limitation, users in the member states of the European  Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to  the collection, storage, and processing of such information in the United  States of America.
</p>

<h2>Policy Changes</h2>
<p>
  Acorn  reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our privacy  policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on our web  site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The  new policy will apply to all current and past users of our web site and will  replace any prior policies which are inconsistent. Your continued use of our web site or our services after the  posting will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
  Additionally, you will be deemed to have consented to the  disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of this web site, of  any information about you contained in the applicable Acorn database, if Acorn or  one of its companies assigns its rights and obligations regarding any of your  information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or  substantially all of Acorn 's or such Acorn company's assets related to the  applicable site or service to a subsequent owner or operator. In the event of  such a merger, acquisition, or sale, your continued use of the site or any  related service signifies your agreement to be bound by the Privacy Policy and  other terms and conditions (if any) of the site's or service's subsequent owner  or operator.
