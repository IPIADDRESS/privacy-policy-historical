  <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT </h2>
  <p>
  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the phrases "personally identifiable information", "personal information" or "personal data" (hereinafter referred to a "<strong>Personal Information</strong>") mean contact information and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information, such as your name, address, telephone number, etc. 
  </p>

  <p>
  We may collect and store Personal Information about you in connection with your use of the RLJE Service, including any Personal Information you transmit to or through an RLJE Site. We receive and store any data you enter on the RLJE Service or provide to us in any other way, including but not limited to signing up for an account, subscribing to one of our channels, using the RLJE Service directly or through one of RLJE's third-party providers, signing up to our marketing email mailing list, any communication with our customer service, or participating in our surveys, contests, sweepstakes and promotions. Even when we do not retain certain Personal Information, it may be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process such Personal Information. Some examples of Personal Information we collect are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>-	<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</strong>: As mentioned above, any information you volunteer for the purpose of using an RLJE Site or using an RLJE Service can be collected, including:
      <ul>
        <li>(1)	Required account set up details such as your name, email address, address or postal code, telephone number, password, birth date, payment authorization and any other information necessary to complete and record purchases and other transactions, as applicable;</li>
        <li>(2)	Optional information provided during the use of an RLJE Site, including, if applicable, reviews or ratings submitted, taste preferences and personal interests, account/profile settings, and information provided via participation in contests, surveys and/or marketing promotions (including gender, occupation and income level);</li>
        <li>(3)	Your activity on an RLJE Service, such as title selections, watch history, order history, search queries and schedules of use or information otherwise provided to us through an RLJE Service or elsewhere, if applicable; and</li>
        <li>(4)	We may invite you to participate in market research; if you decide to participate, we may collect and process certain personal information for these purposes, such as your contact details, image (if a photo is taken or the interview is filmed) and responses to our questions; and</li>
        <li>(5)	Communication data such as your interactions with our email, push and text messaging, details of your interactions with customer service, such as the date, time and reason for contacting us, transcripts of any chat conversations, and if you call us, your phone number and call recordings.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>-	<strong>AUTOMATIC/ANONYMOUS DATA</strong>: Some of the above data is collected and logged by us automatically and anonymously ("<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>"), in order to make an RLJE Site and the RLJE Service more useful to you. Here are some other examples of Anonymous Information we collect which is not directly provided by you:
      <ul>
        <li>(1)	<u>Data Collected by RLJE Servers</u>: RLJE's servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address (every device has a unique number, or IP Address, that is automatically assigned to your device when you use the Internet, which may change between sessions of use), your domain name, the date and time stamp of your visit, browser type, Internet service provider ("<strong>ISP</strong>"), referring/exit pages, operating system, and clickstream data. We use this information to recognize and analyze trends, administer RLJE Services, track our users' movement throughout RLJE Services, compile demographic information about our overall user base, and adapt RLJE Services to our users' needs.</li>
        <li>(2)	<u>Cookies, web beacons, and advertising identifiers</u>: Like most sites, RLJE's Services may use what are known as "cookies" in certain instances, or similar technology such as web beacons, and advertising identifiers, which may use small text files to store a randomly assigned ID and a website reference ID to make your device recognizable to RLJE. This technology is generally not used to store Personal Information. Cookies and other similar technology, as they now exist or develop, are used by RLJE to help remind us of our users' identities and tailor RLJE Services to reflect our users' personal interests, estimate our audience size, process user orders, facilitate and track user involvement in any of our contests, sweepstakes and other promotions, and analyze the visiting patterns of our users. </li>
        <li>(3)	<u>Mobile Device</u>: If you use an RLJE Service via a computer, phone, tablet or any other electronic device application or "<strong>App</strong>", RLJE may choose to collect Personal Information about the device you use to access the App, including your device's hardware model, the name and version of your operating system, your MAC address, the unique ID of your device, and what mobile network you are using. Please note that RLJE has no control over what Personal Information your device's platform operator, such as Apple and Google, collects and uses. We suggest in addition to this document, you review your platform operator's privacy policies to gain a better understanding of their own standards and practices regarding Personal Information.</li>
        <li>(4)	<u>Advertiser Collected Data</u>: RLJE may use third-party websites (such as social media sites including Facebook) to display ads for an RLJE Service. RLJE collects information from these advertising services about your visits to an RLJE Site via one or more of these advertisements, including but not limited to: your use of an RLJE Service, your IP address, your ISP, as well as the browser you used to visit an RLJE Site or the device you used to engage with an RLJE Service. These ads do not collect any specific Personal Information about you from third-party websites such as your name and contact information. The third-party websites use cookies and other technology to track this data. The information is collected by RLJE for analysis and visiting patterns, and may also be used, should a visitor to an RLJE Site become a user, to deliver targeted advertising based on your interests. This policy will only extend to RLJE's ads on third-party sites, and no other features on such third-party sites. RLJE is not responsible for third-party sites' collection, protection or use of your Personal Information. We suggest that, prior to using such third-party sites, you review their privacy policies to learn about their use of your information, as well as their implementation of cookies and similar technologies. If you would like more information about the practice of placing cookies on your device and to learn more about your choices regarding not having this information used by RLJE or any other third-party companies, please click here: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>-	<strong>NOTE REGARDING STATISTICAL DATA/SENSITIVE DATA</strong>: RLJE may ask for certain statistical data from you (including age, education and socioeconomic status) while performing surveys which will be purely voluntary and always subject to your express consent. All such information will be collected anonymously by RLJE for marketing demographic knowledge only. At no point will RLJE ask for or process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, data relating to criminal convictions or data concerning a user's sex life or sexual orientation. </li>

    <li>-	<strong>NOTE REGARDING ANONYMOUS VIEWING</strong>: In general, you can visit many RLJE Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.</li>

  <p>
  We use commercially reasonable encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe. Please refer to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's website for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft. Should RLJE experience a data breach involving your Personal Information, we notify you immediately of such breach (to the best of our ability based on your communication preferences) as well as inform you as to and the steps we will take to quickly remedy that breach.
