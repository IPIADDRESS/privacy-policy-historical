    <br>   
	<br>


        Decision Analyst will provide survey data and responses to Decision Analyst clients with no personal information disclosed by Decision Analyst, other than UIDs. If you voluntarily disclose personal information in connection with your survey responses, and Decision Analyst collects the survey responses, Decision Analyst will transfer the survey responses, UID and the voluntarily disclosed personal information to Decision Analyst's client.  In addition, Decision Analyst may share geographic and/or demographic data Decision Analyst collects from you during registration or through surveys.  Such data may be shared with third parties on an individual respondent level or as aggregate summaries.

        Decision Analyst's clients may engage Decision Analyst to supply or provide demographic information of or about individuals who have viewed an advertisement or visited a website for the purpose of measuring internet and digital media audiences. The demographic information may be provided or supplied to Decision Analyst's clients.

        Generally, disclosures of personal information by Decision Analyst to some other company or organization, except for disclosures of UIDs, are controlled by a written agreement between Decision Analyst and the other company or organization, which restricts and limits use of the personal information.  Decision Analyst may allow a client to collect personal information directly from panel members.  The disclosure is voluntary and, prior to collection, the client is required to enter into a written agreement with Decision Analyst, which restricts and limits use of the personal information.
