<h2>ACP Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Purpose </h3>

<p>To inform web site visitors of ACP's efforts to protect the privacy
of information collected at College web sites. Please note that some
of the links on College web sites connect to other web sites. Once you
leave any ACP web site and enter another web site (whether through an
advertisement, co-brand, service, or content link), be aware that any
information you disclose on or through those sites is not subject to
this privacy policy.  ACP does not endorse and is not responsible for
the privacy practices of any third party web sites to which we may
link. You acknowledge that such other web site locations are not under
the control of ACP and agree that ACP shall not be responsible for any
information or other links found at any linked site.  ACP provides
such links only as a convenience to you and has not tested any
software or verified any information disclosed on or through such
sites. You should always review the privacy policy for those sites to
understand how they treat your personal information.  Within College
web sites, this privacy policy applies only to the information
described below.</p>



<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The American College of Physicians is committed to protecting the
privacy of its members and customers. This document describes the
information we collect from our web site and how we use it. </p>


<p><b>Information collected when you visit ACP web sites</b></p>


<p>When you view pages and graphics on our web sites, the following
information is recorded in a log file: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The time and date of your request </li>
	<li>The internet address of your computer</li> 
	<li>The browser and operating system you are using</li> 
	<li>The page which you are viewing</li> 
	<li>The previous page that you visited (the referrer) </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have logged into a password-protected part of our web site,
we also record your user name. </p>


<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>ACP web sites send all visitors a cookie (small computer file) that
contains a unique serial number. Each time our web server receives a
request for a page, it checks to see if the cookie is present-this
enables us to determine how much of our traffic is from repeat
visitors. </p>


<p>Additional cookies may be sent by College web servers to facilitate
interaction between your web browser and the College's web
servers. For example, the Annual Session Day Planner uses cookies to
keep track of which courses you have added to your schedule. The
Shopping Cart uses cookies to keep track of items to be included in
your order. </p>


<p>You may use the College's web sites without accepting cookies. The
"Help" function in your web browser explains how to manage cookies
while using the Internet. Please note, however, that some services,
such as the Annual Session Day Planner and the Shopping Cart, will not
work if your browser will not accept cookies. </p>


<p>ACP uses cookies exclusively to make its web sites easier and
faster to use. <i>The College <b>does not</b> use cookies to monitor
the use of its web sites by individual users</i>.</p>


<h3>Personal information</h3>

<p>Personal information is information that can be used to identify or
contact you. Registration for ACP web sites is open only to College
members and subscribers to College journals or online products; it
requires only the provision of a valid member or customer number and,
for verification purposes, personal information already contained in
College member or customer records, such as name or birth date. <i>New
personal information is not collected as part of the registration
process</i>. In the course of using College web sites, however, you
may be asked to provide personal information in order to purchase a
product, participate in a College activity, or otherwise interact with
ACP. This information will not be shared with other organizations as
the result of your use of a College web site unless the form used for
collecting it explicitly states that it will be shared with another
organization. </p>


<p><i>Important note for College members</i>: ACP maintains a
membership database independent of its web operations. The information
in this database is drawn from membership applications, dues payment
forms, product orders and other transactions between the College and
its members. Using this database, the College occasionally shares
member data with other organizations. You may instruct the College not
to share your personal information by contacting Customer Service at
1-800-523-1546 or <a href="mailto:custserv@acponline.org">custserv@acponline.org</a>. In
rare instances, personal information may be disclosed for legal or
other reasons; these circumstances are noted at the end of this
document. </p>


<p>The College will not share your e-mail address with any other
organization. From time to time, the College may send you e-mail
regarding items of interest to the membership, including urgent health
matters.</p>


<p><b>How information is used</b></p>


<p>We use the information noted above to facilitate effective
operation of College web sites, to improve the design and performance
of our products, and to measure usage by members. We also review use
of our site by individual users if a user's account is associated with
1) attempts to violate the security of ACP computer networks, 2)
activity that degrades the performance of College web sites, or 3)
activity that may be related to copyright violation. </p>

<p>Information we record is collected into reports that enable us to
monitor usage and security. Usage statistics are distributed within
the College. They may be shared with advertisers for the purpose of
showing them how many hits their ads have received. <i>We do not
release any information that would allow identification of individual
users to outside companies.</i></p>


<p><b>Security and e-commerce</b></p>

<p>Our secure server enables you to transmit a credit card number to
us with confidence. Our secure server certificate is issued by
VeriSign. We do not store your credit card number after your
transaction has been processed. </p>


<p>If you have a question about our privacy policy, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:interpub@acponline.org">interpub@acponline.org</a>. </p>


<p><b>Disclosure of personal information contained in member and customer records</b></p>



<p><b>Disclosure required by law or emergency circumstances -</b><br>
Personal information is information that can be used to identify or
contact you. ACP may release personal information to third parties:
(1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation,
search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such
as a physical threat to you or others. In the event that we are
legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third
party, we will notify you unless doing so would violate the law or
court order. </p>


<p><b>Disclosure in the context of mergers and acquisitions -</b><br>
ACP may disclose personal information to an organization with which it
merges, or which acquires ACP or substantially all of its assets. Any
personal information provided to such organization will be provided
subject to that organization taking reasonable steps to keep personal
information private. </p>


<p><b>Disclosure to ACP operations and maintenance contractors
</b>-<br> ACP operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have
limited access to your personal information in the course of providing
products or services to ACP. Access to your personal information by
these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary
in order for the contractor to perform its limited function for
ACP. We also contractually require that our operations and maintenance
contractors 1) protect the privacy of your personal information, and
2) not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other
than providing us with products and services. </p>
