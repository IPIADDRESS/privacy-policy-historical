<p>Thank you for your interest and support of Austin City Limits  and for visiting austincitylimits.com. We know that you trust KLRU and intend to uphold that trust on the Web as well as on air. Our mission has always been to provide a place for life-long learning that is free of commercial influences and is a safe haven for your children.</p>
  
<p><b>Gathering and Using Personal Information</b><br>
The austincitylimitis.com Web site collects personal information from visitors on a volunteer basis. In order to provide customized features, we must ask you for some information about yourself. Your name will not be used for anything except Austin City Limits, Capital Sports and Entertainment (CSE) or KLRU purposes. We will never trade, rent or sell your name to any other organization. You may choose not to give us personally identifiable information but if you choose not to then you may not be able to engage in certain activities such as sending e-mail reminders to a friend.

<br><br>

<p><b>Security</b><br>
Information that you provide to Austin City Limits, CSE or KLRU such as your address, credit card information and other personally identifiable information is secure. We're using a secure server to collect and store this information. This means that each page you view and any information you submit as part of the pledging process is encrypted on its way between your computer and our server. Your peace of mind and making sure this information is safe and secure are our top priorities. Credit card transactions are also secure. All online credit card transactions are done through a secure server using 128-bit SSL; you know you're on a secure page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit card information is used only for your intended purpose -- that is, for the purchase or contribution you wish to make.</p>
