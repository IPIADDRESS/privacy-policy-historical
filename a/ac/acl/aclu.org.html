        <h2 align="CENTER">Privacy Statement for ACLU Freedom Network</h2>
        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union has created this privacy statement 
          to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy by informing site visitors 
          of the ACLU's data collection and storage practices, and guidelines 
          for use of visitor data.<br>
          <br>
          For more details about our advocacy work on electronic privacy, see 
          <a href="/issues/privacy/hmprivacy.html">/issues/privacy/hmprivacy.html</a> 
          <br>
          <br>
          The ACLU has filed comments on the National Telecommunications and Information 
          Administration's notice and request for comments regarding electronic 
          commerce, which may be found at <a href="/congress/l070698a.html">/congress/l070698a.html</a><br>
          <br>
          The following statements detail information gathering and dissemination 
          practices for the ACLU's Freedom Network, located at http://www.aclu.org 
          and any other associated sites using the aclu.org domain. 
        </p><h3>User Tracking and Data Capture Practices</h3>
        <p>Our servers collect and aggregate user information site-wide, including 
          anonymous site statistics, such as the number of views of each page. 
          We log domain names and/or IP addresses of visitors (such as umich.edu, 
          aol.com, 209.168.1.1, etc.), which permits us to know "where" visitors 
          are from, or what access service they use, without knowing their individual 
          identities. Because we do not require users to register with us, this 
          "host level" tracking is our primary basis for assessing traffic patterns.<br>
          <br>
          On certain pages such as the ACLU Membership Form, we give users the 
          option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, 
          email addresses, and other personal information, and various other kinds 
          of details. This more personal information is gathered only with users` 
          knowing and active permission and participation. <br>
<br>
The ACLU website does not use any cookies that are automatically written to your computer's hard drive or retained by the ACLU or our vendors. (Our activist tools do allow users to have a cookie written to their hard drives to enable them to more easily take action. For more information about this feature, see the section on "Activist Letters" below.)<br>
<br>
The ACLU website does set "session specific cookies" to help run its interactive online applications, such as the shopping cart. The session specific cookies only exist in your computer's short term memory (RAM) and only exist as long as the session lasts. They expire (disappear from your computer's memory) when the session ends. These cookies will NOT be written to a user's hard drive. Under no circumstance will any information associated with these cookies be retained or used by the ACLU or its vendors after the session is completed.<br> 
<br>
In addition, the third party email management provider that oversees the ACLU's newsletter distribution and data handling (see section below) will use cookies for the sole purpose of ensuring that an individual user can only access his/her personal profile and subscription information. This prevents a user from accessing or viewing another subscriber's personal or subscription information. By contract with the ACLU, the vendor will not transfer or sell any information that it collects from users of the ACLU website to a third party.<br>
<br> 
We review and discard the information in some cases (e.g. IP address logs for file transfers), while in others we may use the information to tailor our users` Web experience in the form of custom content or results drawn from databases. On some pages, users can sign up to receive additional information by e-mail through an e-mail subscription service (as discussed below), or by other means, including postal mail. Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members. No such combining will be done for marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
We may at some point share user information, including e-mail addresses, 
          with our local offices for the above named purposes. Website visitor 
          information is not shared or exchanged with other parties, with the 
          exception of those visitors who also become ACLU members (see below 
          regarding ACLU Member Address Exchange) and as provided for in the section 
          on email list subscriptions below. <br>
          <br>
          E-mail addresses of visitors and members are <b>never</b> exchanged 
          with other organizations except as provided for in the section on email 
          list subscriptions below.</p>
 <h3>Activism</h3>
        <p>Our activist letters and activist list are administered on acluaction.org, 
          a website that the ACLU runs on CapWiz, an electronic communication 
          service of Capital Advantage Inc. The contract between ACLU and Capitol 
          Advantage allows CapWiz to collect and store the personal information 
          that you provide on our behalf, but Capitol Advantage is prohibited 
          from sharing this information to any except the ACLU. The contract forbids 

          Capitol Advantage from renting, selling or trading any of this information.</p>
              <dir> 
        <p><b>Activist Letters </b></p>
        <p>Our write your elected representatives feature counts your letter and 
          its recipient, but does not record its content. Counting permits us 
          to track how many letters are delivered to which officeholders. Your 
          elected representative is selected according to the address you enter 
          when sending a letter. If you wish to have your address stored as a 
          "cookie" for future use on your computer, select the "remember me" option 
          when sending letter. If you do not select "remember me," your information 
          will not be stored on your computer or our server. If you choose to 
          be remembered, the cookie will be stored on your computer solely for 
          the purpose of retrieving your personal address when you send letters. 
          It will not be stored on Capitol Advantage or ACLU servers. </p>
 <p><b>Activist List </b></p>
        <p>By joining our activist list, you will receive periodic email informing 
          you of action that you can take in the defense of civil liberties. You 
          can join our action list by selecting "subscribe me to the ACLU's action 
          alert listserv" when sending an activist letter or you can subscribe 
          through our "Join Our Alert List" page. We will use the mail address 
          that you provide to assign your email address to the proper legislative 
          districts. Both your email and your mail address will be used exclusively 
          for the purpose of sending you email from the ACLU. You will not be 

          contacted in any other way, nor will your information be offered to 
          a third-party. </p></dir>
        <h3>ACLU Publications Merchandise Customer Records</h3>
        <p>The ACLU Freedom Network website store features a "shopping cart" tool 
          that relies on .perl script using a "session ID," and therefore does 
          not collect any customer data prior to the completion of the order. 
          E-mail addresses provided by customers are used only to communicate 
          about the customer's order. Customer postal addresses will never be 
          exchanged with other not-for-profit or advocacy organizations.</p>
        <h3>Tracking and the ACLU Membership Form</h3>
        <p>When website users click a button or link to "Join the ACLU" anywhere 
          on the ACLU Freedom Network website and possibly also on other websites, 
          data indicating that location is passed onto the membership form as 
          a hidden field and sent to our servers only when the form is completed 
          and sent by the user. Such tracking helps to assess which content is 
          persuading web visitors to join the ACLU. If a user wishes to evade 
          this tracking, they may join from the "join" link in the toolbar used 
          throughout our site. See more about sharing and the ACLU Membership 
          Form below.</p>
        <h3>Exchange of ACLU Member Addresses</h3>
        <p>Individual information about website visitors, including e-mail addresses, 
          is never shared with third parties (except as provided for in the section 
          on email list subscriptions below).</p>
        <p>However, the names and postal addresses of ACLU members, including 
          those who join through the ACLU Freedom Network website, may be exchanged 
          or rented to other organizations or publications under the procedures 
          outlined below.<br>
          <br>
          Members who join through the ACLU Freedom Network website are provided 
          with an opportunity to opt out of this exchange.</p>
        <p>Like most other non-profit membership organizations, the ACLU obtains 

          the names of potential new members by renting the membership lists or 
          subscriber lists of like-minded organizations and publications. Sometimes, 
          instead of paying the rental fee, ACLU exchanges its list with that 
          of another organization.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Whether by exchange or rental, the lists are governed by very strict 
          privacy procedures, as recommended by the U.S. Privacy Study Commission. 
          All exchanges are made on a "blind" basis, as follows: Lists are never 
          given into the physical possession of the organization which has rented 
          or exchanged them. This safeguard is necessary to prevent one organization 
          from knowing who the members of any other organization are. Instead, 
          usually through a list broker, the list, either in the form of labels 
          or tape, is sent to a mail house which prepares the mailing without 
          our ever seeing who is addressed. The only time we get possession of 
          a name from one of these lists is when the person receiving our invitation 
          to join responds by sending our return envelope back to us.<br>
        </p>
        <p>If the receipt of duplicate mailings is too burdensome, you may wish 
          to consider writing to each of the organizations to which you belong 
          and publications to which you subscribe, requesting that your name be 
          eliminated from lists made available for exchange or rental. The ACLU 
          always honors such requests, and we believe that the organizations with 
          which we exchange or rent lists honor them also, although of course 
          we can't guarantee the actions of outside organizations.</p>
        <h3>Financial Data Security</h3>
        <p>Membership and merchandise sale forms that collect financial information 
          (such as a credit card number) are offered over a Netscape Commerce 
          Server that encrypts the data for delivery to our contractor's server, 
          and all financial data is stored or transmitted using appropriate security 
          measures.</p>
        <h3>Email List Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>The ACLU uses your email address to update you on news that you have 
          requested. To deliver this information to you, we use ClickAction Email 
          Relationship Management (ERM), an email marketing service that helps 
          us to conduct targeted permission-based email campaigns. When registering 
          for our email newsletter(s), ClickAction may collect and store the personal 
          information that you provide on our behalf, but the contract between 
          the ACLU and ClickAction prohibits it from sharing, renting, selling 
          or trading any of this information to parties other than ACLU. In addition 
          to its own strict privacy policy, ClickAction is a member of several 
          industry privacy associations including: the Coalition Against Unsolicited 
          Commercial Email and TRUSTe. ClickAction also adheres to all Federal 
          and State privacy laws such as the FTC's privacy guidelines and other 
          industry standards. To learn more about ClickAction's privacy policy,

        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications 

          from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. 
          We offer the options below to view, modify, or delete your records with 
          us. <br>
