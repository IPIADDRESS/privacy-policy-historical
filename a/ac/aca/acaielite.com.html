              <p>Acai Elite and all its related web sites (“Acai Elite”) Privacy Policy<br>
        PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. Acai Elite DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.<br>
        IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO Acai Elite OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
        The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Acai Elite<br>
        This policy applies to Acai Elite's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Acai Elite on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Acai Elite's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Acai Elite is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.<br>
        <br>
        1. Collection of Information.<br>
        <br>
        1.1 Survey Information.<br>
        Acai Elite collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Acai Elite survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Acai Elite or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Acai Elite , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Acai Elite may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Acai Elite or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Acai Elite or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Acai Elite.<br>
        <br>
        1.2 Third Party List Information.<br>
        Acai Elite collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Acai Elite subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Acai Elite seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Acai Elite and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
        <br>
        1.3 Other Information.<br>
        Other occasions when Acai Elite obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Acai Elite or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Acai Elite's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Acai Elite service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").<br>
        <br>
        1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.<br>
        Acai Elite currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Acai Elite may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").<br>
        <br>
        (a) Cookies.<br>
        A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Acai Elite to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Acai Elite's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.<br>
        <br>
        (b) Web Beacons.<br>
        A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Acai Elite to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Acai Elite might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Acai Elite's database, visits the fishing website, Acai Elite receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Acai Elite would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Acai Elite may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Acai Elite also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Acai Elite's database.<br>
        <br>
        (c) New Technology.<br>
        The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Acai Elite's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Acai Elite strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.<br>
        <br>
        1.5 Outside Information.<br>
        Acai Elite may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of Acai Elite including information located in public databases ("Outside Information").<br>
        <br>
        1.6 Individual Information.<br>
        As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information Acai Elite gathers or receives about individuals.<br>
        <br>
        1.7 No Information Collected from Children.<br>
        Acai Elite will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Acai Elite obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, Acai Elite has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Acai Elite has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").<br>
        <br>
        1.8 Credit Card Information.<br>
        Acai Elite may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Acai Elite. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Acai Elite, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. Acai Elite will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
        <br>
        2. Use of Individual Information.<br>
        <br>
        2.1 Discretion to Use Information.<br>
        THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
        The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Acai Elite currently uses Individual Information, but Acai Elite may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, Acai Elite may update this policy from time to time. Acai Elite may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.<br>
        If you do not wish us to use personal information about you to promote or sell our products and services or to sell, transfer or otherwise provide personal information about you to third parties, please inform us by contacting customer service at 1-888-888-8888 and we will certainly honor your request.<br>
        <br>
        2.2 Email.<br>
        Acai Elite uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. Acai Elite may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.<br>
        <br>
        2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.<br>
        In certain commercial email messages sent by Acai Elite, an advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Acai Elite. The "Subject:" line of Acai Elite email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to Acai Elite.<br>
        <br>
        2.2(b) Solicited Email.<br>
        Acai Elite only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from Acai Elite or to individuals who have agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as Acai Elite. Acai Elite does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Acai Elite's email messages.<br>
        <br>
        2.3 Targeted Advertising.<br>
        Acai Elite uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Acai Elite uses Technology Information (see also Section<br>
        <br>
        2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's Individual Information, and Acai Elite attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. Acai Elite may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.<br>
        <br>
        2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.<br>
        Acai Elite uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.<br>
        <br>
        2.5 Use of Technology Information.<br>
        Acai Elite uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of Acai Elite's web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps Acai Elite to better understand the online habits of individuals so that Acai Elite can target advertising and promotions to them.<br>
        <br>
        2.6 Profiles of Individuals.<br>
        Acai Elite uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.<br>
        <br>
        2.7 Storage of Individual Information.<br>
        Acai Elite stores the Individual Information in a database on Acai Elite computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Acai Elite's control. Not withstanding such measures, Acai Elite cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent Acai Elite computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.<br>
        <br>
        3. Dissemination of Individual Information.<br>
        <br>
        3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties.<br>

        3.5 Access.<br>
        Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information. Access can be obtained by contacting customer service at the number on the order page.

        <br>
        4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.<br>
        <br>
        4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.<br>
        Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals. Acai Elite does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and Acai Elite has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about individuals.<br>
        <br>
