<br>
BY USING THIS WEBSITE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO JOURNEYED.COM THROUGH THIS WEBSITE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE COLLECTION, USE, TRANSFER, AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT.
<br>
<br>
<b>Scope of this Privacy Statement</b><br>
<br>
<i>In General.</i> This Privacy Statement applies to each website operated by JourneyEd.com, with headquarters at 5212 Tennyson Pkwy.

The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to provide you with information concerning how we collect personal information when you use this website, and how we collect other information regarding your interaction with this website without identifying you as an individual; how we use, handle and disclose collected information; and choices you may have about the ways we collect and use that information. Our goal in handling personal information provided to us is to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and to offer users of our website notice, choice and consent regarding processing for direct marketing purposes, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement with regard to personal information.<br>
<br>

<i>Third Party Privacy Policies or Statements. </i> If you access a website through which we offer products or services for sale, you may see our web pages co-branded with the name and branding of the organization whose product you are purchasing. If the privacy policy or statement of one of our partners also appears on this website, this Privacy Statement will apply to our use of any information collected by us, and the privacy policy or statement of our partner will apply to any such information provided to that partner as contemplated by this Privacy Statement and any supplemental Privacy Notices.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Statement</b><br>

We may occasionally update this Privacy Statement.  These updates may reflect, among other things, changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations, changes in our data collection practices, and/or changes to our business or services.  Changes to our Privacy Statement will become effective 30 days after posting and will only apply to your personal information we hold if you use the site after the revised statement becomes effective. If revisions to the Privacy Statement materially affect how we may use Personal Information collected from you prior to the date of the revised statement, then we will request that you opt-in to the revised Privacy Statement.

<br>
<b>Collection of Information</b><br>
<br>
We collect personal information you provide when you use this website. This may include, but is not limited to, the following situations: where you are providing information when you request information about, or use, a product or service available through this website, or information you provide when you purchase a product or service through this website; where you are entering a contest or a promotion, ordering a newsletter or utilizing other informational tools; in connection with a telephone call you receive from us; and where you are submitting an order or purchasing, downloading and/or registering products and/or signing up for additional services.<br>

The information we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, IP address, billing and/or shipping address, phone number, payment account information, and other information about you submitted to verify who you are or to prevent fraud.  You may also be required to provide proof of eligibility for academic pricing which may include but is not limited to a birth certificate, social security number, school identification, or a valid driver's license.  If you call our customer service, we may collect personal information you knowingly and voluntarily provide through your contact with our customer service representatives.<br>
<br>
We furthermore collect information that is sent to us by your web browser, which may include without limitation information that does not identify you personally (such as the date and time of your visit, information about your web browser, etc.). The information we receive in such manner depends on the settings on your web browser. If you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. Please review the settings of your web browser if you want to learn what information your browser can send or how to change your browser settings.<br>
<br>
We may also receive certain personal information about you from third parties where you have agreed to share such information with us, such as through your use of a social network authentication to sign in to this website.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies and Web Beacons, JavaScript tags, and Other Web Technologies</b><br>
<br>
We collect information that is typically not personally identifiable through the use of web technologies, including without limitation "session cookies," "persistent cookies," "web beacons" (also referred to as "tracking pixels,"), "pixel tags," or "action tags"), and "Javascript tags." As the Internet evolved, we may implement and use different types of technologies for this purpose.<br>
<br>
We may place web technologies on this site directly, and may place web technologies on behalf of the partner whose branding appears on this website or its service providers and allow that partner to utilize the data collected.  They also help us identify your IP address.  The information collected by web technologies does not identify you personally. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this website, for example, by making a purchase, we may link the information we collect using web technologies to the information that identifies you personally.<br>
<br>
<i>Cookies.</i>  When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more "cookies" in order to help personalize and support your use of this website, our services, and/or the services of our partners. A "cookie" is a small text file that is transferred to your computer's web browser by a web server, and can be read by a web server in the same domain at a later time.  If you do not wish to receive cookies or wish to manage when you accept cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. We provide more information on this in the "Your Choices" section, below. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this website. Cookies allow a website to customize information that is presented to you through your use of this website (such as to display personalized content and targeted advertising to you on your future visits to this website), and to save time by storing information so you do not need to re-enter it during a later use of our website. In general, cookies do not identify you personally. We may use a combination of "session cookies" and "persistent cookies" on this website, further described below.<br>
<br>
<i>Session Cookies. </i>A "session cookie" is a temporary cookie that expires when you close your browser. A session cookie assigns a randomly-generated, unique identification number to your computer when you access this website. Assigning your computer a number facilitates the proper functioning of the features of our websites by permitting us to maintain a  for your session, such as maintaining the contents of your shopping cart during checkout. We also use session cookies to collect anonymous information (i.e., information that does not identify you personally) about the ways visitors use this website - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page. We analyze this information (known as "click-stream information") to better understand our visitors' interests and needs and to improve the content and functionality of this website.<br>
<br>
<i>Persistent Cookies.</i> Unlike a session cookie, a "persistent cookie" does not expire when you close your browser. It stays on your computer until the expiration date set in the cookie (for example, at the end of a calendar month) or until you delete it.  Persistent cookies can be used to "tag" your computer so that the next time you visit (or someone using your computer visits), our server will recognize you, not by name, but by the "tag" on your computer. This will enable us to provide you with a personalized experience even if we do not know who you are. It will also allow us to collect more accurate information about the ways people use this website, for example, how people use this website on their first visit and how often they return.  Using persistent cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database.<br>
<br>
<i>Web Beacons. </i> When you visit this website, your computer may receive one or more "web beacons" in order to assist us with delivering cookies on this website, to collect anonymous information about the use of this website by our visitors, and to deliver customized or targeted content to you on this website and through our partners.  Web beacons (also referred to as "tracking pixels," "1x1 gifs," "single-pixel gifs," "pixel tags," or "action tags") are graphic images, usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel, placed at various locations on this website. They also help us identify browser types, search terms that bring visitors to our website, and the domain names of websites that refer traffic to us. We also utilize web beacons to provide us with more information on any emails we send out.  In particular, a web beacon in an email communication will send us information to let us know that you have received, opened, or acted upon an e-mail you have chosen to receive from us.<br>
<br>
<i>JavaScript Tags.</i>  This website may include one or more JavaScript tags which are used by us to collect anonymous information about the use of this website by our visitors, and to deliver customized or targeted content to you on this website and through our partners.  We may use JavaScript tags to anonymously track how visitors interact with our websites, including where they came from and the manner in which they use our websites.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Storage, Use and Sharing of Information</b><br>
<br>
Your personal information provided to us will be processed on our computer servers or those of one of our corporate affiliates providing infrastructure hosting services to us.  In some cases (where it is necessary to do so in order to fulfill our contractual obligations to you) such information may also be transmitted or made available to (i) third-parties providing services to JourneyEd.com or (ii) product manufacturers, licensors and/or or suppliers, located in the United States of America or another territory outside the EEA.<br>

We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was originally collected (or to which you have subsequently consented), for other legitimate purposes (such as regulatory compliance), and as permitted or required by applicable law. We may retain eligibility verification information you provide for a period of three (3) years. We will observe applicable law and take reasonable steps to ensure any person or entity receiving personal information for the purposes described above, are obligated to protect and keep secure the personal information on your behalf.<br>
<br>
<i>Our Use of Anonymous Information.</i>  We may use anonymous information collected by us:<br>
<ul>
<li> to personalize and support your use of this website, our services, and/or the services of our partners;
</li><li> to improve this website, the customer experience, our advertising systems, and our products and services;
</li><li> for fraud prevention purposes, such as device fingerprinting;
</li><li> to identify actions or transactions as originating through an affiliate marketing or referral program;
</li><li> to deliver targeted advertisements on this website and other websites;
</li><li> to provide reporting to our current and prospective partners and service providers; and
</li><li> for other historical, statistical or research and analysis purposes. 
</li></ul><br>
In addition, we may "de-identify" personal information by removing any information that identifies you specifically, and use the rest for the purposes set forth above.<br>
<br>
<i>Our Partners.</i> When we make a vendor's products available for sale through a website we operate, we are doing so as an independent e-commerce reseller of, or service provider for, that vendor, and if the website is co-branded, the partner whose name and/or logo appears on the particular website. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate, we will provide certain of the personal information and/or anonymous information you provide to our partner whose branding appears on the particular website in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this website such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this website and our s website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you.

We may also provide certain of the personal information you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this website.  The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you provide, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your personal information that we provide to them.<br>
