<p>This Policy explains what <a href="#information_we_may_hold">personal information</a> Academy Music Group, (known in this Policy as “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>AMG</strong>”) part of the <a href="http://www.livenation.co.uk/about" target="_blank">Live Nation</a> family of companies, <a href="#we_collect_your_information">collect</a> both online (including through apps) and offline and <a href="#we_may_use_your_information">how we use it</a>. Please read it carefully.</p>
<p>Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).</p>
<p>When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described <a href="#you_have_certain_choices">here</a>.</p>
<p>AMG works together with various organisations to bring you the events you love.&nbsp; We call these organisations our Event Partners and these range from, for example, the authorised ticket agents who sell tickets on our behalf, the venues in which our events are held or the artists who we promote. The ticket agents or venues may share your information with us, for the purposes described in this privacy policy. For more detail about how we collect your information click <a href="#we_collect_your_information">here</a>.</p>
<p>AMG is responsible for the processing of your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. <a name="_Toc343608074" id="_Toc343608074"></a></p>
<p><strong>Cookies Notice</strong></p>
<p>We and third party organisations use cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags on our websites and in our emails. For more information about cookies and how to disable cookies, please see our <a href="./cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>We collect your information in different ways</h2>
<p><strong>Directly from you.</strong> For example, if you register for a promotion, create an account, enter a competition or free prize draw, download an app or buy tickets, post a comment on our websites, or get in touch with us in any other way.</p>
<p><strong>Through your use of our websites and apps.</strong> You may view and use our websites and apps via a computer, phone, tablet or other device. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons on our websites and apps to collect information about your usage. To learn more, please see our <a href="./cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>From our Event Partners.</strong> For example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>when you buy tickets via our authorised ticket agents, these ticket agents may give us certain information about you.&nbsp; This includes your name, email and postal address;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>venues, that host the events you buy tickets for, may give us certain information about you, including your name, email and postal address.&nbsp; Information about how we use your information is available <a href="#we_may_use_your_information">here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>From third parties.</strong> For example: if you choose to use an integrated social media feature on our websites or apps, the third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Information we may hold about you</h2>
<p>We use the following information for the purposes described in this Policy:</p>
<p><strong>Your contact and account information.</strong> We will hold contact information you provide (e.g. name, address, phone number, email, country of residence, preferred language) when you create an AMG account, buy a ticket using one of our authorised ticket agents and/or participate in our competitions or promotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your payment and billing information.</strong> We will hold payment and billing information you provide to us, e.g. credit card number and post code when you buy a ticket, in connection with the handling of your ticket orders or any merchandise. If you’ve asked us to, we may also store payment and billing information to make it easier for you to buy tickets in future.</p>
<p><strong>Information you post online.</strong> For example, we hold information you post on our website or on a third-party social media site to which we have access (including reviews you post or surveys you complete). When you post information online, you must not infringe the rights of others (including privacy rights) and you should be aware that others may use, tag and/or re-publish your information in ways that you might not expect (including in ways that are unlawful). You understand that we and others may use and re-publish any data you post online publicly, on our website or when using apps or social media tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information on your preferences.</strong> We may collect information about events you like or products you buy or enquire about (e.g. as part of a survey or from your review of an event). We may also hold information on interests and demographic categories inferred from your interactions with us in order to provide you a better service and to provide you with more focused information. For example, if you buy tickets to a certain show and lots of people who went to that show also bought tickets for a different concert, we might send you information about that concert.</p>
<p><strong>Information from other companies.</strong> We will hold information (e.g. your interests, purchases and household type) provided to us by other companies. We may also add information to your details which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or a publically available postal address list, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys.</p>
<p><strong>Website usage information.</strong> If you use our websites, we may collect information about the browser and device you're using and your IP address (this is a number that identifies a specific network device on the internet and is required for your device to communicate with websites). We might look at what site you came from, what you did and didn’t use our site for, or what site you visit when you leave us.</p>
<p><strong>App(s) usage information.</strong> If you use our app(s), we may collect your GPS location or your device's unique identifier. We might also collect the type of device you are using, or the version of the operating system your computer or device is running. We might look at, for example, how often you use the app and where you downloaded it. Where you allow us to we may also scan your music library when you download our app(s) so that we may send you information about events you may be interested in in your area. Your choices about how we use mobile information are described <a href="#you_have_certain_choices">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Email response information.</strong> In relation to emails we send you, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags to collect information on how you respond to such emails, for example, the number of times the email is opened or the links in them are clicked etc. We partner with third parties who may also use such cookies and other technologies in our emails. Please see our <a href="./cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Other information about your interactions with us.</strong> For example, if you interact with us via a box office, email, telephone or social media (e.g. Facebook).</p>
<h2>We may use your information in the following ways and for the following purposes</h2>
<p><strong>To provide you with products, services, account information and support. </strong>For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for an event. If you give us your friend's information, we will use it to provide services you request from us. Before you give us a friend’s information, please do make sure that you have your friend’s permission to share that information with us.</p>
<p><strong>To send you communications in connection with your transaction and events you attend.</strong> For example, we might send you emails about your account or a ticket purchase or ask you if you would like to review an event you attended. We might also contact you about this Policy or any of our other policies or terms.</p>
<p><strong>To identify trends and interests.</strong> We use your information to get to know what your preferences might be so we can improve our offering to you and so that your experience with us is more relevant and personal. We may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties, including to analyse customer behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>To monitor and improve our products, services, and websites. </strong>We analyse your information to improve our understanding of you and our customer base in general. We do this so that we can make better decisions about our services, advertising, products and content, based on a more informed picture of how our customers use our current services, and to provide you with a more customised experience.</p>
<p><strong>To prevent or detect unlawful behaviour or to protect or enforce legal rights. </strong>For example, we may use your information to prevent ticket touting, misuse of our intellectual property, or fraud (including credit card fraud and fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion or at an event) or other crimes. If you are evicted from one of our events we may retain your details and you may be refused entry to any of our future events.</p>
<p><strong>For security purposes.</strong> We may use your information to protect the security of our company, employees, our customers, third parties and/or our/their property (including any events you may attend and our websites) as permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>For market research purposes. </strong>We may contact you as part of market research we are carrying out. You may choose not to participate.</p>
<p><strong>To provide you with tailored advertising and online behavioural advertising.</strong> We may work with other companies to show you advertisements we think you may find relevant and useful. This may include advertisements displayed on our own websites or apps, or advertisements from us displayed on other companies’ sites. The advertisements you see may be based on information collected by us or third parties and/or may be based on your activities on our websites or third party sites.

<h2>You have certain choices about how we use your information</h2>
<p>When you create an account, purchase tickets or download our apps, we may ask for your <strong>consent</strong> in order to collect, process or use your personal information for specified purposes.</p>

<h2>In addition to contacting us, you can opt out in the following ways:</h2>
<p><strong>You can opt out of receiving marketing communications including newsletters.</strong> To stop receiving marketing communications, you can log into your account and change your preference or follow the instructions in any promotional message you get. . It may take about ten days to process your request. Don't worry! Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still be sure to send you transactional messages. For example, we may still contact you about your orders.</p>
<p><strong>You can control and opt out of the use of cookies and tracking tools.</strong> To learn how to manage how we use cookies and other tracking tools, please see our <a href="./cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You can change your marketing preferences with our Event Partners</strong> (e.g. opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from an Event Partner) by contacting that Event Partner or by following the instructions on any messages they send to you.</p>
<h2>We may share your information with the following third parties</h2>
<p><strong>Within the Live Nation family of companies.</strong> We may share any or all of your information with our group companies for any of the purposes referred to in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Our Event Partners. </strong>We may share any of your information with our other Event Partners so that they can also run the event for which tickets have been purchased, analyse customer behaviour, provide a better service and support to customers, and for any other purpose described in our Event Partners’ privacy policies (including marketing).

<p><strong>Our Commercial Partners:</strong> If you purchase tickets to an event through a promotion or rewards programme provided by another company, we may share your personal information with that company. You should read their privacy policy to learn how they treat your information.</p>
<p><strong>Selected third parties.</strong> If you consented to be contacted by email or other means by selected third parties, we may provide your information to them and they may include charities and retail companies for example, companies offering financial, health, leisure or subscription services.</p>
<p><strong>Our third party service providers.</strong> We may share your information with third parties so that they can provide services to us (e.g. a mailing house, a courier, a call centre provider, &nbsp;a market research company or online behavioural advertising companies), but where we do we will put in place a written agreement protecting your information.</p>
<p><strong>Third parties who provide goods and services purchased by you.</strong> Your information may also be shared with relevant third parties offering goods and services you have purchased through our website (e.g. ticket insurance or merchandise) so that they can process and fulfil your orders (including by contacting you).&nbsp;</p>
