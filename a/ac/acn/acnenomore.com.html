      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE 
      STILL COVERED</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the event that a person excluded from this

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION 
      IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong> 
</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy 
      is a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the

      site and you are fraudulently using this site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE 
      PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to 
      comply with the California Act. Various provisions throughout this Privacy 
      Policy address requirements of the act. In summary, you must presume that 
      we collect electronic information from all visitors. This is not usually 
      personally identifiable. If you purchase a product or service via this 
      website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement 
      you electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect 
      and archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit 
      and/or transfer that personal information to third parties. There is no 
      way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so. Under 
      the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive 
      any information about our database. In the event that the website, under 
      advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must 
      submit whatever information is demanded by the website in insure that the 
      website is releasing information to the correct party. Other provisions of 
      the OPPA may exempt this website from complying. While we take measures to 
      ensure that outside parties do not have access to any information we have 
      about you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our 
      system and thus have access to your information. (You should know that 
      merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card 
      information.) This Privacy Policy also is subject to change without 
      notice. You are required to read it prior to using the website. By 
      interacting with the website you agree to the terms and conditions of the 
      Privacy Policy. By using the website or purchasing a product through this 
      website, you waive the right to use state or federal court systems to 
      address complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration 
      Association located in a city and county specified herein. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS 
      WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This website routinely collects information 
      about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers. This information 
      is obtained in various ways, such as: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR 
      CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Registration means that the Visitor, 
      Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate 
      information to this website. This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you 
      register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include 
      your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting 
      information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from 
      joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or 
      unpaid; it may be from ordering a product. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Occasionally complete credit card information 
      may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than 
      regular secure merchant service processing. This information is kept at 
      the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the 
      merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the 
      customer. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication 
      provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies 
      like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not 
      provide complete credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, 
      the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone 
      number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password. 
      You should consider all this information available to the website. This 
      information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase 
      Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong> 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Website visitors who wish to communicate with 
      the website do so under two conditions: one, they give their permission 
      for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ 
      provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy 
      Policy. While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it 
      is added to the website's general solicitation database. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR 
      TESTIMONIALS</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;If you are a customer and send an email 
      to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the 
      website collects information about your communication and by communicating 
      with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and 
      otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Any communication which, in its sole 
      discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for 
      commercial purposes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR 
      INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or 
      hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that 
      information is being collected about them. This site is not responsible 
      for the use of information collected in such a fashion. Visitors must 
      assume that (1) information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will 
      usually be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any 
      control over what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no 
      responsibility over the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that 
      website is not responsible for downloads from third party advertisers that 
      contain viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their computer 
      or software harm, and (6) that website assumes no responsibility for the 
      data that is garnered from the click itself or that the advertiser 
      collects. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING 
      EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you send a friend an email from this site or 
      if you send the url or one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume 
      that some data is collected about your IP address or your email address 
      and that of your friend. You must assume that referred emails or web pages 
      may appear to come from your email. You must accept fully responsibility 
      for referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site 
      for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said 
      referrals. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY 
      VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you 
      must assume that any information provided to the website as part of a 
      survey in which you participate may be used for general solicitation for 
      commercial purposes and that such information will be shared with joint 
      venture partners, affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site 
      itself for product design or solicitation purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;<strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 
      ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many websites, including this one, collect 
      information about your computer, your email address, your IP address. You 
      must assume that your web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, 
      tracked, and information collected. This information is not usually of a 
      personal nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product 
      preferences even though the website may or may not have any idea who you 
      are. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of computer 
      code placed on your hard drive. Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', 
      to keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use 
      of the site or use of products sold by the site. Cookies can also be used 
      to obtain information about your computer configuration or your use of 
      your computer. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies can be used to electronically gather 
      information about you. Again, it may or may not be personal information, 
      but it is information and by using this site you are expressly giving 
      permission to use 'cookies' and to use the information gathered from their 
      use to benefit you. You also give permission to collect, archive, 
      retrieve, and use any information collected for product design, product 
      offers to you, and general commercial solicitation purposes by this site 
      or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong> 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The use of information as described below may 
      or may not be how information that is collected is customarily used by 
      this site. While actual use of any information collected may be used quite 
      conservatively, you must assume that it is not. You must assume that 
      information collected is shared with other persons or entities for 
      commercial purposes. While this is uncommon in practice, you must assume 
      that it is as you make your decision whether or not to view or interact 
      with this website. This type of shared information may include your name, 
      address, phone number, email address and buying habits, as well as other 
      information. This information may be used for general commercial 
      solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to, rented to, or

      provider of such information gives express permission to use it in fraud 
      investigation or for litigation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC 
      FORUMS</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Visitors, subscribers, members, or 
      customers who use any site provided bulletin boards or other public

      that the site monitors these services or protects you in any manner from

      services. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>SPAM </strong></font></p>

      solicitations or information from the website and your name will be
