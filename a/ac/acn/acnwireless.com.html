          <h3>What Information We Collect and How We Use It </h3>
          <p>Location Information</p>
          <p>We collect location information in order to improve your shopping
            experience. If you shop for location-specific products such as a
            wireless rate plan, we ask for a zip code and record this information
            via a cookie so that we may display only services which are available
            in your area. We also save this information so that we don’t
            have to ask for it again on your next visit.</p>
          <p>Information from IP addresses is used to help administer our Web
            site, to examine overall traffic trends, and to help us improve our
            site and make your browsing and purchasing experience more enjoyable.
            IP addresses are not linked to any personally identifiable information. </p>
          <p>Personally Identifiable Information</p>
          <p>When you place an order for products or services we collect certain
            types of personally identifiable information required to fulfill
            those products or services, including (1) contact information (such
            as name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number); (2) payment
            information (such as credit card number); and/or (3) ID verification
            information (such as credit card number, date of birth, Social Security
            Number, or Driver's License Number).</p>
          <p>We only collect ID verification information if it is required by
            a wireless carrier to process your application. For those customers
            applying for a new wireless service account, we submit your data
            into the wireless carrier's system so that the carrier may perform
            a standard industry credit check. Aside from approval status information,
            we do not have access to an applicant's credit-history information.</p>
          <p>If you would like to place an order but are reluctant to provide
            this information online, you may provide it to us by telephone during
            normal business hours. Telephone agents are available when the Order
            By Phone button is visible on one of the shopping pages of our site.
            Simply click on this button to speak to an agent and provide your
            information over the phone.</p>
          <p>We use the contact information you provide to communicate with you,
            such as to send you order confirmations, respond to your inquires,
            provide you with important product update, warranty, or safety information.
            In addition, we use contact information you provide to offer you
            additional products, programs or services that we believe may be
            of interest to you, including newsletters from wireoffers.com. You
            can easily opt out of a newsletter by clicking the unsubscribe link
            at the bottom of any of these e-mails.</p>
          <h3>Supplementation of Information</h3>
          <p>We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect
            online with outside records (e.g., information from our strategic
            partners, wireless providers, or the United States Postal Service)
            to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you,
            and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that
            we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
          <h3>Sharing of Your Information</h3>
          <p>Please be assured that any third parties who have access to the
            contact information you provide, including our subsidiary site, agents,
            contractors and business affiliates have agreed to protect it in
            a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.</p>
          <p>To fulfill your requests for products and services, we may need
            to share some of your personally identifiable information with the
            wireless provider from which you have requested service. More specifically,
            when you place an order for a new wireless account, we will share
            contact and ID verification information required by the wireless
            carrier to provide you with its services. The wireless provider may
            use this information for credit approval, service activation, and
            from time to time, for its own marketing purposes. You should consult
            the wireless providers' respective privacy policies, as this Notice
            does not cover their use of your information. Also, your shipping
            information will be shared with a shipping company such as FedEx,
            for the purposes of delivering your order.</p>
          <p>We work closely with trusted third party business affiliates to
            provide you with information on products and services that may be
            of interest to you. We may share the contact information you provide
            with trusted third parties for the purposes of analyzing it to make
            your customer experience better or for offering products and services
            to you. In addition, you can access InPhonic through many third-party
            co-branded Web sites. For example, if you see a logo on the page
            that says "Powered by InPhonic," you are on a co-branded page. Whenever
            you provide contact information on a co-branded page, that data may
            be shared with the third-party site through which you access InPhonic.
            We encourage you to read the privacy policies of such third parties,
            as this Notice does not cover their use of your information.</p>
          <h3>Sharing of Affiliate Information in the Affiliate Sign-Up Process</h3>
          <p>Information submitted by potential Affiliates in the Affiliate Sign-Up
            Process is submitted to Linkshare. Linkshare's privacy policy can
            be found at <a href="http://www.linkshare.com" target="_blank">www.linkshare.com.</a></p>
          <h3>Third Party Sharing of Information</h3>
          <p>InPhonic sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions, affiliations,
            sponsorships) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified
            third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties
            may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily
            submit to participate in the site activity.</p>
          <h3>Live Help Function</h3>
          <p>To better serve you and respond to your questions regarding our
            products or services, we also maintain a Live Help function through
            which we can respond, in real time, to your questions about our products
            and services. This information enables us to understand the types
            of questions our users have about our products and services so that
            we may continue to improve our content and offerings.</p>
          <h3>Other Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
          <p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about
            our visitors when you visit many of our Web pages such as the type
            of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the
            type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows XP or Mac
            OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g.,
            America Online, Earthlink).</p>
          <p>We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect
            to improve the design and content of our service pages and to enable
            us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this
            information in the aggregate to analyze service usage.</p>
          <h3>Legal Process/Disclaimer</h3>
          <p>We may disclose personally identifiable information in response
            to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires
            it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law
            enforcement agency's request.</p>
          <h3>Choices/Opt Out</h3>
          <p>If you prefer not to receive marketing information, including emails
            from us, or wish to fully deactivate your account information from
            our records if you are no longer an active customer, simply let us
            know by sending a letter via certified mail to InPhonic, Inc., c/o

            even if you choose to opt out of marketing programs, if you are an
            active customer we will continue to send you important service-related
            communications (e.g., order confirmation or product safety information)
            which is not promotional in nature.</p>
