    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
<div id="content_div_5846">
 <p><b>ACS Privacy Policy - Current at March 12, 2014</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
This Privacy Policy is based on the Australian Privacy Principles
contained in Schedule 1 in the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection)
Act 2012 which amends the Privacy Act 1988. </p>

<p>Protecting personal information
is important to the ACS and personal information will be held in strictest
confidence.</p>

<p>Personal information will only be
used for the purposes it was collected or in the way that the provider has given
ACS permission to use it.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Types
of Personal Information the ACS Collects and Holds</b></p>

<p>Personal Information
means information or
an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably
identifiable:</p>
<p>(a) whether the information or opinion is true or
not; and</p>
<p>(b) whether the information or opinion is
recorded in a material form or not.</p>

<p>We
generally ask for all or some of the following types of personal information :</p>
<p>·
Title, name, address and contact
details;</p>
<p>·
Gender;</p>
<p>·
Date of birth;</p>
<p>·
Credit card or bank account
details.</p>

<p>Depending
on the service you select we may also ask for other types of personal
information such as:</p>
<p>·
Employment information</p>
<p>·
Educational qualifications</p>
<p>·
Academic transcripts</p>
<p>·
Current course of study in ICT at
an Australian institute or RTO&nbsp;</p>
<p>·
Passport details</p>
<p>·
Birth certificate</p>

<p>The ACS does not collect
Sensitive Information as such, noting however that membership of the ACS as a
Professional Association is itself Sensitive Information.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why we collect Personal
Information</b></p>
<p>The ACS collects
personal information for the purposes of :</p>
<p>(a) providing members with a
comprehensive range of membership products and services and with valuable
information regarding relevant products and services from the ACS and
appropriate ACS contracted third parties; </p>
<p>(b) performing its role as a ‘Skills
Assessment for Migration’ agency; </p>
<p>(c) providing professional
development events (courses, conferences, seminars, workshops etc) for the
general public; </p>
<p>(d) conducting the ACS Professional
Year Program in ICT ;and</p>
<p>(e)
seeking
a better understanding of member needs in order to develop a continually
relevant range of membership products and services.</p>
<p>When collecting personal
information by whatever means the ACS will ensure that appropriate notices are
given and consents obtained in accordance with the Australian Privacy
Principles. Most information is collected directly from the individual
concerned. ACS also may obtain some personal information from third party
sources. In such cases ACS will require a warranty from the third party that
the information has been collected in accordance with Australian Privacy
Principle, including notification that the information may be disclosed to
organisations like the ACS.</p>
<p><b>How
we collect Personal Information</b></p>

<p>Normally
the personal information we require to deliver our products and services we
collect directly from you. We do so:</p>
<p>·
by using written forms</p>
<p>·
via the internet including websites and social media</p>
<p>·
by email</p>
<p>·
by telephone</p>
<p>·
in person to person contact (e.g. at forums and
trade shows)</p>
<p>·
through security surveillance cameras (installed in
some ACS offices)</p>
<p>We also
collect Personal Information from third parties e.g. migration agents acting on
your behalf.</p>
<p>We may keep
unsolicited personal information (personal information we receive that we have
taken no active steps to collect) if the information is reasonably necessary
for one or more of our functions or activities.</p>
<p>Our website uses
cookies to provide a number of services to you and to us, including statistics
on access to ACS sites. Cookies in use within the ACS may identify individuals
who log into our sites. You can reject cookies but doing so may limit your
functionality within our website (note: Cookies provide much information which
is not Personal Information).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Personal information provided to
ACS will not be disclosed to other organisations or individuals without the
provider's express permission or when obliged to provide such information by
lawful authority.</p>

<p>Marketing our products and
services is important to us in order to fulfil our role. We use a number of
direct marketing strategies and channels including email, mail, sms, social
media and telephone.</p>

<p>The ACS will from time to time
enter into contractual agreements with other organisations to provide
services/benefits to ACS members. On occasion, personal information on ACS
members will be released to those contracted third parties for the purposes
that the contract was entered into. Our contracted third parties may use
similar marketing strategies and channels as the ACS.</p>

<p>Members have an Opt In/Out facility on the
ACS website to grant/withdraw consent as required. Non-members can use the
unsubscribe facility attached to marketing communications or can contact the
Privacy Officer (details below) to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>The ACS does not disclose
personal information to overseas recipients.</p>

<p>ACS will never sell, trade, lease
or rent any personally identifiable information to other organisations except
as stated and agreed when collecting information from members or other persons.</p>
<p>The ACS reserves the right to
communicate with members about the essential affairs of the Society.</p>

<p><b>Security of Personal Information</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have
implemented technology and security processes to protect the personal
information that we have collected and we will take all reasonable steps to
protect the information. However, there are risks in transmitting information
across the Internet so we cannot ensure the security of any information
transmitted to us online and individuals do so at their own risk. Our websites
have electronic security systems in place, including the use of firewalls and
data encryption. User identifiers and passwords are also used to control access
to your personal information.</p>

<p>ACS limits physical access to its
offices. ACS maintains all personal information, including its membership and
'in-house’ mailing lists, subscriber details and web server logs, in controlled
environments that are secured against unauthorised access. Proof of identity is
to be required before information is released to any person, including a
member.</p>

<p>ACS servers are located in an ISO
27001 (Information Security Management System) certified facility.</p>
<p><b>Correct, update or delete
personal information</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every effort is made to ensure
that personal information held is current, accurate and complete. In
particular, members can access, and are expected to update as necessary, their
contact details and professional development activities through the ACS
website.</p>

<p><b>Access to Personal Information</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Any individual has the right to
seek access to personal information we hold on them. </p>
<p>Members can readily access and
amend as necessary their own personal information by visiting My ACS/Membership
on the ACS website.</p>

<p>Non-members can access the
personal information we hold on them by contacting the ACS Privacy Officer
(details below), either in writing or by email. The person seeking access will
be asked to verify their identity before the information is released.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Contracted Service Providers</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Contracts with all service
providers/consultants whose service involves access to personal information
must be subject to contract terms that include compliance with the ACS Privacy
Policy. Specifically, third parties, such as mailing houses, which receive
personal information in order to provide a service for the ACS are required to
sign an undertaking that the information will only be used for the purpose for
which the information was provided.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>Complaints</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Complaints concerning the collection, disclosure or handling of your
Personal Information by the ACS should be addressed to the ACS Privacy Officer
(details below). Any complaint should include the date, time and circumstances
of the matter, how you believe your privacy has been invaded and how you would
like your complaint resolved.</p>

<p>The Privacy Officer will attempt to resolve the complaint within 5
business days but this timeframe may be extended if further information is
required from the complainant and/or an involved third-party.</p>

<p>If the complaint is not resolved to your satisfaction you can refer it
to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. </p>
