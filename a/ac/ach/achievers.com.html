<p>Date of issue: September 30, 2016</p>
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Achievers Corp. (together with the companies owned by and in common ownership with Achievers Corp, "Achievers") is committed to protecting the privacy of users who use the Achievers public Web Site (the "Website") <a href="http://www.achievers.com/">http://www.achievers.com/</a>.</p>
<h2>SCOPE</h2>
<p>Achievers has developed data practices that comply with applicable privacy laws and is designed to appropriately protect the information of the user.  This privacy policy describes how Achievers collects, protects, uses, and discloses Personal Information that it receives. All user information collected through the Website is governed by this policy.</p>
<h2>NOTICE</h2>
<p>"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number and e-mail address and includes information about your business, service and recorded complaints.</p>
<p>Personal Information is collected by Achievers when you specifically and knowingly choose to provide it to us, such as when you choose to receive program information, register for events, or engage in the service offering provided by Achievers.</p>
<p>Achievers collects and uses your Personal Information primarily for the purpose of providing you with the information, products and services you have requested from us</p>
<h2>VISITING OUR WEBSITES</h2>
<p>When you visit any Achievers Websites and navigate from page to page or download content onto your computer, we record the pages that are visited and the content that is downloaded.</p>
<p>We use this information to determine the number of people visiting our Websites and sections of the sites are visited most frequently. This helps us to determine the type of information that is most useful to our visitors so that we can improve our Websites and make it easier for you to access information.</p>
<p>Achievers logs the date and time, the URL of the referring page (if applicable) and originating IP address of your computer or network that you use to access our sites. This is done for systems administration and security related purposes. Your IP address identifies the location of your computer on the internet.</p>
<h2>USE OF COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITES</h2>
<p>Achievers uses a browser feature called a "cookie" to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on and off Achievers Websites. We may also use cookies to show you relevant advertising across third party web sites and to determine how that ad performed.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Website. Cookies contain a unique identification number that identifies your browser, but not you, to our systems each time you visit one of our Websites. Cookies tell us which pages of our Websites are visited and by how many people. Achievers does not collect any Personal Information about you through cookies nor can a cookie carry a damaging payload (such as malware).</p>
<p>There are two types of cookies in use with Achievers Websites which include:</p>
<ul><li>Session based cookies – Only used for the length of time you remain on the Website and expire when you leave the Website.</li>
<li>Persistent based cookies – Are more permanent in nature and can re-used when you return to the Website from the same computer.</li>
</ul><p>The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on our Websites.</p>
<h2>"DO NOT TRACK" BROWSER SETTING</h2>
<p>Achievers does not respond to web browser "do not track" (DNT) settings or headers with respect to Achievers public Websites. Currently no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted and there is also no consistent standard of interpreting user intent when the DNT setting is enabled. Achievers takes privacy seriously will continue to monitor policy advocates, technical experts, regulators and companies attempting to create a consensus interpretation around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>
<h2>EMAIL</h2>
<p>When you send us an e-mail or when you ask us to respond to you by e-mail, we collect your exact e-mail address and any information you have included in the e-mail message.</p>
<p>We use your e-mail address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We may use your e-mail address to send you information about offers on products or special promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Achievers uses images imbedded in e-mail messages called "web beacons". Web beacons are clear images that allow Achievers to determine if a message has been opened. It also allows Achievers to determine the IP address of the user that opened it and to access any Achievers cookies. We may use this information in the aggregate to assess and improve our email messages.</p>
<p>Email web beacons can be disabled by turning off HTML display and displaying text only or by turning off image display while still using HTML within your email client.</p>
<p>Remember that e-mail sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted and transmitted in clear text. We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format e-mail messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as unique user IDs, passwords or Personal Information) in those messages. Confidential information should be transmitted to us through other secure methods as defined by Achievers.</p>
<h2>CHOICE</h2>
<p>If you indicated that you were interested in receiving information from our website, or other marketing initiatives (webinars, conferences, etc.) your personal information would also be used to contact you or to send you materials via e-mail and other mailings about products and services that might be of interest to you.</p>
<p>In the case that you enter a contest or other promotion offered by Achievers, your Personal Information will be used to administer the promotion, including the use of your name and selected other information for the purposes of contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the contest or promotion.</p>
<p>If you don't want us to contact you by e-mail with offers on products and special promotions, you may tell us by selecting the unsubscribe option at the bottom of the communication or by contacting the Privacy Office.<br>
Achievers may also contact you from time to time to conduct market research and surveys in an effort to continually improve our product and service offering.</p>
<p>Anonymous or "non-personal" information gathered by Achievers through our Websites may be used for technical, research or analytical purposes. Information collected through surveys, existing files and public archives may be used by Achievers to analyze our markets and to develop or enhance product or service offerings.</p>
