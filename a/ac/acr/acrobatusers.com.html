Please regularly review our Privacy Policy. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Site and the Products and Services enabled by the Site and follow the procedure described in the section entitled "Updating your personal information and privacy preferences."

</p>
<p>
	The Site and the Products and Services are intended for adult audiences, and Adobe does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.
</p>

<h2>Changes in Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
	All personal information ("personal information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. Adobe may change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice of all changes in the Privacy Policy through indications on this Privacy Policy and in the footer of the web pages with authorized links to this Privacy Policy.  If as the result of such changes you want to alter the ways in which Adobe is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled "Updating your personal information and privacy preferences." You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to Adobe you limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Adobe or by third parties, Adobe will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if Adobe sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or Adobe (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with another entity, you agree that Adobe may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without obtaining your further consent.  Adobe will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or mergers on this Site.
</p>

</p>

<h4>Collection of personal information</h4>
<p>
	As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with  other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Products and Services,  Adobe may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out  and submitting a form. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If  you elect to engage in these activities, however, Adobe may ask that you  provide certain personal information (as well as certain non-personal  information that may be tied to personal information), such as your first and  last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country of residence, e-mail  address, employer, job title and department, and telephone and facsimile  numbers,. When ordering Products and Services via the Site, you may be asked to  provide a credit card number and billing and shipping information. Depending  upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is  identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the  mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to  engage in that activity. Similarly, if you wish to delete your information  (pursuant to the mechanism set forth in "Updating your personal information and privacy preferences") that is mandatory, you will no longer be able to engage in that particular activity.
</p>

<p>
	When you use the Site and the Products and Services, Adobe may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of  the Site and the Products and Services. For example, we may log environmental  variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit  webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the  browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of  your computer. Adobe also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on  the Site and usage of the Products and Services. We do not match such  information with personal information held about you by Adobe unless we have  your consent, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
	By using this Site and the Products and Services, you agree and acknowledge that  personal information collected through the Site or in connection with the  Products and Services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored  and processed in any of the countries around the world in which Adobe maintains offices, including the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain  countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer,  storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted third  party vendors or agents of Adobe such as credit card processors, shipping  agents, web hosting providers, mail and email service providers,<span class="achtung">communication services</span>, and web analytic providers,  to help facilitate Adobe in providing certain functions.&nbsp; Another instance where this could occur is in  conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible,  and the pages are hosted for Adobe by such third party vendors. For example, on the sign up pages for some newsletters, the pages may be hosted by a third  party vendor, but appear to be Adobe.com pages and they are therefore governed  by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Personal  information may be shared with these providers to fulfill the service. Such  third parties are bound by contract with Adobe not to use your personal  information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.
</p>

<p>
	Adobe has established relationships with various providers of services and products who are not part of Adobe and who may not themselves be providing products and  services to Adobe or on Adobe's behalf ("Providers").&nbsp; Providers do not include third parties  contracted by Adobe to perform services on Adobe's behalf. The services of  these Providers may be available to you from the Site, from websites that are  linked to the Site, or in connection with the Products and Services. Typically,  these Providers offer services that Adobe customers might find useful, such as  those that can be used in conjunction with Products and Services. In order to  use Providers' products and services, you may be required to provide personal  information to the Providers or agree to allow  Adobe to share your personal information with such Providers. Unless expressly  provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are  visiting a Provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that site, and personal information that you provide while on the Site will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
	In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, prevent fraud  and prevent abuse of our Site and the Products and Services, as well as to provide  more consistent, relevant experiences to our users, we may on occasion  supplement or correct the personal information you submit to us and your  Internet Protocol (IP) address with information in our other databases or  information from third-party sources. For example, if permitted under  applicable law, we may supplement your Registration Information with address  information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and  prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the  information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as  age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to  make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest  to you.
</p>

<h4>How your personal information is used</h4>
<p>
	Adobe  collects your information in order to record, support and facilitate your  participation in the activities you select and to prevent fraud and unlawful  use. If you subscribe to or register for Products and Services, for example,  the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support  or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another  example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry  and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal  information may also be used to track customer preferences to provide a  customized Site experience and keep you informed about product upgrades,  special offers, and other products and services of Adobe and selected Providers  unless you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications  are prohibited by law.&nbsp; Adobe does not  share personal information it receives from residents of California or from residents of any other  place with such Providers for the Providers' own marketing purposes unless  Adobe has received an opt-in from you.
</p>
<p>
	Adobe  may collect information about the use of the Products and Services and the  Site, such as the number of downloads, types of Services used, how many users  we receive daily, Site pages visited, and the IP address of your computer. This  information is generally collected in aggregate form, without identifying any  user individually, although IP address and Session ID in relation to purchases  and downloads may be tracked as part of Adobe's customer order review and fraud  prevention efforts.&nbsp; Other exceptions to  this, where an individual may be identified individually, are noted in this  Privacy Policy or in additional privacy terms connected to a specific Product,  Service or website.
</p>
<p>
	Adobe  may use aggregate, nonidentifying statistical data for improving the Site and  the Products and Services, providing more relevant experiences to our customers  and for statistical analysis.
</p>
<p>
	Certain  Products and Services may require you to use the most current version of such  Product and Service or are offered in conjunction with other Products and  Services, which you may or may not have already downloaded. The Product and  Service may automatically check to determine if you are using the most current  version or have other Products and Services and through e-mail messages, pop-up  boxes or similar mechanisms inform you if need to upgrade in order to use the  Product and Service you have requested. During this process, an IP address  identifying your computer and the Product and Service version may be sent to a  Web server, but system profile information is not transmitted nor are cookies  used to store information.
</p>

<h4>Your choices with respect to personal information</h4>

<p>
	Adobe recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information  collected on the Site and in connection with the Products and Services. Adobe  will respect your legal rights regarding access to, and correction and deletion  of, your personal information. Adobe may communicate information to you  regarding products, services, and special offers available from Adobe unless  you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications are  prohibited by law, although in such cases we may find it necessary to continue  to communicate with you regarding your use of the Site and the Products and  Services. In addition, you may receive communications and special offers from  selected Providers (or from Adobe on behalf of such Providers), but only if you  previously opted in to receive such communications. Except in the particular  circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Adobe will not provide your  name to other companies or organizations without your consent.&nbsp; If you have opted to receive email communications from our selected Providers and later wish to discontinue  receipt of these emails, please contact those third parties directly to update  your preferences.
</p>
<p>
	There are other instances in which Adobe may divulge your personal information, such  as when required by law, regulation, or litigation. We may also disclose  information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for  reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public  importance.
</p>

<h4>Protection of your personal information</h4>
<p>
	The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself  as a user of the Site or of the Products and Services is classified as  Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several  ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a  password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We  recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your  Registration Information resides on secure servers that only selected Adobe  personnel and contractors have access to via password. Adobe encrypts your  personal information as it is transferred to Adobe and thereby strives to  prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information.
</p>
<p>
	Personal information that you provide that does  not constitute Registration Information also resides on secure servers and is  accessible only to selected Adobe personnel and contractors via password. Since  this information is not accessible online by you, you will not be asked to  select a password in order to view or modify such information.
</p>

<h4>Community  Sites</h4>
<p>
	Please  note that any information you post to a public bulletin board, blog or chat  room (such as the Adobe User to User Forums) and to community help, wikis,  cookbooks, personal sharing URLs (such as your_name_here.photoshop.com) and  user profiles (the "Community Sites") is available to all persons accessing  that location, and your e-mail address and other personal information or  content you upload may also be posted on these Community Sites. The information  you share, including your email address, would then be available to all persons  accessing these Community Sites, and such information may be read, collected or  used by others for any purpose, including sending you unsolicited messages.  Adobe is not responsible for any information you elect to submit in these  Community Sites or the use of such information. In addition, you should be  aware that some Community Sites offer a service in which subscribers are  e-mailed a copy of all messages posted to the Community Sites on a particular  topic. Consequently, if you post a message to such Community Sites, your e-mail  address will be sent to those subscribers who have indicated an interest in the  topic of your message.&nbsp; If you do not  wish for your personal information to be posted or distributed in this manner,  you should not participate in the Community Sites.
</p>

<h4>Data not collected on this Site or in connection  with the Products and Services</h4>
<p>
	Personal information that is not collected on the Site or in connection with the Products  and Services is not generally subject to this Privacy Policy. However, personal  information submitted on physical product registration cards is classified as  Registration Information and is subject to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy  Policy also covers licensee information (such as contact name and address)  provided in connection with Adobe's volume licensing program. If you wish to  access and/or correct such information, please see instructions for doing so in  the section entitled "Updating your personal information and privacy  preferences."
</p>

<h4>Tracking, use of cookies, web beacons and similar devices</h4>
<p>
	In  order to improve our Products and Services and the Site and provide more  convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our vendors and agents  may use "cookies," "web beacons," and similar devices to track your  activities. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your  browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  It functions as your identification card and enables Adobe to record your  passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver  viruses. A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an  HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A  similar device may be used by which a Product and Service may send data to a  server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as the "Add to Cart"  button is clicked. This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your  visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data. It is  different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an  identification card, and does not store any data on your computer.
</p>		
<p>
	While Adobe uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site and the  Products and Services (such as the number of downloads, types of Products and  Services used and downloaded, how many users we receive daily, the Site pages  visited), and web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your  computer, Adobe does not generally use this information to identify you  personally. Exceptions to this are noted in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you expressly provide consent for the Site  or the Product and Service to "remember" the unique identifier that  you select when you register for various activities on the Site or the Products  and Services, that unique identifier will be stored on a persistent cookie on  your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Registration Information.  As a result, your navigation path around the Site and the Products and Services  will be tracked in identifiable form.
</p>
<p>
	Adobe may also collect data about your online activities on the Sites for use in  providing content and advertising tailored to your interests; if this occurs, you will be able to <a href="/misc/optout.html">choose whether or not to have your information collected  for such purpose</a>.&nbsp; Some Products and Services allow the tracking of  access to or use of Products and Services by users, as opposed to Adobe. For example,  certain Products and Services allow document authors to restrict access to  documents, track access to or use of those documents, or involve communications  and transmission of data over the Internet to verify the authenticity of  documents, authors and recipients. In many cases, this type of tracking will be  obvious to you as a user of the Products and Services, and in others, the  software and services license or terms of use, pop-up boxes, or email messages  will inform you of these features and your options, such as disabling options.
</p>
<p>
	Some Products and Services require activation, which tracks information including  installation rights and number of installations. Please see <a href="/activation/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/activation/main.html</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
	Personal Information that users provide about other individuals for tell-a-friend or  other referral features on the Site or within Products and Services is used by  Adobe to send an initial communication to the person whose details you have  provided, and is not retained in Adobe's systems.&nbsp; If you are invited by someone else to  participate in shared editing or viewing of documents, photos, websites or  other content, you will typically be required to contact the person who invited  you to update, correct or delete the personal information they provided about  you.&nbsp; In general, even though we may  delete an account you hold with us in these types of shared editing or viewing  areas, we may continue to retain information regarding your past actions with  respect to content reviews or sharing initiated by others.
</p>
<p>
	We may also ask you to provide information of others such as when reporting  suspected piracy.&nbsp; In this instance, we  will ask for the person's or company's name and contact information so that we  may investigate.&nbsp; Personal information  supplied in these instances will only be used for the purpose being submitted.
</p>
<p>
	Most browsers are initially set to accept  cookies, and most Products and Services that include similar devices are  typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to  notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or the related Products and Services.) Information about non-cookie tracking devices and their features, including disabling options, are contained in the information materials provided with such Products and Services or on Site pages relating to such Products and Services. 
</p>
<p>
	Adobe also hires other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction ("third-party advertisement servers"). They do not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviors associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. Adobe may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Products and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies. Should you have any complaints about the practices of any of these companies you should contact <a href="mailto:privacy-officer@adobe.com">privacy-officer@adobe.com</a>.
</p>

</p>
<p>
	TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with this Site to resolve your concerns.
</p>
<p>
	If you provide Adobe with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating  on one occasion that Providers may contact you with marketing offers and  indicating on another occasion that they may not), Adobe will endeavor to  update your privacy preferences in Adobe's records with the latest preference in  a timely and accurate manner. Also, please note that Adobe is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of non-Adobe websites to which this Site or any other Adobe website may link.  You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the sites.
