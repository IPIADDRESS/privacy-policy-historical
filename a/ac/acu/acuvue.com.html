              </b> Welcome to www.acuvue.com, www.definity2.com, and www.jnjvisioncare.com! 
              This site is owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. This Privacy 
              Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, 
              use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this 
              site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, 
              or submitting information, to this site. This site is intended for 
              use by residents of the United States.</p>
            <p><b>Your Consent</b><br>
              By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
              Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the 
              collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance 
              with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><b>About Children </b><br>
              This site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will 
              not knowingly collect information from site visitors in this age 
              group. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their 
              use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.</p>
            <p><b>Active Information Collection</b><br>
              Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from 
              its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting 
              you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, 
              and/or chat rooms. Some of the information that you submit may be 
              personally identifiable information (that is, information that can 
              be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, 
              e-mail address, phone number, and so on). </p>
            <p>Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in 
              order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter 
              subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate 
              in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). 
              You will be informed at each information collection point which 
              information is required and which information is optional.</p>
            <p><b>Passive Information Collection</b><br>
              As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively 
              collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the 
              information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet 
              Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data 
              collection. </p>
            <p>We use <b>Internet Protocol (IP) addresses</b> on this site. An 
              IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet 
              Service Provider so you can access the Internet and is generally 
              considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because 
              in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect 
              to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's 
              computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our 
              server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route 
              for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer 
              and improve the site.</p>
            <p>A "<b>cookie</b>" is a bit of information that a Web 
              site sends to your Web browser that helps the site remember information 
              about you and your preferences.</p>
            <p>"<b>Session</b>" cookies are temporary bits of information 
              that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise 
              turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation 
              on Web sites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This 
              site uses session cookies.</p>
            <p>"<b>Internet tags</b>" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, 
              clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies 
              and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address 
              and browser type related to the visitor's computer. We do not use 
              Internet tags at this site.</p>
            <p>"<b>Navigational data</b>" ("log files," "server 
              logs," and "clickstream" data) are used for system 
              management, to improve the content of the site, for market research 
              purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This site 
              uses navigational data.</p>
            <p><b>Use and Disclosure of Information</b><br>
              Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve 
              the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, 
              to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for 
              our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified 
              in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, 
              we may combine such information with other actively collected information 
              unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We will 
              take reasonable measures to prevent personally identifiable information 
              from being combined with passively collected information, unless 
              you consent otherwise.</p>
            <p>We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other 
              Johnson &amp; Johnson affiliates worldwide that agree to treat it 
              in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may disclose 
              your personally identifiable information to third parties, located 
              in the United States and/or any other country, but only <br>
              (i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to contractors we use to support our business 
              (e.g., fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services, 
              and financial institutions), in which case we will require such 
              third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy 
              Policy;<br>
              (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in connection with the sale, assignment, 
              or other transfer of the business of this site to which the information 
              relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to 
              treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy; or<br>
              (iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where required by applicable laws, court 
              orders, or government regulations.</p>
            <p>In addition, we will make full use of all information acquired 
              through this site that is not in personally identifiable form.</p>
            <p><b>Access and Correction</b><br>
              To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, 
              and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take 
              reasonable steps to update or correct personally identifiable information 
              in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site.</p>
            <p><b>Security</b><br>
              We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable 
              information as you transmit your information from your computer 
              to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and 
              unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You 
              should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure 
              or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may 
              not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding 
              what information you send to us via e-mail. Moreover, where you 
              use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on this 
              site, it is your responsibility to safeguard them.</p>
            <p><b>Links to Other Web Sites</b><br>
              This site may contain links or references to other Web sites. Please 
              be aware that we do not control other Web sites and that, in any 
              case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. We 
              encourage you to read the privacy policy of every Web site you visit. 
            </p>
