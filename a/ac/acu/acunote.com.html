practices described in this notice.</p>
<p><u>Please 
be aware that any personally identifiable or other professional information 
that you voluntarily choose to have displayed publicly on the Acunote 
Services – including your username, alias, or ID 
– becomes publicly available information and may be collected and 
used by others without restriction</u>.</p>
<p>This 
Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Acunote 
<b><a href="terms">Terms of 
Service</a></b>.  Your use of 
the Acunote Services and any personal or professional information you 
provide on the Acunote Services are subject to the terms of this Privacy

</ul>
<h4><u>The Way Acunote Uses Information</u>:</h4>
<ul class="markers text">
  <li>Acunote uses the information 
  you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide 
  all of the features and services found on the Acunote Services including 
  without limitation accessing your SCM Systems on your behalf and displaying 
  organizational, task, timeline, and backlog information related to projects 
  inputted by you or another contact within your organization.  </li>
  <li>Acunote reserves the right 
  to use your email address, without further consent, for administrative 
  purposes such as notifying you of major Acunote Services updates, for 
  customer service purposes, or to address copyright infringement issues.</li>
  <li>Acunote uses all of the information 
  that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our 
  Users, to improve the way the Acunote Services work and look, and to 
  create new features and functionality. </li>
  <li>Acunote may use “automatically 
  collected” information and “cookies” information to:  (a) 
  determine user-specific access permissions and remember your information 
  so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next 
  time you visit the Acunote Services; (b) provide customized third-party 
  content, and information; (c) create project-timeline forecasts and 
  offer other project-management related features; (d) monitor aggregate 
  site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; 
  and (e) track your project entries, submissions, and status in any other 
  activities. </li>

  <li>Acunote will not use your 
  email address or other personally identifiable information to send promotional 
  or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific 
  program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>When Acunote Discloses Information</u>:</h4>
<ul class="markers text">
  <li><b>Acunote does not share 
  your personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations 
  for their <i>marketing </i>or <i>promotional </i>

  provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill 
  orders; conduct data analysis and create forecasts and reports; offer 
  certain functionality; and assist Acunote in improving the Acunote Services 
  and creating new services features.  We require that these parties 
  process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we 
  authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these 
  parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.</li>
  <li>Acunote may also disclose 
  Subscriber information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith 
  belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal 
  laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial 
  or other government subpoena, or warrant.  In some cases, we may 
  make such disclosures without providing notice to Users. </li>
  <li>Acunote also reserves the 
  right to disclose Subscriber information that we believe, in good faith, 
  is appropriate or necessary to take precautions 
  against liability; protect Acunote from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful 
  uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims 
  or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect 
  the security or integrity of the Acunote Services; or to protect the 
  rights, property, or personal safety of Acunote, our Users, or others.</li>

<h4><u>Your Choices</u>:</h4>

profile information and preferences at any time by going to the account 
section of the Acunote Services.  </p>

<p>To

uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards 
to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information 
you transmit to Acunote, and you do so at your own risk.  Once 
we receive your transmission of information, Acunote makes commercially 
reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  However, 
please note that this is not a guarantee or warrant that such information 
may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any 
of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

Acunote learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to 
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective 
steps. Acunote may post a notice on the Acunote Services if a security 
breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal
