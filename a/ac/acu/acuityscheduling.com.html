</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.3 Information Collected by Cookies.</strong>
    We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your
    visits to our Site. It is not uncommon for websites to use cookies to
    enhance identification of their users. A "cookie" is a small amount of data
    that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. A
    cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you access our
    Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie,
    each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers
    will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we may have
    knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage. We use automatically
    collected information and other information collected on the Service
    through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service,
    such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or
    Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent
    visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information;
    (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Service and third-party
    marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as
    total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries,
    submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the
    Service. You can learn more about cookies by visiting
    <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">
        http://www.allaboutcookies.org
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your
    browser, which is installed in the computer you are using to access the
    Site. If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser to
    accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject all
    cookies. If you reject all cookies you may be required to re-enter your
    information on our Site more often and certain features of our Site may be
    unavailable.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of Cookies we may use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Session Cookies.</strong>
        We may use Session Cookies to operate our Service.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Preference Cookies.</strong>
        We may use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various
        settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Security Cookies.</strong>
        We may use Security Cookies for security purposes.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or tracking utility
    companies) may use cookies on our sites. We do not have access or control
    over these cookies. For example, our website utilizes Google Analytics, a
    common website analytics tool that transmits website traffic data to Google
    servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual
    users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We
    use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand our website
    traffic and webpage usage. For more information about Google Analytics,
    please refer to the website, “How Google uses data when you use our
    partners’ sites or apps” at
    http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. If you would like to opt
    out of Google Analytics across all websites, you may do so using the
    “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on” found at
    https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
</p>
<p>
    We may also use tracking pixels (also known as clear gifs or web beacons),
    which are invisible 1x1 pixel images that are requested from a remote
    server via a url that typically contains small strings of encoded
    information, which may in part be determined by cookies. When a tracking
    pixel is requested from a server, that server may decode and process this
    information, for example, storing it to serve log files for future
    analysis. For example, our Site may use pixels to helps us track
    conversions from ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted
    audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified leads. Please use the
    following link if you would like help opting out of any remarketing pixels
    and related technologies: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.4 Collected Information.</strong>
    By “Collected Information” we mean information collected by cookies,
    information collected by Clients that is provided to us or collected by us
    as Client Data, Registration Information, Publishing Information, Usage
    Data, Payment Information, Account Activities Information, Statistical
    Information, Marketing Information, Disclosed Personal Information and any
    information we may collect from you, from our affiliates, or from other
    parties or through any other means.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.5 Online Tracking / Do Not Track.</strong>
    We do not track you across third party websites to provide targeted
advertising and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (“    <strong>DNT</strong>”) signals. However, some third party sites do keep
    track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which
    enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such
    sites, your internet browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your
    browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not
    want to be tracked.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. How we Use Collected Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Acuity Scheduling may use the Collected Information for various purposes:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.1 General</strong>

        such disclosure is required by law, regulation or administrative order
        of any court, governmental or regulatory authority.
    </li>
    <li>
        To protect and defend the rights or property of Acuity Scheduling,
        including to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>5. Retention of Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Acuity Scheduling will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is
    necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as reasonably
    necessary to provide, promote and support the Service. We will retain and
    use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
    obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply
    with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements
    and policies.
</p>
<p>
    Acuity Scheduling will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis
    purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time,
    except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
    functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this
    data for longer time periods.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Transfer Of Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and
    maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country
    or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may
    differ than those from your jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information
    to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to
    United States and process it there.

<p>
    <strong>7. Co-Branded Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have established relationships with other parties to offer you the
    benefit of other products and services that we ourselves do not offer. We
    offer you access to these other parties either through the use of
    hyperlinks to their sites from our Site, or through offering "co-branded"
    sites in which both ourselves and these other parties share the same
    uniform resource locator, domain name or pages within a domain name on the
    Internet. In some cases, you may be required to submit information for
    purposes of registering or applying for products or services provided by
    such third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy of such other
    parties may differ from ours, and we may not have any control over the
    information that you submit to such third parties or co-branded sites. We
    therefore encourage you to read that policy before responding to any
    offers, products or services provided by such other parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Security Of Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Client or User who has registered with the Service, your
    Registration Information, Publishing Information and Payment Information
    (if any) can be viewed and edited through your account, which is protected
    by a password. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to
    anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an
    unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. If you share a computer
    with others, you should not choose to save your login information (e.g.,
    User ID and password) on the computer. Remember to sign out of your account
    and close your browser window when you have finished your session.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a User or Visitor, please note that no method of transmission
    over the Internet, wireless transmission, or method of electronic storage
    is perfectly secure. The security of your data is important to us, and we
    strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data.
    However, we cannot guarantee its security. You agree that we are not
    responsible for any electronic communication and/or any of your data which
    may be lost, altered, intercepted or stored without authorization during
    the transmission of any data whatsoever across networks not owned and/or
    operated by us. We will not have any liability to you for any such misuse
    or disclosure. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into
    our system that materially affects you, then we will promptly notify you in
    accordance with applicable legal requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. Children's Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our Service does not address and is not directed towards anyone under the

    you should make any request for a copy of your Personal Data to such
    Client.

        safeguards may be obtained
    </li>
    <li>
        To object to our processing of your Personal Data under certain
        circumstances

        To be informed of your right to complain to a supervisory authority if
        you feel that we have not complied with applicable laws regulating your

    Personal Data regarding this request. Please further note that you may be
    asked to verify your identity before receiving a response to such requests.

    Personal Data. Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we
    may be entitled to refuse requests where exceptions apply. For more
    information, or to make a request, please email:
