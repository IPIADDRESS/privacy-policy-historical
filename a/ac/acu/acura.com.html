            </p>
            <p>Some of our sites, such as automobiles.honda.com and owners.honda.com/owners.acura.com, use web beacons also called single pixel gifs. Their use helps us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Certain gif files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick.

The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy.

            </p>
            <p>The information you share with American Honda is used to improve the services we provide you and to provide services to you that you request. &nbsp;For example, if you enroll in EasyPay or Pay Online, our account payment services, we will be required to validate your bank account information with your bank. &nbsp;If you request brochures, we may hire a third party fulfillment company to meet your request. &nbsp;We may share information about you with third party service providers (such as companies who assist us in conducting surveys and research to help us provide better products and services). &nbsp;However, your information is not shared with or sold to any other third party entity or individual for that entity or individual's independent use with the exception of when you request to be added to the fan mailing list of one of the participating Civic Tour bands and/or Civic Tour promotional partners or in situations where required by law, we may need to&nbsp;share this information with law enforcement officials such as in response to a court order or subpoena. &nbsp;American Honda Finance Corporation ("AHFC") customers are also encouraged to see the AHFC Financial Privacy Policy below to learn more about our protections and use of your nonpublic personal information (such as personally identifiable financial information). &nbsp;</p>

            <p>American Honda has reasonable security measures in place to protect your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;This information is protected while being transmitted through a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. &nbsp;Most web pages that display personally identifiable information are encrypted using 128-bit SSL, which is an industry standard. &nbsp;The following brands' brochure requests, however, are not transmitted through a SSL connection: &nbsp;Engine, Marine, and Power Equipment. &nbsp;In addition, the Motorcycle brand site does not currently transmit brochure and email notification requests through an SSL connection. &nbsp;In addition, we have security procedures and policies in place to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, and modification of this information after we receive it. &nbsp;However, perfect security does not exist over the internet. &nbsp;If you are an owners.honda.com/owners.acura.com&nbsp;registrant, you can help protect your personally identifiable information by selecting the "Log Out" icon before you close your browser.</p>
