            <p>We may request personally identifiable information in order to enhance your experience on our web sites. &nbsp;There are instances where American Honda requests personally identifiable information to provide the web site visitor a service or correspondence (such as promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is used to fulfill your request. The information you provide is used by American Honda to improve the services we provide you and to help us promote products and services that are of most interest to you. &nbsp;The information may be merged with other information American Honda already knows, such as whether you are an owner of a Honda or Acura vehicle.</p>
            <p>To use American Honda's Internet services, such as the Dealer Locator and brochure requests, we require a certain amount of personally identifying information such as name and address to meet your request. &nbsp;We may use this information to identify and access data in the existing relationship we have with you to provide you with the requested services. &nbsp;We may request email addresses as an alternate means of contacting you.</p>
            <p>
                <span style=" color: #ff0000;">We collect and use anonymous information</span>
            </p>
            <p>We may gather and store certain anonymous information about your visit, including the name of your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the type of browser and operating systems used to access our site, the date and time you access our site, the website that referred you to us, and the pages you visit (click-through). &nbsp;This information does not identify you personally. &nbsp;This information is collected and used to generate statistics, measure site activity, and improve the usefulness of our sites.</p>
            <p>
                <span style=" color: #ff0000;">Use of cookies</span>
            </p>
            <p>A "cookie" is a small text file or text identifier placed on your computer to assist us in providing customized services. &nbsp;We use cookies to provide you with a convenience feature to save you time and provide a more personalized experience on our site. &nbsp;For example, you may log on once during a visit and will be able to access multiple servers without having to log on again and again. &nbsp;We also use the information for internal research on our user's demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand our visitor's preferences. &nbsp;We may use cookies provided by ClearTrust, BrowserHawk, Capricorn Encryption, and WebTrends e-commerce software. &nbsp;You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. &nbsp;Some portions of our Web sites, such as Owner Link/My Acura, however, require the use of cookies for proper function.</p>

                <span style=" color: #ff0000;">Use of web beacons</span>
            </p>
            <p>A couple of our sites, such as Automobiles.Honda.com and Owner Link/My Acura, use web beacons also called single pixel gifs. &nbsp;Their use helps us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. &nbsp;Certain gif files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy. &nbsp;In short, web beacons collect only a limited amount of information including cookies and time and date of viewing and do not contain personally identifiable information. &nbsp;</p>

                <span style=" color: #ff0000;">Information use</span>
            </p>
            <p>The information you share with American Honda is used to improve the services we provide you and to provide services to you that you request. &nbsp;For example, if you enroll in EasyPay or Pay Online, our account payment services, we will be required to validate your bank account information with your bank. &nbsp;If you request brochures, we may hire a third party fulfillment company to meet your request. &nbsp;We may share information about you with third party service providers (such as companies who assist us in conducting surveys and research to help us provide better products and services). &nbsp;However, your information is not shared with or sold to any other third party entity or individual for that entity or individual's independent use with the exception of when you request to be added to the fan mailing list of one of the participating Civic Tour bands and/or Civic Tour promotional partners or in situations where required by law, we may need share this information with law enforcement officials such as in response to a court order or subpoena. &nbsp;American Honda Finance Corporation ("AHFC") customers are also encouraged to see the AHFC Financial Privacy Policy below to learn more about our protections and use of your nonpublic personal information (such as personally identifiable financial information). &nbsp;</p>

            </p>
            <p>American Honda has reasonable security measures in place to protect your personally identifiable information. &nbsp;This information is protected while being transmitted through a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) connection. &nbsp;Most web pages that display personally identifiable information are encrypted using 128-bit SSL, which is an industry standard. &nbsp;The following brands' brochure requests, however, are not transmitted through a SSL connection: &nbsp;Engine, Marine, and Power Equipment. &nbsp;In addition, the Motorcycle brand site does not currently transmit brochure and email notification requests through an SSL connection. &nbsp;In addition, we have security procedures and policies in place to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, and modification of this information after we receive it. &nbsp;However, perfect security does not exist over the internet. &nbsp;If you are an Owner Link/My Acura&nbsp;registrant, you can help protect your personally identifiable information by selecting the "Log Out" icon before you close your browser.</p>
