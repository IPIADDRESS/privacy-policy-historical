										<font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial">Thank you for visiting the Accurint</font><font size="2" color="black" face="Arial"><b><sup>®</sup></b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial"> web site. Accurint is committed to quality in all of its business operations, including maintaining the integrity of our data and the privacy of our customers. In furtherance of our commitment to our customers, we have implemented and abide by the following Privacy Policy in order to protect the privacy of all visitors to our web site.&nbsp; <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Scope<br>
											</b>This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us online while visiting or using our web site.&nbsp; It does not apply to information we have obtained offline or through other traditional means.&nbsp; If you have questions concerning our policies with respect to information we receive or collect other than through this web site, please contact us at the address below.&nbsp; <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>The Data that this Policy Covers<br>
											</b>Information you may provide in visiting our site falls into two broad categories: personally identifiable information and aggregate information. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, mailing address, or credit card information. "Aggregate Information" is information that does not identify you and may include, for example, statistical information concerning the web pages on our site that users most frequent. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Personally Identifiable Information<br>
											</b>Accurint does not use Personally Identifiable Information collected from our customers through this web site, whether order information or client information, for any purpose other than for conducting the Accurint services. We do not share with third parties any Personally Identifiable Information, except as needed to carry out the services you have requested.&nbsp; Accurint will at all times abide by federal and state laws and regulations in regard to Personally Identifiable Information collected from our web site. In addition, we have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot provide, and disclaim, assurance that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration through third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.<br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Aggregate Information<br>
											</b>We may collect Aggregate Information from our web site.&nbsp; This Information does not identify you.&nbsp; We may collect this type of Information through cookies and similar Internet technologies. "Cookies" are small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat users to facilitate the user’s ongoing access to and use of the site and to compile aggregate data to improve the site and focus advertising. If we use cookies, they do not collect or retain your name or other Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, no third parties are permitted to use cookies we may create at our site for their own purposes. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Changes to your Information<br>
											</b>We allow you to update, correct, or delete Personally Identifiable Information you have provided us. Accordingly, upon your reasonable request, and to the extent your request does not compromise our privacy policies, we will provide you with access to Personally Identifiable Information you have previously provided to us and allow you to update and correct this Information. In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or “opt-out of” -- certain online mailings and other online materials we may offer to our web site users.&nbsp; Finally, if you request, we will remove from our marketing databases your name and other Personally Identifiable Information which you have provided via this web site. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to change or delete the Personally Identifiable Information you have provided us via this web site, please contact us at the address listed below. &nbsp;Please further understand, as stated above, that this Privacy Policy does not govern use of the databases we employ to provide our services, and this Policy does not cover a data subject's request to remove or alter identifying information which is contained in these services-related databases and which we have obtained by means other than through this web site. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Data from Children<br>
											</b>Our site is not directed at children, and we will not accept or request personal information from individuals we know to be under 13. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, if we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, we will delete this information from our databases in accordance with our deletion policy set out above. For more information regarding a child under the age of 13 providing personal information to a web site, see the Federal Trade Commission’s web site explaining the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/</a>.<br>
											<br>
											<b>Exceptions<br>
											</b>There are two exceptions to this Privacy Policy. First, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information as may be required in legal proceedings or in response to a subpoena, court order, or administrative order compelling disclosure. Second, in cases involving a threat of imminent harm to you or others, we may release such Information to prevent or mitigate the threat. In any such case, we will seek to limit the scope of disclosure and will disclose only such Information as is reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure. <br>
											&nbsp;<br>
											<b>Your Consent<br>
											</b>By using our web site, you consent to our collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with some, or all, of the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from submitting such Information through our web site or from visiting our site. <br>
