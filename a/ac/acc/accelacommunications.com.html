<p>Accela Communications, Inc. has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to the confidentiality of customer data. Accela Communications, Inc. is a site for marketing professionals and channel partners and is a business unit of International Data Group. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for Accela Communications. We are committed to notify you of the following:  </p>
<ol>
<li>What personally identifiable information this web site collects from you and how the information is used. </li>
<li>With whom this site shares the information it collects. </li>
<li>How you can correct or make changes to this information. </li>

<br>
<b>IP Addresses</b> <br>
Our Web server automatically records a visitor's domain and IP address. We use the IP address to identify server problems and administer our Web site, and to analyze click-stream data to better understand user behavior.<br><br>

<b>What are cookies and how does Accela Communications use them?</b> <br>
Cookies are small files containing information that a Web site uses to track a visit. Both persistent and session cookies are used by Accela Communications. A persistent cookie remains on the user's hard drive for authentication purposes, while a session cookie is temporary and is only used to complete a registration process. (Please refer to your browser's Help function for further information on controlling and setting cookies.) Accela Communications requires session cookies to complete any registration processes we host. <br><br>
Accela Communications uses persistent cookies to link visitors to registration information that allows the system to confirm a user's identity and access level on the site. Accela Communications also uses that information to track service selections, deliver specific content, and save passwords to eliminate logging in each time a user visits the site. A password is encrypted within the persistent cookie and cannot be accessed by outside parties. A visitor may choose to reject a persistent cookie and use their login password each time they visit and/or select a service that requires authentication. Not all areas of our site require authentication. <br><br>

<b>What information does Accela Communications collect?</b> <br> 
Accela Communications collects optional data supplied by visitors through registration, surveys, sweepstakes, and contests, as well as information gathered from visitors via our server log. That information lets us better tailor our content to user interests. <br><br>

<b>How is our registration data used? </b> <br>
Accela Communications offers optional services that require registration. Customer contact information that is collected on behalf of Accela Communications is used to send relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. <br><br>
Personal information is also used to contact users for the administration of prizes and rewards or to respond to customer service requests. This data also enables Accela Communications to tailor visitors' experiences -- to show them content they might be interested in and display it according to their preferences. Unique identifiers, such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our database.<br><br>

<b>Accela Communications Webcast Data Collection:</b> <br> 
What personal information is collected? When you register to view an Accela Communications Webcast, we request personally identifiable information such as: email address, first name, last name, primary business activity, job function, company size, purchase plans and zip/postal code.<br><br>
Other information collected: Accela Communications's webcast application provides a "system test" that determines whether you can view a webcast from your computer. This test collects information such as platform/operating system, browser type/version, screen resolution, Real Media and Windows Media player information, Internet connection speed and whether Java, JavaScript and cookies are enabled. This information is used only to troubleshoot webcast viewing problems.<br><br>
In addition, your personally identifiable information may be gathered, processed or used by Accela Communications to authenticate you when you want to update your personal profile or to log on to select Accela Communications services; to support customer questions about the use of Accela Communications; to help you manage/modify your profile; to troubleshoot problems accessing your account, modifying your profile, changing your email preferences, etc. <br><br>
How do I access my personal information? Our registration systems are hosted at ITworld.com, a product of Accela Communications. You may update the information stored in your profile at any time while online by visiting here (<a href="http://www.itworld.com/newsletters/profile">http://www.itworld.com/newsletters/profile</a>). You will be prompted for your email address and password in order to access your profile. If you do not have a password you may  <a href="http://reg.itworld.com/servlet/Frs.frs?Script=request_password&amp;Context=START">request one here</a>.  <br><br>


If you have questions, you may also contact Accela Communications customer service by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy_support@accelacommunications.com">privacy_support@accelacommunications.com</a>.<br><br>

How do I control my personal information? You may review and update all of your information at any time while online by logging in to your personal profile. You control what Accela Communications information you have access to and the types of information that Accela Communications can send to you. For example, you have the opportunity to receive special offers/updates on behalf of Accela Communications or you can choose to opt out of these mailings at any time. See section below on Opt Out. <br><br>

<b>Log files</b> <br>
Accela Communications records Apache Web server logs in the extended log file format. We use server log data to help administer the site, to better understand the parts of the site and what types of content are most interesting to the audience, and to measure ongoing volume of traffic.<br><br> 
We sometimes link personally identifiable information to log click-stream data. We do so only to determine broad demographic trends and measure visitation patterns. We do not release this information.<br><br>
 
<b>Changes to this policy and notification of changes</b><br>
Accela Communications will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. The privacy policy will include the date that changes were last made to this document in a prominent location. Accela Communications encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how Accela Communications is protecting your information.<br><br>
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will take reasonable steps to notify users by posting a notice on our web site that our privacy policy has been updated. <br><br>

<b>Communications</b><br>
When you register for one of Accela Communications's services, you may receive any of the following electronic communications. Please note that this list is not all-inclusive and that many notifications require permission from the customer:<br>
<ul><li>Webcasts: registration confirmation and reminder notices prior to the event</li> 
<li>Promotional letters</li> </ul>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>
This site contains links to other Web sites. Accela Communications is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage our users to be aware of this when they leave our site and urge them to review the privacy statements of each Web site that collects personally identifiable information. The privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.<br><br>
 
<b>Surveys</b><br>
We occasionally run surveys in which participation is optional. We only ask participants for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information that pertains to their profession or professional interests. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary, or for the delivery of prizes or rewards. Users may opt out of receiving future survey mailings (please see the choice/opt-out section below). The survey data is only used in aggregate form and may be used to guide our editorial process or site-development process. <br><br>
 
<b>Security</b><br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information we control. Our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, audits of procedures, and regular reviews of overall Web security. Access to personal user data is also limited to the application developer (s), database administrator(s) and customer support personnel.  <br><br>
Accela Communications distributes a copy of its security policies and privacy practices to employees via email when any changes occur. All new employees are made aware of our security and privacy practices. A copy of the policy is also posted to an internal server. <br><br>
 
<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>
Customers may opt out of receiving future communications from Accela Communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of any email received from us. <br><br>
 
<b>Business Transfers</b><br>
In the unlikely event that Accela Communications, Inc, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.<br><br>
