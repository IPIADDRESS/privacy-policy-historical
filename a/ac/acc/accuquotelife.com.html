            <p>AccuQuote's database  contains information on hundreds of life insurance products offered by more  than 200 life insurance companies. Each company uses different criteria to rate  prospective customers. The information you provide on the quote request form,  combined with each insurance company's guidelines, allows us to accurately  determine which products and rate classes you'll likely be able to qualify for.  The consequence of declining to provide some of the requested information is  that the quotes you receive may be inaccurate, and/or that we may not be able  to provide a quote for you at all.</p>

            <p>Yes. All information  submitted through AccuQuote's quote request forms is stored in our database in Wheeling, Illinois  and/or printed and stored in files. AccuQuote does not use this information  except to process your request to provide quotes, or to forward it to an  insurance company, if and when you actually apply for coverage. This  information is securely stored at our company for a reasonable period of time  in order to make it easier and more convenient for you to apply should you not  decide to do so immediately. </p></td>

To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your  visits to other websites.

            <p>AccuQuote  uses your personal information to prepare an insurance quote for you. In the  future we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of the  AccuQuote web site with third parties. In this case, individual users' personal  information will not be identified. In the future we may share customer  information with our affiliated companies to offer customers other products or services  that may be of interest to them.</p>
            <p> In most  states, we may share customer information with companies not affiliated with us  so that those companies, such as insurance or financial service companies, may  also offer you financial products and services. However, you have the right to  tell us that you don’t want us to share any information with these companies.  You may “opt-out” at any time by sending us a written request by email, fax, or  mail. Even if you opt out, we may still disclose information as allowed or  required by law. </p>
            <p> When you fill  out our quote request form you are explicitly initiating a relationship with us  (as defined by the National Do Not Call Registry), inviting and consenting to  the receipt of information by AccuQuote and its affiliate partners (which may  be provided to you online, by fax, phone, email, US Mail, etc.) and, as such,  are indefinitely waiving any right to claim that we, or our affiliates,  contacted you without your express consent.

This may be done through one or more of many communication  channels (telephone, fax, email, US Mail, etc.) Once we have adequate  information to provide you with a reasonably accurate quote, we will prepare it  for you and you will receive it by fax, mail, phone, or email.

            <p>Spam or UCE,  Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, is the Internet version of "Junk  mail." It is an attempt to deliver a message to someone who would not  otherwise choose to receive it. Potential target lists for spamming are created  by scanning Usenet postings, stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the  Web for addresses. Such information is gathered with automated searches to  retrieve e-mail addresses for spamming.</p>
            <p> AccuQuote  does not spam. If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email address is  either listed with us as someone who expressly shared this address for the  purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you  have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with  us. By requesting information from us or receiving an online quote, which may  require future contact, you have agreed to opt-in to receiving our information.  We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our  mailings. </p></td>
