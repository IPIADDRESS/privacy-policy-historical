          <p class="header">WHY DOES ACCUQUOTE'S QUOTE  REQUEST FORM REQUIRE SO MUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
          <p>AccuQuote's database  contains information on hundreds of life insurance products offered by more  than 200 life insurance companies. Each company uses different criteria to rate  prospective customers. The information you provide on the quote request form,  combined with each insurance company's guidelines, allows us to accurately  determine which products and rate classes you'll likely be able to qualify for.  The consequence of declining to provide some of the requested information is  that the quotes you receive may be inaccurate, and/or that we may not be able  to provide a quote for you at all.</p>
          <p class="header">WHEN DO YOU SEND MY  INFORMATION TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY?</p>
          <p>AccuQuote will only send  your personal information to insurance companies when you choose to apply for  coverage or ask us to seek a preliminary opinion from an insurance carrier  regarding your potential insurability or lack thereof.</p>
          <p class="header">DOES ACCUQUOTE STORE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
          <p>Yes. All information  submitted through AccuQuote's quote request forms is stored in our database in Wheeling, Illinois  and/or printed and stored in files. AccuQuote does not use this information  except to process your request to provide quotes, or to forward it to an  insurance company, if and when you actually apply for coverage. This  information is securely stored at our company for a reasonable period of time  in order to make it easier and more convenient for you to apply should you not  decide to do so immediately. </p>
          <p class="header">DOES ACCUQUOTE USE COOKIES? </p>
          <p>Yes, some of AccuQuote's  pages do use "cookies" - one or more small text files saved on your  computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running.  AccuQuote stores this number as a cookie in order to track usage patterns.  Cookies are totally harmless and do not hurt your computer in any way, nor do  they compromise your identity or provide us any other information other than  what you, as the potential customer, willingly supply to us. We may also use  third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies  may also use cookies and action tags to measure and improve the effectiveness  of ads. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your  visits to other websites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad  shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This  information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes.</p>
          <p class="header">HOW DOES ACCUQUOTE USE MY INFORMATION ? </p>
          <p>AccuQuote  uses your personal information to prepare an insurance quote for you. In the  future we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of the  AccuQuote web site with third parties. In this case, individual users' personal  information will not be identified. In the future we may share customer  information with our affiliated companies to offer customers other products or services  that may be of interest to them.</p>
          <p> In most  states, we may share customer information with companies not affiliated with us  so that those companies, such as insurance or financial service companies, may  also offer you financial products and services. However, you have the right to  tell us that you don’t want us to share any information with these companies.  You may “opt-out” at any time by sending us a written request by email, fax, or  mail. Even if you opt out, we may still disclose information as allowed or  required by law. </p>
          <p> When you fill  out our quote request form you are explicitly initiating a relationship with us  (as defined by the National Do Not Call Registry), inviting and consenting to  the receipt of information by AccuQuote and its affiliate partners (which may  be provided to you online, by fax, phone, email, US Mail, etc.) and, as such,  are indefinitely waiving any right to claim that we, or our affiliates,  contacted you without your express consent. At any time we will immediately  honor any request to be placed on our internal "do not contact" list.</p>
          <p class="header">AFTER I REQUEST QUOTES AT ACCUQUOTE, WHO WILL CONTACT ME ?</p>
          <p>You may be contacted by one  of our people to clarify some of the information you provide to us on your  quote request form. This may be done through one or more of many communication  channels (telephone, fax, email, US Mail, etc.) Once we have adequate  information to provide you with a reasonably accurate quote, we will prepare it  for you and you will receive it by fax, mail, phone, or email. By submitting  your information, you also agree to receive other money saving or financially  beneficial offers from AccuQuote and Trusted 3rd Parties in the future.</p>
          <p class="header">WILL YOU CONTACT ME IF I'M ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY?</p>
          <p>We do not wish to make  contact with individuals or companies that are not interested in receiving  information or entertaining the possibility of obtaining insurance through our  firm. When you fill out our quote request form you are explicitly initiating a  relationship with us, inviting and consenting to the receipt of information  (which may be provided to you online, by fax, phone, email, US Mail, etc.) and,  as such, are waiving any right (including claims under the Telemarketing Sales  Rule) extending in perpetuity to claim that we contacted you without your  express consent. At any time we will immediately honor any request to be placed  on our internal "do not contact" list. </p>
          <p class="header">WHAT IS YOUR POLICY ON SPAMMING?</p>
          <p>Spam or UCE,  Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, is the Internet version of "Junk  mail." It is an attempt to deliver a message to someone who would not  otherwise choose to receive it. Potential target lists for spamming are created  by scanning Usenet postings, stealing Internet mailing lists, or searching the  Web for addresses. Such information is gathered with automated searches to  retrieve e-mail addresses for spamming.</p>
          <p> AccuQuote  does not spam. If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email address is  either listed with us as someone who expressly shared this address for the  purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or (b) you  have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with  us. By requesting information from us or receiving an online quote, which may  require future contact, you have agreed to opt-in to receiving our information.  We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our  mailings. </p>
          <p class="header">HOW CAN I STOP RECEIVING EMAIL FROM YOU?</p>
          <p>Each email sent contains an  easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or to change your  expressed interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at  the end of any email. If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via  this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of  that email with your comments to <a href="mailto:%20pr@accuquote.com">pr@accuquote.com</a> for review.</p>
          <p class="header">HOW TO CONTACT US?</p>
          <p>Should you have other  questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:%20pr@accuquote.com">pr@accuquote.com</a>.</p>
