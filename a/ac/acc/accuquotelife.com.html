At AccuQuote, we take your privacy seriously. We believe you have the right to know the privacy policies of the sites you visit. 
<p>
<span class="subhead">How does AccuQuote use my information?</span><br>
AccuQuote uses your personal information to prepare an insurance quote for you. Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, AccuQuote does not willfully use or disclose individual information to third parties, other than as necessary to facilitate the process of obtaining insurance for you. However, in the future we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of the AccuQuote web site with third parties. Even in this case, individual users' personal information will not be identified. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">When do you send my information to an insurance company?</span><br>
AccuQuote will send your personal information to insurance companies only if and when you choose to apply for coverage, or when you ask us to seek a preliminary opinion from an insurance carrier regarding your potential insurability or lack thereof. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">Why does AccuQuote's quote request form require so much personal information?</span><br>
AccuQuote's database contains information on over 1,100 life insurance products offered by hundreds of life insurance companies. Each company uses different criteria to rate prospective customers. The information you provide on the quote request form, combined with each insurance company's guidelines allows us to accurately determine which products and rate classes you'll likely be able to qualify for. The consequence of declining to provide some of the requested information is that the quotes you receive may be inaccurate, and/or that we may not be able to provide a quote for you at all. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">After I request quotes at AccuQuote, who will contact me?</span><br>
You may be contacted by one of our people to clarify some of the information you provide to us on your quote request form. Once we have adequate information to provide you with a reasonably accurate quote, we will prepare it for you and you will receive it by fax, mail, phone, or email. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">Does AccuQuote sell my information to other companies?</span><br>
No. AccuQuote does not resell, trade, lease or rent the personal information of our customers to other companies. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">Does AccuQuote store my personal information?</span><br>
Yes. All information submitted through AccuQuote's quote request forms is stored in our computers in Northbrook, Illinois and/or printed and stored in files. AccuQuote does not use this information except to process your request to provide quotes, or to forward it to an insurance company if and when you actually apply for coverage. This information is securely stored at our company for a reasonable period of time in order to make it easier and more convenient for you to come back. 
</p><p>
<span class="subhead">Does AccuQuote use "cookies"?</span><br>
Yes, some of AccuQuote's pages do use "cookies" - one or more small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. AccuQuote stores this number as a cookie on the user's computer in order to track usage patterns. Cookies are totally harmless and can't hurt your computer in any way.
