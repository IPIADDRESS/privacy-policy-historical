<b>Privacy Policy</b> - Last Modified January 21, 2005

<p><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.accoona.com&amp;sealid=101" target="_blank"><img src="/themes/accoonacom/images/logo_truste.gif" width="91" height="73" alt="TRUSTe Logo" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10"></a>This website (the "Site") is owned and operated by Accoona Corp. Accoona Corp and our subsidiary companies worldwide (collectively, "Accoona" or "we") are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. Accoona has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the Site and how we may use that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site (including Accoona's search engine and any other services offered on the Site), you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or our services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect on the Site (or otherwise through our search engine) and does not apply to information which we may collect by other means.</p>

<p align="justify">This website (the "Site") is owned and operated by Accoona Corp.
Accoona Corp and our subsidiary companies worldwide (collectively,
"Accoona" or "we") are committed to respecting your online
privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of
any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you
share with us. Accoona has established this Privacy Policy to let you know what
information we may collect from you on the Site and how we may use that
information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By
using the Site (including Accoona's search engine and any other services
offered on the Site), you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If
you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the
Site or our services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that we
collect on the Site (or otherwise through our search engine) and does not apply
to information which we may collect by other means.</p>

<p>Personal Information</p>

<p><u>Information We May Collect</u></p>

<p align="justify">Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an
individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or
other physical address and an email address. In general, you can visit the Site
and use its search engine and other features without telling us who you are or
revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, in order to access
certain information, services or features contained on the Site, we may require
you to provide Personal Information. For example, we will collect certain
Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to our mailing list or send
questions or comments to us via e-mail.</p>

<p><u>How We May Use Your Information</u></p>

<p align="justify">If you provide us with Personal Information, we may retain and use that
information for several purposes. For example, we may use your Personal
Information in order to process and fulfill any transactions or services that
you request, such as responding to your questions or sending e-mails to our
mailing list subscribers. We may also use Personal Information to ensure
compliance with our policies and applicable law. In addition, we may send you
periodic communications by e-mail or regular mail, such as special offers or
information on our services. If you wish to opt out of receiving e-mail
communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions for doing so
in the e-mails that you receive from us. If you need any further assistance,
you can contact us at the following page: 
<a href="/about/contact_us.jsp">http://www.accoona.com/about/contact_us.jsp</a></p>

<p><u>With Whom We May Share Your Information</u></p>

<p align="justify">If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information on the Site, we
may transfer that information within Accoona. We may store and process Personal
Information collected on our Site in the United States or any other country in
which Accoona or its agents maintain facilities. By using our Site and
services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these
facilities, including those located outside your country. Third parties provide
certain services available on the Site on Accoona's behalf. For example,
Service providers are an important means by which Accoona maintains the Site and
our mailing lists. Accoona may provide information, including Personal
Information that Accoona collects on the Site, to third-party service providers
to help us deliver programs, products, information, and services. Accoona will
take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are
obligated to protect Personal Information on Accoona's behalf.</p>

<p align="justify">As Accoona develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our
business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets
involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Accoona or all of its
assets are acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred
assets.</p>

<p align="justify">We reserve the right to disclose visitor information in special cases when
we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our
rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such
activities. We also reserve the right to disclose visitor information when we
believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>

<p align="justify">Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not currently intend to
share your Personal Information with any third parties without obtaining your
consent. However, we may decide to do so in the future, in which case we will
update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

<p>Aggregate Information</p>

<p align="justify">From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical
information about the use of the Site and our search engine, such as how many
visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page,
and which search results or other hyperlinks, if any, they "click"
on. We collect this information through the use of "cookies" and
other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We
collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site, search
terms and search results are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors.
We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to
describe the use of the Site and our search engine to our existing or potential
business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response
to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data
will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to the Site.</p>

<p><u>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</u></p>

<p align="justify">Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking
technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an
individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies may be used, for
example, to collect information about website activity. Most browsers allow you
to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove
them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you
may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that
some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if you
refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other
third parties with links on the Site. We do not control these cookies. The use
of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet
industry. We do not link the
information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you
submit while on our site.</p>

<p align="justify">Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and
host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating
system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is
accessed. We do not link the information we record using tracking technologies
to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p>Search Engine</p>

<p align="justify">When you use our search engine, we may collect certain non-personally
identifiable information through the use of cookies and other tracking
technologies described above. For example, when you use our search engine, we
may keep track of which search terms are popular. If we display advertising to
you on the Site (including the search results pages displayed after any
searches you may run), such advertising may be related to the search terms you
entered. Accoona may present search result links in a format that enables us to
understand whether they have been followed and may monitor click-throughs on an
individual and an aggregate basis. We use this information to understand and
improve the quality of Accoona's search technology. For instance, this data
helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a
query and how often they proceed to later results.</p>

<p align="justify">Certain search results may be "premium" results, which consist of
websites who have paid for placement in the search results. These listings are
provided by our business partner, Overture Services, which is a subsidiary of
Yahoo. These premium results may contain tracking URLs provided by Overture to
identify clicks from the search results page. Again, information gathered by
these means will not personally identify you. Any information collected by
Overture will be subject to Overture's privacy policy, and Overture and Accoona
may share information that either company gathers in connection with the use of
Accoona's search engine.</p>

<p>Links to Other Sites</p>

<p align="justify">Please be aware that when you are on the Site, you could be directed to
other sites that are beyond our control. For example, when you use our search
engine, the search results will provide links to other sites from the Site's
pages that take you outside the Site. These other sites may send their own
cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit Personal Information. The privacy
policies of these other sites may be significantly different from this Privacy
Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites
and cannot guarantee the security of any of your Personal Information collected
there.</p>

<p>Security</p>

<p align="justify">Wherever your Personal Information may be held within Accoona or on its
behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the
Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or
disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security
of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your
Personal Information.</p>

<p>Updating Your Information</p>

<p align="justify">To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Accoona
wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. If we collect Personal
Information from you on the Web, you may send updates and corrections about
your Personal Information to <a href="mailto:privacy@accoona.com">privacy@accoona.com</a>
and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Personal
Information that we hold as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>Children's Privacy</p>

<p align="justify">Accoona.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not
knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If
you are under the age of 13, please do not provide any Personal Information to
us.</p>

<p>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</p>

<p align="justify">The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time without prior
notice to you, so please check this page periodically for any changes. By
checking the "Last Modified" date above, you can determine if this
Privacy Policy has been updated since your last visit to the Site. Your
continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will
mean you accept those changes.</p>

<p>Governing Law</p>

<p align="justify">This Privacy Policy and the privacy practices of Accoona will be subject
exclusively to the laws of the State of New York within the United States of America. 
Accoona makes no representation that this Privacy Policy and such
practices comply with the laws of any other country. Visitors who use the Site,
the search engine or any other services offered on the Site and reside outside
the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for
compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

<p>TRUSTe Privacy Program</p>

<p align="justify">Accoona Corp. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build
user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair
information practices. This privacy statement covers the site 
<a href="http://www.accoona.com/">http://www.accoona.com</a>.
Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it
has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices
reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

<p align="justify">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact John Fernandez 
at <a href="mailto:privacy@accoona.com">privacy@accoona.com</a>.
If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not
been satisfactorily address, you should contact TRUSTe at 
<a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p>Contacting Us</p>

<p align="justify">If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@accoona.com">privacy@accoona.com</a>, or

we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.</p>
