			<p><strong>ACCESS HOLLYWOOD<br>
Syndicated, check local listings</strong><br>
              <br>
NBC Universal respects the privacy concerns of the visitors to its sites on the  Internet. This privacy statement governs all NBC Universal sites, and was  created to explain what information we gather from your visit to any of the NBC  Universal sites and how such information may be used. This privacy policy does  not govern sites that are operated by MSN, IBS or any third party, which  include MSNBC.com, NBC's owned or operated station sites, CNBC.com and  ShopNBC.com. While this privacy statement is meant to educate you on how NBC  Universal uses information obtained from its sites, it is not a substitute for  each NBC Universal web site's own policy or any third party site's policy that  is linked to from any of our sites. It is your responsibility to carefully  review the specific privacy policies posted on these sites as each may have  different privacy policies and practices.<br>
<br>
<strong>NBC Universal's Use of Information:</strong> NBC Universal uses both personal and  aggregated data we collect from our sites for multiple purposes. The  information may be used to improve the content of the sites, to customize the  content and layout of the sites for each individual user and to notify users  about updates to the sites or promotional offers or opportunities that we  believe will be of interest to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Data:</strong> Personal data is collected when users provide personal  contact information to NBC Universal sites. For example, in registering for  electronic newsletters or other membership services, in answering surveys,  purchasing items from NBC Universal sites, and registering for contests and  other promotional opportunities provided by NBC Universal and its partners, NBC  Universal sites may ask you to provide personally identifiable information such  as name, address, birth-date or email address. We also ask users to provide  personal data such as e-mail addresses when posting messages to our message  boards and chat areas. Aggregated Data: Aggregated information, or non-personal  information, such as browser type, operating system, IP address, pages  accessed, is collected through various methods. For example, NBC Universal  sites may use cookies or collect IP addresses in order to enhance your online  experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies:</strong> Cookies are pieces of information that a web site  transfers to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping purposes.  Cookies make using our sites easier by, among other things, saving your  passwords and preferences for you. As an example, we use cookies to keep track  of your shopping cart when you visit our online store, and help identify you  when you return to the Store. These cookies are restricted for use only on our  sites, and do not transfer any personal information to any other party. Most  browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can reset your  browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. (Note:  you will need to consult the help area of your browser application for  instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to  accept a cookie, some parts of NBC Universal's web sites will not function  properly or may be considerably slower. For example, without cookies, you will  not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty  completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of IP Addresses:</strong> An IP address is a number that's automatically  assigned to your computer by your Internet provider whenever you're surfing the  Web. When you request pages from NBC Universal sites, our servers log your IP  address. NBC Universal collects IP addresses for the purposes of system  administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to  audit the use of our Site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally  identifiable, which means that your session will be logged, but you are  anonymous to us. We may use your IP addresses in cooperation with your Internet  provider to identify you if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with  our Terms of Use or to protect our service, sites, customers, or others.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing Personal Data:</strong> NBC Universal may share personal and aggregated  information with pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional or  fulfillment purposes. For example, we will share your personal information, on  a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on  our behalf, such as sending e-mails, processing orders or credit card payments,  or fulfilling orders for products and/or services. You may always opt-out of  receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-out section below. The contact  information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your  order. Financial information that is collected is used to process your request  for products and services, and will not be shared with third parties who are  not involved with the transaction. When credit card information is transmitted  we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.<br>
<br>
NBC Universal may disclose user information in special cases when we have  reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,  contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or  interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with NBC Universal's  rights or property, other NBC Universal web site users, or anyone else that  could be harmed by such activities. NBC Universal may also share information  with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge  personal information if such information is subpoenaed. From time to time, NBC  Universal may purchase a business or transfer or sell one of our businesses,  along with the accompanying site. Should such an event occur, customer  information may of course be one of the transferred assets, and such customer  information will be dealt with in accordance with applicable law.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing Aggregate Data:</strong> NBC Universal may also share aggregate data with  third party companies to provide services or targeted advertising on our sites.  For example, NBC Universal may use third party advertising companies to serve  ads when you visit our sites. These companies may use non-personally  identifiable information about your visits to our sites and to other Web sites  in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and  services of interest to you. For this purpose, NBC Universal and our third  party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our sites  through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).<br>
<br>
<strong>Security:</strong> Security for all personally identifiable information is  extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to  protect your personal information, NBC Universal cannot ensure or warrant the  security of any information you transmit to us or that you find on our online  products or services. You use such information at your own risk. Once we  receive your transmission, we make best efforts consistent with reasonable  commercial practices to ensure its security on our systems.<br>
<br>
<strong>For Parents Concerning Privacy:</strong> NBC Universal encourages parents and  guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar  with the sites visited by their children. At various places on NBC Universal  web sites, NBC Universal will ask whether users are under the age of 18, or 13,  and then ask for parental consent. While NBC Universal requests this  information or permission, NBC Universal relies on users to be truthful in  responding to these questions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Coppa Compliance and Individuals Under 13:</strong> NBC Universal complies with  COPPA and requires that users under the age of 13 years should not submit to or  post on any NBC Universal sites without the consent of their parent or legal  guardian. Personal contact information knowingly obtained from a child under 13  will not be disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of  that child's parent or legal guardian. Depending on the type of information  requested and the nature of the activity for which a child is registering, NBC  Universal may require that a parent or legal guardian email or fax their  permission to NBC Universal. In the event a user under the age of 13  participates in a contest or promotional opportunity offered by a NBC Universal  site and wins, then NBC Universal will obtain verifiable consent from the  user's parent or legal guardian.<br>
<br>
<strong>Message Boards and Chat:</strong> Guests of NBC Universal sites are solely  responsible for the content of messages they post on public forums, such as chat  rooms and bulletin boards. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily  disclose personal information (e.g. user name, e-mail address, phone number) on  the bulletin board or in the chat room that this information can be collected  and used by others. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should  be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information  while using chat rooms or message boards. Users of chat rooms and message  boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages  online.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Other sites:</strong> NBC Universal is not responsible for the content  or practices of third party web sites that may be linked to our sites. Our  sites may also be linked to web sites operated by other companies. Visitors to  these web sites should refer to each web site's respective privacy policies and  practices.<br>
<br>
<strong>Choice/Opt-Out:</strong> During your visit to any NBC Universal site, each site  may provide you the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications on various  products or services or upcoming events. You always have the option of removing  your name from any e-mail list to not receive future communications. In order  to ensure immediate removal from any list, it is best to follow the specific  instructions outlined within the communications you receive from us or those  outlined on a site's particular registration pages since NBC Universal operates  numerous sites tailored to specific interests. However, if you are unable to  complete the process indicated in the communications, then you can discontinue  your subscription to any of the e-mailings listed on the page entitled  "<a href="http://nbcuni.com/Newsletter/" target="_blank" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://nbcuni.com/Newsletter/_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">Sign Up For Our Newsletters</a>"

<br>
By clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link above, you may opt-out of receiving future communications by checking any box or boxes on the page and then hitting submit.<br>
<br>
<strong>Questions:</strong><br>
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or any matter pertaining to  the use of your personal information on this site, other than how to opt-out  from mailings, please send an e-mail to the address located at the site upon  which you provided the personal information, for example, <a href="http://www.accesshollywood.com" onclick="s_objectID=&quot;http://www.accesshollywood.com/_1&quot;;return this.s_oc?this.s_oc(e):true">AccessHollywood.com</a>. </p>
			<p><strong>Your Acceptance of These Terms:</strong> By using NBC Universal's sites, you signify your  acceptance of the NBC Universal's Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of any  of the particular NBC Universal site you visit. If you do not agree to this  policy, please do not use our sites. NBC Universal reserves the right to  modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time, so visitors are  encouraged to review this policy from time to time. Your continued use of the  NBC Universal sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean  you accept those changes.<br>
