<p>Thank you for visiting the Access Board's website and
reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect <strong>no</strong>
personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to
provide that information to us. Here is how we handle information about
your visit to our website:</p>

<h3>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h3>

<p>You do not have to give us personal information to visit
our site. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the
website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain
information about your visit automatically. This information does <strong>not</strong>
identify you personally. We automatically collect and store <strong>only</strong> the
following information about your visit:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com"
if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu"
if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is
a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are
surfing the Web) from which you access our website;</li>
<li>the type of browser (including brand and version) and
operating system used to access our site;</li>
<li>the date and time you accessed our site and the amount
of time spent on our site;</li>
<li>the pages you visited; and</li>
<li>if you linked to our website from another website or
through a search engine, the address of that website or the name of search
engine.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information to make our site more useful to
visitors and to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the
types of technology our visitors use. We do <strong>not</strong> track or record
information about individuals and their visits.</p>

<h3>If You Send Us Personal Information</h3>

<p>Our website permits you to send us information through
several on-line forms. These forms allow you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>sign up to receive our free newsletter by mail or by e-mail (<a href="news/Access%20Currents/General.cfm">see form</a>);</li>
<li>order publications  (<a href="po1.cfm">see form</a>); or</li>
<li>file a complaint under the Architectural Barriers Act (<a href="enforcement/form-email.htm">see form</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Forms for subscribing to our mailed newsletter request the
necessary mailing information. This information is entered into an Access
Board database used only for the distribution of Board publications. Forms
to receive our newsletter by e-mail or e-mail news updates request an e-mail
address. This information is added to e-mail distribution lists maintained
by the Board and used only for these purposes.
We do not request or store any information other than the mailing or e-mailing
information requested in our forms. The Board
does not collect information for commercial marketing.</p>

<p>The Access Board is responsible for enforcing the Architectural Barriers Act
(ABA), which requires access to facilities designed, built, altered, or
leased with Federal funds. The Board enforces this law through the
investigation of complaints filed by the public about the lack of access to a
facility. Our enforcement regulations prohibit us from disclosing the
identity of complainants without their written permission.We do not create individual profiles
with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations.</p>

<p>The only other means of submitting information to us is by
sending us an e-mail message. A posted <a href="contact.htm">e-mail directory</a> lists the
various Access Board mailboxes noted on our website. If you choose to
provide us with personal information in an e-mail message, we will use such
information only to respond to your message and to get you the information you
have requested. However, comments which are e-mailed to the Board in
response to notices of proposed rulemaking are placed in a docket for public
inspection at the Board’s office and may be posted on the Board’s website as
well.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>Our website has links to many other Federal agencies and
non-commercial sites. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the
privacy policy of the other site. See our <a href="links.htm">directory</a>
of links to other sites.</p>

privacy policy, contact our <a href="mailto:webmaster@access-board.gov">webmaster</a> (e-mail) or call (202) 272-0080 (voice) or (202) 272-0082 (TTY).</p>
