<p>The Access Board is responsible for enforcing the Architectural Barriers Act
(ABA), which requires access to&nbsp; facilities designed, built, altered, or
leased with Federal funds.&nbsp; The Board enforces this law through the
investigation of complaints filed by the public about the lack of access to a
facility.&nbsp; Our enforcement regulations prohibit us from disclosing the
identity of complainants without their written permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial">We do not create individual profiles
with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The only other means of submitting information to us is by
sending us an e-mail message.&nbsp; A posted <b><a href="email-directory.htm">e-mail directory</a></b> lists the
various Access Board mailboxes noted on our website.&nbsp; If you choose to
provide us with personal information in an e-mail message, we will use such
information only to respond to your message and to get you the information you
have requested.&nbsp; However, comments which are e-mailed to the Board in
response to notices of proposed rulemaking are placed in a docket for public
inspection at the Board’s office and may be posted on the Board’s website as
well.</font> </p>
