				<br class="Spacer8">
				When you subscribe to AccessMedicine services (including <i>AccessLANGE,</i> <i>Harrison's
				Online,</i> <i>Hurst's the Heart,</i> and <i>CMDT Online</i>) or register for a trial
				subscription, we collect certain personal information, such as your name, address, and e-mail
				address. We use this information to process your order and for administration of your
				subscription. Your e-mail address is added to our electronic mailing list so that, from
				time to time, we can send you information about new features, additions, and changes to
				our Web site. If you do not want to receive e-mail alerts, you may indicate this on your
				registration form, and you can change this at any time by going to the Subscriber Services
				section and selecting "Edit your registration information." Also, AccessMedicine may
				occasionally make subscriber information available to other units within The McGraw-Hill
				Companies as well as to selected outside companies whose products or services we feel
				may be of interest to you. Your information is stored in a secure database in the U.S. and access is limited to authorized persons.<br>
				<br class="Spacer8">
				AccessMedicine makes use of a type of cookie called a "session" cookie. Cookies are
				small bits of data that we send to your computer. We use them to improve your user
				experience. We use them to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so that you
				don't have to continually enter your user name and password as you move around the site.
				This type of cookie is removed as soon as you log out or close your browser.<br>
				<br class="Spacer8">
				In order to change these cookie preferences, you must change your browser's preferences 
				to disable cookies or delete cookies. Please note that disabling cookies for some services 
				may affect the ability to use that service. Security information is specific to each 
				browser and operating system. <b>Please check with your browser's specific company for more 
				information</b>. Some examples of how to change your browser's preferences are as follows: 
				In Internet Explorer (versions 6 and up), this option is listed under Tools &gt; Internet 
				Options &gt; Privacy. The setting has to be set to <b>Block All Cookies</b>; In Netscape 
				(versions 7 and up), this option is listed under Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy &amp; 
				Security &gt; Cookies. The <b>Disable Cookies</b> button should be checked.<br> 
				<br class="Spacer8">
				An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're
				surfing the Web. Web servers—the big computers that "serve up" Web
				pages—automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses
				for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our
				institutional customers, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request
				pages from AccessMedicine, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally
				link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's
				session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP
				addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our
				house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.<br>
				<br class="Spacer8">
				Please be assured that we take your concerns about privacy quite seriously, and we
				intend to take every reasonable effort to protect it. To that end, The McGraw-Hill
				Companies has developed a comprehensive customer privacy policy. If you'd like more
				information about our use of customer data, please review
				<a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html" target="new">The McGraw-Hill
				Companies Customer Privacy Policy</a>.<br>
				<br class="Spacer8">
				If you have questions or comments about our customer privacy policy or you would
				like to confirm the accuracy of the information collected from you, please write:
