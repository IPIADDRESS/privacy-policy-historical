<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
