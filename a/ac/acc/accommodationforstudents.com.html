<b>4. International transfers of your personal data&nbsp;</b><br>

<br>
<b>6. Amendments&nbsp;</b><br>

<br>
<span>6.3 We may notify you of changes to this policy

<br>
<br>
<b>7. Your rights</b><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span>7.1 In this Section 7, we have summarised the
rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex,
and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly,
you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities
for a full explanation of these rights.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span>7.2 Your principal rights under data protection
law are:&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (a) the right to access;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (b) the right to rectification;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (c) the right to erasure;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (d) the right to restrict processing;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (e) the right to object to processing;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (f) the right to data portability;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (g) the right to complain to a supervisory
authority; and&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>- (h) the right to withdraw consent.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span>7.3 You have the right to confirmation as to
whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the
personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional
information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories
of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing
the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a
copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but
additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can access your
personal data by emailing&nbsp;</span></span><u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
"><a href="mailto:support@accommodationforstudents.com"><span>support@accommodationforstudents.com</span></a></span></u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
"><br>
<br>
<span>7.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate
personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the
processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span>7.5 In some circumstances you have the right to
the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances
include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to
consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of
applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing
purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there
are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where
processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
exercise or defence of legal claims.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span>7.6 In some circumstances you have the right to
restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you
contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing,
but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of
that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may

the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us;
or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information

<br>
<span>7.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our
processing of your personal data is:&nbsp;</span><br>

withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
processing before the withdrawal.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
