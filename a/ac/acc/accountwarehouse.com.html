                    The AccountWarehouse.com website and all other related services are
    products of AccountWarehouse.com, LLC, a Texas limited liability company
    (“AccountWarehouse.com,” “we,” or “us”). We take your privacy very
    seriously. How we will handle information we learn about you depends upon
what you do when using the website located at    <a href="http://www.accountwarehouse.com/">www.AccountWarehouse.com</a>
                    (“Site”). We strive to make all choices you (“you,” “User,” or “Users”)
    make while using our Site as transparent as possible. We also hold the
    security of your personal information as our top priority. This policy will
    cover personally identifiable information and other information that may or
    may not be anonymous that you provide us through use of the Site (“Privacy
    Policy”). All other information given to us is outside the scope of this
    policy. This policy will explain what information is collected, how that
    information is used and/or shared, how the information is protected, and
    how you can control your privacy while using the service. We reserve the
    right to make changes to this policy at any time and will update these
    terms on our website when we do so.

                <p>
                    In administering the Site, we may collect your Personal Information and
    non-Personal Information. Personal Information is information, that by its
    very nature, can be tracked back to you (“Personal Information”). Some
    example of this type of information includes your name, address, email
    address, and billing information. Non-Personal Information, on the other
    hand, is information that is considered insufficient to be able linked back
    to the original User.<strong></strong>

                <p>
                    On the Site, all transactions are performed as if you are a guest and you
    do not need to create an account. To facilitate these transactions,
    however, you will be required to enter certain Personal Information
    including, but not limited to, your name, email address, address, billing
    information, game profile username, and game profile password. You may also
    screenshots, notes, and other similar information during regular use of the
    Site.

                    Like other websites or apps, we also may collect and store information that
    is generated automatically as you navigate through our Site. We may collect
    information about your visit from the browser on your computer or mobile
    device including but not limited to the time and date you access the Site,
    IP address, cookies, and the pages you request — to analyze trends,
    administer the Site, track navigation of the site, deliver relevant
    advertisements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use
    (note that IP addresses are not linked to Personal Information). We use
    this information to improve understanding of customer needs and provide
    relevant services. To automatically collect information, we use various
    technologies including:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cookies. Cookies are small data files that a website you visit may save on
    your hard drive that usually includes an anonymous unique identifier. The
    cookie does not personally identify the user; it merely identiﬁes the
    computer with which the user accesses the Site. Unless a user voluntarily
    identiﬁes himself or herself (through registration, for example), the Site
    will not be able to ascertain the identity of the user, even if a cookie is
    assigned to a user’s computer. The only personal information a cookie can
    contain is information supplied by a user. A cookie cannot retrieve any
    other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your
    e-mail address. The Site uses cookies for user authentication, keeping
    track of your preferences, promotional campaigns that require user
    identification, keeping track of our audience size and traffic patterns,
    and in certain other cases. You can configure your browser to accept
    cookies, reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being used; however,
    if you do so it may render your computer unable to take advantage of the
    personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Site. Cookies allow us
    to provide better security on the Site, to customize the content, to track
    purchases, and to keep the Site working properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pixel Tags. We use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web
    beacons or Web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique
    identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online
    movements of web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a
    computer’s hard drive or web browser, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in
    web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format that
    users can read, and tell us whether emails have been opened to, in part,
    ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
    We may also use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a
    user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Log File Information. When you use AccountWarehouse.com, our servers may
    automatically record certain information that your device sends whenever
    you visit any website and use certain apps. These server logs may include
    information such as your web or app request, Internet Protocol ("IP")
    address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs,
    platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed
    and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages,
    the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may
    uniquely identify your browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Threat Detection. We use certain third party service providers to provide
    threat detection, user authentication and fraud prevention services. These
    service providers may automatically collect certain information about your
    visits to the Site and the device you use to connect to our Site, in order
    to monitor for potential threats or bad actors. This information may
    include, among other things, your IP address and your device’s unique
    device identifier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Information Collected from Other Sources. We may supplement the information
    we have about you with information received from other sources including
    from our pages on social networking sites, the social networking sites
    themselves, and from commercially available sources (e.g., data brokers and
    public databases). The information we receive may include demographic data
    such as age, gender and income level, your interests and purchase data and
    other information that is necessary or useful to assist our marketing
    efforts or for user verification, authentication, fraud detection or to
    comply with regulatory requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third Party Analytics. We use a number of third party service providers,
such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use our services ("    <strong>Analytics Companies</strong>"). These Analytics Companies use
    Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Site, what
    pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our
    Site. We use the information we get from Analytics Companies only to
    improve our Site.

    when it’s necessary to provide services (like when we partner with payment
    processors or other data services). When we share data with third-party
