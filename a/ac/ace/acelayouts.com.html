<p>This privacy policy covers how we treat personal information that we collect
and receive. We do not intend to collect any personal information from children
under 13 unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law. Please see
below for our policy with respect to children <span class="GramE">under</span>
13. </p>

<p><strong>General</strong> <br>
We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our
site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and
advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you
to register or to provide personal information when you post comments, enter a
contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas
of our site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas
that require personal identification. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Use of Information </strong><br>
<br>
Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a
cookie is sent. A “<span class="SpellE">cookie<span class="GramE">?is</span></span>
a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping
purposes and to help us provide better service to you. We use cookies to save
your password (in an encrypted format) on your machine so you don't have to
re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to deliver
content specific to your interests and track your downloads and purchases from
our site. </p>

<p><br>
We use companies [Google <span class="GramE">( Google.com</span> ) <span class="SpellE">ValueClick</span> ( ValueClickMedia.com ) <span class="SpellE">AdBrite</span>
(AdBrite.com) ] to serve the advertisements on some of our pages. These
companies and advertisers may place and access their cookies on your computer.
Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies,
not ours. We may use your information or allow advertisers or companies that
serve advertisements access to your information to determine which
advertisements you will see. This information may include your demographic
information, geographic location, what content you access on our site, how you
rate <span class="GramE">various content, language contained in your comments and
other information</span>. </p>

<p><br>
Our site contains links, including banner and other ads, to other Websites. We
are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites.
Our site may also link to Websites that feature our trademarks and names along
with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy
policy on that co-branded Website, as the co-branded Website may not be under
our control. <br>
Applications you use or download from our site may contain third party digital
rights management systems (“DRMS? <span class="GramE">which</span> may
allow for communication between your software and the third party and utilize
security features (e.g., preventing distribution of or access to the
applications in the event of unauthorized use). These DRMS are subject to their
own license agreements and you agree that we shall not be responsible for any
loss or damage of any sort relating to the use of the DRMS or your dealings
with such third parties. The applications may also contain DRMS produced by us
which allow for communication between the applications you use or download and
our systems and which collect information describing your computer system in
order to prevent illegal or unauthorized use of the applications. </p>

<p><br>
For reasons such as improving member experience and providing customized communications
to our users, we may receive information about you from third party sources and
our web logs and add it to the information that we have received from you. Web
logs automatically record anything a web server sees, which may include e-mail
addresses you enter into a form or pages viewed by a user at a particular IP
address. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Information Sharing </strong><br>
We will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties,
aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders or
processing payment, that either are bound to comply with our privacy policy or
have privacy policies that protect your information unless you have
“opted-<span class="SpellE">in?to</span> such sharing. If you have
previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you
are still considered to have opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, and
whether or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to accept and
process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and such third
parties may get access to your personal information for the purposes of
providing services or products to you on our behalf. In addition, if you
opt-out, we may share that information with third parties who send e-mails on
our behalf so that they do not e-mail you. </p>

<p><br>
However, we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or
if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with
the law or with legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights
or property; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. </p>

<p><br>
We may request demographic information from you (for example, your age,
education level or household income) from time to time. We will not share that
information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other
entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your
permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will
give them aggregate information only. </p>

<p><br>
In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal information may
be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Children Under 13 </strong><br>
Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume products
purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. We respect the
privacy of parents and children and are committed to complying with the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites
that ask for age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who
identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited
circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted under COPPA. </p>

<p><br>
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information
to <span class="GramE">we</span>, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal
mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning
that it relates to a child under the age of 13. Please note that it is possible
some of this information may remain archived in web logs and back-up archives
after we delete the information from its active database (see above regarding
web <span class="GramE">logs,</span> and below regarding archived information). </p>

<p><br>
We believe that parents should supervise their children's online activities and
consider using parental control tools available from online services and
software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment.
These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their
name, address and other personal information without parental permission. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Other </strong><br>
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration
of the information under our control. These include a firewall to prevent
unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information
in a separate database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing
secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over
the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure. We
will protect the transmission of credit card information through industry
standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. </p>

<p><br>
We may offer chat, user reviews, multi-player games, bulletin board, or other
public functions and any posting by you is considered public information
available to other users. Any posting is governed by our Terms of Use. You
should take care to not use personal information in your screen name or other
information that might be publicly available to other users. </p>

<p><br>
If a user elects to use our site for informing a friend about our site or
particular features or content, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail
address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them
to visit our site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending
this one-time e-mail. </p>

<p><br>
Your personal information is password-protected, and you should take
appropriate measures to protect the secrecy of your password. If you use a
computer in a public place or share a computer with others, remember to sign
out and close your browser window when you finish a session with us in order to
prevent others from accessing your personal information. </p>

<p><br>
We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and
information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may
remain archived after we delete the information from its active database (see
above regarding web logs). We maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal
and other non-marketing purposes. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Profile</strong> <br>
You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of your profile by notifying
us when you change your address, title, phone number, or e-mail address. If at
any time you wish to update your information or stop receiving communication
from us, sign in and then select ‘update your profile' to change your
newsletter preferences. </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Binding Agreement </strong><br>
Your use of our site, including any dispute concerning privacy, is subject to
this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. By using our Site, you are accepting
the practices set out in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. We reserve
