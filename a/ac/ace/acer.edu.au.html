                                                <br>
    Every time we collect or otherwise deal with your personal information, we will
    be regulated by the National Privacy Principles contained within the Privacy
    Act 1988 (Cth). ACER has developed this Privacy Statement to inform you about
    how ACER will collect, hold, use, and disclose personal information of our customers
    or other individuals, how individuals can gain access to personal information
    held by us and how an individual may inquire about how we deal with personal
    information. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="subtitle2">Collection of your personal information </span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="standard">We only collect your personal information where that
        personal information is necessary for one or more of our functions or activities.
        Depending on your relationship with us, this information may include, but
        is not limited to the following information: <br>
    Name <br>
    Address <br>
    e-mail address <br>
    Telephone number <br>
    Registration information for ACER testing programs <br>
    Test answers <br>
    Survey information <br>
    Information about your use of ACER Products or Services <br>
    <br>
    When collecting this personal information, we will do so only by lawful and fair
    means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. <br>
        <br>
    When collecting personal information about you which, for the purposes of the
    Privacy Act is regarded as sensitive information or health information, we will
    collect that information from you or from third parties only with your consent.<br>
        </span><span class="standard"><br>
    At or before the time we collect personal information about you (or if that is
    not practicable, as soon as practicable thereafter), we will provide you with
    a statement outlining certain basic facts concerning us and our information handling
    practices as required by the Privacy Act. <br>
            <br>
    Where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will only collect personal
    information about you directly and not from third parties. However, in some instances,
    this will not be practicable. If we collect personal information about you from
    a third party then we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you receive the
    information that we are obliged to make you aware of. This may involve us contacting
    you directly, or a third party discharging our obligations on our behalf. </span><br>
            <br>
            <span class="subtitle2">Use and disclosure of your personal information </span><br>
            <span class="standard">ACER collects, uses and discloses your personal
            information for a range of purposes. These purposes depend largely upon
            your relationship with us. <br>
            <br>
    We will use personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected.
    The primary purpose of collection is the main reason we collect your personal
    information in the first instance. For example, if you are a customer of ACER,
    the primary purpose may be to facilitate your purchase of an ACER Product or
    Service, or if you are a job applicant it may be to conduct the recruitment exercise
    to select ACER staff. <br>
        <br>
    Generally speaking, ACER uses and discloses personal information for purposes
    such as: <br>
â€¢ to provide ACER Products and Services <br>
â€¢ to conduct educational research <br>
â€¢ to provide educational assessment and testing programs <br>
    <br>
    ACER sometimes contracts out various services associated with our functions and
    activities. This may involve the disclosure of your personal information to other
    persons and organisations, both within Australia and overseas. In general these
    include disclosure (where necessary) within ACER and to service providers that
    assist us to provide ACER products or services such as insurance companies, credit
    providers and those that assist us in tailoring our products and services to
    our client needs. <br>
        <br>
    Where ACER does disclose your personal information to other parties it has in
    place <br>
    arrangements or understandings with those third parties to ensure that your personal
    information is handled in a manner consistent with our obligations under this
    privacy policy. Where appropriate, we will ensure that your personal information
    is de-identified before being used or destroyed or de-identified if it is no
    longer necessary that it be retained. <br>
        <br>
    The types of persons and organisations to which may disclose your personal information
    include the following: <br>
â€¢ organisations with whom we have arrangements or agreements for the purpose
of promoting <br>
    our products or services and any agents used by us in administering such arrangements
    or <br>
    agreements; <br>
â€¢ our agents, contractors and external advisers who carry on our functions and
activities or who <br>
    assist us to carry on our functions and activities from time to time; <br>
â€¢ payment systems operators; <br>
â€¢ other parties to whom we are authorised or required by law to disclose information. <br>
â€¢ schools, educational systems, psychologists, human resource practitioners
and others who have contracted with ACER for the provision of its products and services.
For example, if you are a candidate for an ACER scholarship test ACER will supply
your test results to those schools to which you have applied for a scholarship. </span><br>
        <span class="subtitle2"><br>
    Consent and sensitive information </span><br>
    <span class="standard">We will only collect sensitive or health information from
    you or about you with your consent. By supplying sensitive or health information
    about yourself in writing you will be taken to have given your consent to our
    collection of that information. <br>
        <br>
    In most instances, when we collect sensitive information directly from you, we
    will obtain your consent to use it for our various purposes. When we obtain such
    information from a third party we will usually enlist that third party to obtain
    consent on our behalf. Where this occurs, we shall comply with the Privacy Act
    at all times. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="subtitle2">Security and quality of your personal information </span><br>
        <span class="standard">ACER will take reasonable steps to ensure that any
        of your personal information that we collect, store, use or disclose is accurate,
        complete and up to date. <br>
        <br>
    We will also take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from
    misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance
    with the requirements of our privacy policy and the Privacy Act. </span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="title"><span class="subtitle2"><br>
    Requests for access to and correction of your personal information </span><br>
    <span class="standard">You have a right of access to your personal information. <br>
    <br>
    You may request details of the personal information we hold about you, by writing
    to or <br>
    contacting us at any time. <br>
    <br>
    No fee will be charged for making the request. We may charge a fee for the provision
    of this information to cover administrative costs. However, we will inform you
    of any fee at the time a request is made. <br>
        <br>
    In general, we will allow access to the personal information we hold about you.
    However, we may deny access to personal information to you to the extent that: <br>
        <br>
â€¢ providing access would pose a serious threat (or in the case of personal information
other than health information, a serious and imminent threat) to the life or health
of any individual; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other
individuals; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ your request for access is frivolous or vexatious; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ it is otherwise appropriate for us to deny access in accordance with the Privacy
Act. <br>
        <br>
    We will not deny you access to any personal information following an access request
    without providing you with a reason for the denial. <br>
        <br>
    Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within ACER
    in <br>
    connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, we may give
    you an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct
    access to the information. <br>
        <br>
    If you are aware that any of your personal information is inaccurate, incomplete
    or out of date following an access request, or because your circumstances have
    changed, please inform us so that we can update our records. We will correct
    any incorrect personal information and will not refuse to make a correction without
    providing you with a reason for the refusal. However, if we do refuse to make
    a correction, we will take reasonable steps to place with the disputed information
    a statement from you claiming that the disputed information in your opinion is
    not accurate, complete or up-to-date. </span><br>
        <span class="subtitle2"><br>
