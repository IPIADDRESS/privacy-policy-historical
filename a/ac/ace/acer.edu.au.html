    ACER Privacy Policy <br>
    <br>
    <span class="standard">Protecting your privacy is important to ACER. <br>
    <br>
    Every time we collect or otherwise deal with your personal information, we will
    be regulated by 
    the National Privacy Principles contained within the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
    ACER has 
    developed this Privacy Statement to inform you about how ACER will collect, hold,
    use, and 
    disclose personal information of our customers or other individuals, how individuals
    can gain 
    access to personal information held by us and how an individual may inquire about
    how we deal 
    with personal information. </span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="subtitle2">Collection of your personal information </span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="standard">We only collect your personal information where that personal
    information is necessary for one
    or more of our functions or activities. Depending on your relationship with us,
    this information 
    may include, but is not limited to the following information: <br>
    Name <br>
    Address <br>
    e-mail address <br>
    Telephone number <br>
    Registration information for ACER testing programs <br>
    Test answers <br>
    Survey information <br>
    Information about your use of ACER Products or Services <br>
    <br>
    When collecting this personal information, we will do so only by lawful and fair
    means and not 
    in an unreasonably intrusive way. <br>
    <br>
    When collecting personal information about you which, for the purposes of the
    Privacy Act is 
    regarded as sensitive information or health information, we will collect that
    information from 
    you or from third parties only with your consent.<br>
    </span><span class="standard"><br>
            At or before the time we collect personal information about you (or if
                    that is not practicable, as 
        soon as practicable thereafter), we will provide you with a statement outlining
        certain basic facts 
        concerning us and our information handling practices as required by the Privacy
        Act. <br>
        <br>
        Where it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will only collect personal
        information about 
        you directly and not from third parties. However, in some instances, this
        will not be practicable. 
        If we collect personal information about you from a third party then we will
        take reasonable 
        steps to ensure that you receive the information that we are obliged to make
        you aware of. This 
        may involve us contacting you directly, or a third party discharging our
        obligations on our 
        behalf. </span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="subtitle2">Use and disclosure of your personal information </span><br>
        <span class="standard">ACER collects, uses and discloses your personal information
        for a range of purposes. These
        purposes depend largely upon your relationship with us. <br>
        <br>
        We will use personal information for the primary purpose for which it was
        collected. The
        primary purpose of collection is the main reason we collect your personal
        information in the first 
        instance. For example, if you are a customer of ACER, the primary purpose
        may be to facilitate
    your purchase of an ACER Product or Service, or if you are a job applicant it
        may be to conduct 
    the recruitment exercise to select ACER staff. <br>
    <br>
    Generally speaking, ACER uses and discloses personal information for purposes such
    as: <br>
â€¢ to provide ACER Products and Services <br>
â€¢ to conduct educational research <br>
â€¢ to provide educational assessment and testing programs <br>
<br>
    ACER sometimes contracts out various services associated with our functions and
    activities. This may involve the disclosure of your personal information to other
    persons and organisations, 
    both within Australia and overseas. In general these include disclosure (where
    necessary) within 
    ACER and to service providers that assist us to provide ACER products or services
    such as 
    insurance companies, credit providers and those that assist us in tailoring our
    products and 
    services to our client needs. <br>
    <br>
    Where ACER does disclose your personal information to other parties it has in place <br>
    arrangements or understandings with those third parties to ensure that your personal
    information 
    is handled in a manner consistent with our obligations under this privacy policy.
    Where 
    appropriate, we will ensure that your personal information is de-identified before
    being used or 
    destroyed or de-identified if it is no longer necessary that it be retained. <br>
    <br>
    The types of persons and organisations to which may disclose your personal information
    include 
    the following: <br>
â€¢ organisations with whom we have arrangements or agreements for the purpose
    of promoting 
    our products or services and any agents used by us in administering such arrangements
    or 
    agreements; <br>
â€¢ our agents, contractors and external advisers who carry on our functions and
    activities or who <br>
    assist us to carry on our functions and activities from time to time; <br>
â€¢ payment systems operators; <br>
â€¢ other parties to whom we are authorised or required by law to disclose information. <br>
â€¢ schools, educational systems, psychologists, human resource practitioners
    and others who 
    have contracted with ACER for the provision of its products and services. For
example, if 
    you are a candidate for an ACER scholarship test ACER will supply your test results
    to those 
    schools to which you have applied for a scholarship. </span><br>
    <span class="subtitle2"><br>
    Consent and sensitive information </span><br>
    <span class="standard">We will only collect sensitive or health information from
    you or about you with your consent.
    By supplying sensitive or health information about yourself in writing you will
    be taken to have 
    given your consent to our collection of that information. <br>
    <br>
    In most instances, when we collect sensitive information directly from you, we
    will obtain your
    consent to use it for our various purposes. When we obtain such information from
    a third party 
    we will usually enlist that third party to obtain consent on our behalf. Where
    this occurs, we 
    shall comply with the Privacy Act at all times. </span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="subtitle2">Security and quality of your personal information </span><br>
    <span class="standard">ACER will take reasonable steps to ensure that any of
    your personal information that we collect, 
    store, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date. <br>
    <br>

    We will also take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from
    misuse and loss and 
    from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure in accordance with the requirements
    of our 
    privacy policy and the Privacy Act. </span></p>
<p align="left" class="title"><span class="subtitle2"><br>
    Requests for access to and correction of your personal information </span><br>
    <span class="standard">You have a right of access to your personal information. <br>
    <br>
    You may request details of the personal information we hold about you, by writing
    to or <br>
    contacting us at any time. <br>
    <br>
    No fee will be charged for making the request. We may charge a fee for the provision
    of this 
    information to cover administrative costs. However, we will inform you of any
    fee at the time a 
    request is made. <br>
    <br>
    In general, we will allow access to the personal information we hold about you.
    However, we
    may deny access to personal information to you to the extent that: <br>
    <br>
â€¢ providing access would pose a serious threat (or in the case of personal information
    other 
    than health information, a serious and imminent threat) to the life or health
of any individual; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other
    individuals; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ your request for access is frivolous or vexatious; <br>
    or <br>
â€¢ it is otherwise appropriate for us to deny access in accordance with the Privacy
    Act. <br>
    <br>
    We will not deny you access to any personal information following an access request
    without 
    providing you with a reason for the denial. <br>
    <br>
    Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within ACER
    in <br>
    connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process, we may give
    you an
    explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than direct access
    to the information. <br>
    <br>
    If you are aware that any of your personal information is inaccurate, incomplete
    or out of date 
    following an access request, or because your circumstances have changed, please
    inform us so 
    that we can update our records. We will correct any incorrect personal information
    and will not 
    refuse to make a correction without providing you with a reason for the refusal.
    However, if we 
    do refuse to make a correction, we will take reasonable steps to place with the
    disputed 
    information a statement from you claiming that the disputed information in your
    opinion is not 
    accurate, complete or up-to-date. </span><br>
    <span class="subtitle2"><br>
    CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT </span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="standard">We may change our policies and update the Privacy Policy
    Statement from time to time. We may
    send you an updated Privacy Policy Statement using methods we choose from time
    to time, and 
    may publish it on our website at www.acer.edu.au <br>
    <br>

    If you have any concerns or inquiries about how we deal with your personal information,
    you
