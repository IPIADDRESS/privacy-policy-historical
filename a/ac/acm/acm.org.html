<font size="3" face="arial">              
<font color="#000000">Dear ACM Member:</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">As a major organization in the information technology field, it is essential that ACM take a leadership position in crafting a Privacy Policy. In fact, one of the imperatives of <a href="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html#sect1">ACM's Code of Ethics</a> (1.7), deals with respecting the privacy of others.</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">Since the purpose of this policy should be to protect the rights and the confidentiality of its members (see <a href="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html#sect1">ACM Code of Ethics</a>, 1.8), it follows that drafting such a policy should be a participatory project, a collaborative effort that attempts to define not only the reasons for</font> <font color="#000000">establishing specific policies but helps define some of the much talked about and cited cyber intrusions, such as "unsolicited email"&nbsp; and the very nature of contact itself.</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">At the same time members will be commenting on this Draft of ACM's overall Privacy Policy, the ACM Committee On Privacy Policy, will be revising this draft based on member comment. These revisions will be posted on the Web at <a href="http://www.acm.org/serving/">http://www.acm.org/serving/</a> periodically for you to understand how member comment has re-shaped the original draft.</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">In soliciting member comments on the attached document we're hoping that members who are deeply interested in privacy issues come forward and identify themselves so that new grass-roots efforts can be created.</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">Once a final draft of the Privacy Policy is established, ACM will undertake a thorough review of its practices and make the necessary changes to comply with the new policy.</font>

</font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">Please send your comments on the draft ACM Privacy Policy to: <a href="mailto:privacy@acm.org">privacy@acm.org</a>. Please also see the <a href="http://www.acm.org/serving/acm-privacy1.html">archive</a> of comments received.</font>

<font color="#FF0000">DRAFT</font> ACM Privacy Policy

<font color="#FF0000">24 September 1998</font>

</font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#FF0000">[This draft Privacy Policy is posted for
feedback purposes only. It does not represent current ACM
policy. Comments appear in square brackets. Send comments to <a href="mailto:privacy@acm.org">privacy@acm.org</a>]</font>

</font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial">The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is committed to
protecting the privacy of its members and customers. This policy
applies to the Association as well as to its special interest groups,
chapters, and other sub-units.

</font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial"><font color="#000000">ACM maintains member databases that contain
mailing, billing, and member profile information, as well as a record
of each member's product and service purchases. ACM also maintains
databases of non-member purchases and of registrations for conferences
and other ACM activities.  The information in these databases is used
by authorized ACM staff members to process orders; mail invoices,
purchases, renewal notices, and announcements; respond to member
inquiries; and help us improve our offerings. Member records are
maintained as long as an individual is an ACM member and for two years
following a membership lapse. Purchase and registration databases may
be retained for up to two years. All personally identifiable
information contained in ACM membership, purchase, and registration
databases is treated with strict confidentiality and will be used only
for the purposes stated in this policy, except where required by
law. These records will not be "enhanced" or overlaid with data from
other sources. In addition, specific practices with respect to <a href="#email">email addresses</a>, <a href="#postal_mail">postal
addresses</a>, information provided for the <a href="#mem_dir">ACM
Membership Directory</a>, and information collected through the <a href="#web_site">ACM Web site</a> and <a href="#web_accts">ACM Web
accounts</a> are described below. </font><font color="#FF0000">[Note,
ACM currently does not have a record retention policy. However, as
records more than two years old are rarely if ever used, we recommend
that ACM adopt the more privacy-friendly practice of purging database
entries after two years, retaining only aggregate or anonymized
information. We need to determine whether there are any legal problems
with doing that. We also need to add a statement about how ACM will
respond to subpeonas]</font>

</font></font></p><p><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial"><b><font color="#000000">ACM members may access the information
contained in their membership records and correct and update their
member profile and mailing information online at <a href="http://www.acm.org/membership/dir/profile.html">http://www.acm.org/membership/dir/profile.html</a>
or by contacting </font>ACM's Member Services Department by phone:
+1-212-626-0500, 1-800-342-6626, fax: +1-212-944-1318, or email:

</font></font></p><h3><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial"><a name="email"></a>Email</font></font></h3><font size="3" face="arial"><font size="3" face="arial">

ACM does not sell or rent email addresses. ACM uses email addresses
to send the following:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>"Must Have" messages that help to service ACM members including
answers to member questions; acknowledgments of the receipt of
membership applications and other orders; and membership renewal
notices.

</li><li>Occasional "Member Update" announcements about ACM services that
we believe to be of some importance to members. These announcements
are short straightforward messages that contain pointers to online
resources where members can explore the information more fully.</li>

<li>Email messaging that is part of a program for which the member has
registered (e.g. an ACM Digital Library early alert email system).

</li><li>Mailing lists disseminating information to targeted ACM groups
(e.g. special interest group listservs, chapter listservs).
</li></ol>
<p>
All ACM email lists -- including the Member Update list -- and ACM
programs that send automatic email messages have easy to follow
"unsubscribe" instructions.

</p><h3><a name="postal_mail"></a>Postal Mail</h3>

ACM provides five mailing list options to its members:

<p>
</p><ol>

<li>Receive ACM invoices and products ordered only.

</li><li>Receive ACM invoices and products ordered, and announcements from
ACM and its sub-units; do not receive ACM Member Value Plus
announcements.

</li><li>Receive ACM invoices, products, and announcements from ACM and its
sub-units including ACM Member Value Plus announcements. (This is the
default option.)

</li><li>In addition to ACM mailings, receive announcements from sister
societies.

</li><li>In addition to ACM mailings, receive mailings from companies and
other organizations including announcements and advertisements for
books, magazines, journals, computer software and hardware, courses,
and financial programs.
</li></ol>
<p>
Members may select one of the above options by contacting ACM's
Member Services Department or updating their member profile
online. <font color="#FF0000">[These options will also be printed on
future membership forms.]</font> 

</p><p>
The names and mailing addresses of members who have selected options 4
or 5 may be rented to outside organizations to send mailing packages
that have been carefully screened by authorized ACM staff for their
suitability.  ACM member names and mailing addresses are never
sold. <font color="#FF0000">[Currently all members have option 4 by
default, unless they opt out. ACM mailing list sales bring in about
$290,000 per year, or about $3.50 per member each year. Therefore,
switching to the opt-in policy as recommended here, might require a
small dues increase to make up for the lost mailing list revenue. We
recommend that members continue to receive ACM announcements including
MVP announcements by default because we assume that if you join ACM,
you have an interest in receiving information about the association's
services and membership benefits. Also, to avoid confusion we
recommend that future MVP mailings be clearly identified with the ACM
MVP logo.]</font>

</p><p>The names and mailing addresses contained in ACM product and
registration databases may be used for mailing invoices, products
ordered, and ACM announcements only.  Individuals can ask not to
receive ACM announcements at the time they register or place an
order. <font color="#FF0000">[Again, we recommend that people who
order ACM products or register for ACM events receive ACM
announcements by default.]</font>

</p><h3><a name="mem_dir"></a>Membership Directory</h3>

The ACM Membership Directory was created to identify the members of
ACM to one another, and promote the sharing of ideas and dissemination
of information among members. This Directory is accessible only to ACM
members and ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) members. Members can
search only the Directory records for the groups to which
they belong.

<p>By default, each member's name, city, state or province, and
country are included in the Directory. No other information about an
ACM member (including street address) will be included in the
Directory unless the member decides to add information. The
information that can be included in a member's Directory listing is
taken from the member's profile data, and members can include as much
or as little information as they wish.&nbsp; Members can remove their
information from the Membership Directory or add information by
updating their <a href="http://www.acm.org/membership/dir/profile.html">online
profiles</a>. ACM encourages members to include their email addresses
and other information in the Directory as a way of facilitating
quality networking and information sharing.

</p><p>The Directory may not be used for commercial purposes or to
generate lists for bulk mailings. In order to prevent the harvesting
of Directory information, searches will return a limited number of
names that match the search criteria. To see any additional
information that a member has chosen to include in the Directory, the
searcher must select a particular member name.

</p><h3><a name="web_site"></a>ACM Web Site</h3>

This policy applies to the "acm.org" Web site maintained by ACM. ACM
sub-units and individual ACM members are encouraged to adopt similar
policies for their Web sites.

<p>Other than in the restricted-access portions of our site that
require an ACM Web Account, ACM does not log the identity of
visitors. However, we may keep access logs, for example containing a
visitor's IP address and search queries. We may analyze log files
periodically to help maintain and improve our Web site, and enforce
our online service polices. Cookies are used to maintain user
information only in the restricted-access portions of our site. Raw
(not aggregated or anonymized) log files are treated with strict
confidentiality and retained for no longer than two years.

</p><p>On some pages of our site we allow individuals to submit
information for the purposes of joining ACM; renewing or updating
their membership; ordering products and services; or registering for
participation in a conference, contest, or other activity. Information
collected on these pages will be placed in the appropriate ACM
database and used according to the ACM Privacy Policy.

</p><h3><a name="web_accts"></a>ACM Web Accounts</h3>

Some portions of the ACM Web site, including the ACM Digital Library,
require an ACM Web account. To create an account, ACM members must
provide their name, ACM member number, and email address. They are
assigned a "username" (which they may change) and asked to create a
password and provide the day and month of their birth (for account
verification purposes).

<p>Non-members must setup an ACM Web account in order to use the
"Search" facility in the ACM Digital Library. Non-members are asked
for their name, email address, and postal address when they create
their account. By default, ACM may send information about ACM products
and services to non-member ACM Web account holders via
email. Non-members may request that they not&nbsp;receive such
information when they create their account.

</p><p>Information collected about ACM Web account usage -- including logs
of Web pages visited, searches performed, and Digital Library content
downloaded -- will be stored in an anonymized form and used to improve
the ACM Digital Library and other ACM Web offerings. <font color="#FF0000">[This information is currently not anonymized, but as
long as some demographic information is tied to each anonymized user
name, it does not appear that it is necessary to identify users by
name in these logs, except perhaps to track down abuse -- for example
copyright violations or abuse of Member Directory information.  This
issue should be discussed further.]</font> Other information provided
in the process of creating or using a Web account will be placed in
the appropriate ACM database and used according to the ACM Privacy
Policy.
