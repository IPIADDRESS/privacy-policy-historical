            <P><FONT color=#000000>As a major organization in the information 
            technology field, it is essential that ACM take a leadership 
            position in crafting a Privacy Policy. In fact, one of the 
            imperatives of <A 
            href="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html#sect1">ACM's Code of 
            Ethics</A> (1.7), deals with respecting the privacy of 
            others.</FONT> 
            <P><FONT color=#000000>Since the purpose of this policy should be to 
            protect the rights and the confidentiality of its members (see <A 
            href="http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html#sect1">ACM Code of 
            Ethics</A>, 1.8), it follows that drafting such a policy should be a 
            participatory project, a collaborative effort that attempts to 
            define not only the reasons for</FONT> <FONT 
            color=#000000>establishing specific policies but helps define some 
            of the much talked about and cited cyber intrusions, such as 
            "unsolicited email"  and the very nature of contact 
            itself.</FONT> 
            <P><FONT color=#000000>At the same time members will be commenting 
            on this Draft of ACM's overall Privacy Policy, the ACM Committee On 
            Privacy Policy, will be revising this draft based on member comment. 
            These revisions will be posted on the Web at <A 
            href="http://www.acm.org/serving/">http://www.acm.org/serving/</A>

            <P><FONT color=#000000>In soliciting member comments on the attached 
            document we're hoping that members who are deeply interested in 
            privacy issues come forward and identify themselves so that new 
            grass-roots efforts can be created.</FONT> 
            <P><FONT color=#000000>Once a final draft of the Privacy Policy is 
            established, ACM will undertake a thorough review of its practices

            <P>ACM Privacy Policy 
            <H1></H1><FONT color=#ff0000>As of 11/8/00</FONT> -->
            <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is committed to 
            protecting the privacy of its members and customers. ACM recognizes 
            the interest of its members and customers in the confidentiality of 
            their personal information. ACM only maintains personal information 
            that is relevant to ACM activities and seeks to maintain accurate, 
            complete, and timely information. 
            </p><p>The security of personal information is important to ACM. ACM 
            maintains all personal data with technical, administrative, and 
            physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, 
            destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. No 
            computer system or information can ever be fully protected against 
            every possible hazard. ACM provides reasonable and appropriate 
            security controls to protect personal information against 
            foreseeable hazards. 
            </p><p>ACM maintains member databases that contain mailing, billing, and 
            member profile information, as well as a record of each member's 
            product and service purchases. ACM also maintains databases of 
            member and non-member purchases and of registrations for conferences 
            and other ACM activities. The information in these databases is used 
            by authorized ACM staff members to process orders; mail invoices, 
            purchases, renewal notices, and announcements; respond to member 
            inquiries; and help us improve our offerings. Member records are 
            maintained as long as an individual is an ACM member and for two 
            years following a membership lapse. Purchases and credit card 
            transactions are retained for as long as appropriate to meet 
            contractual, tax, or auditing needs. 
            </p><p>All personally identifiable information contained in ACM 
            membership, purchase, and registration databases is treated as 
            confidential and will be used only for the purposes stated in this 
            policy, except where required by law. 
            </p><p>Just like any other record keeper, ACM may be required to 
            disclose personal information in response to valid legal process. 
            This includes a search warrant, subpoena, or court order. 
            Disclosures may also be appropriate to protect ACM's legal rights or 
            during emergencies if physical safety is believed to be at risk. 
            These disclosures are possible although unlikely. 
            </p><p>Personal data about ACM members and customers may, from time to 
            time, be collected or shared with outside contractors, auditors, 
            consultants, and others hired by ACM to assist in carrying out 
            financial or operational activities. ACM informs recipients about 
            safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use it only 
            for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy, and 
            to return it or destroy it upon completion of the activity. 
            </p><p>ACM members may access the information contained in their 
            membership records and correct and update their member profile and 
            mailing information by going to the following web page. - <a href="http://www.acm.org/membership/dir/profile.html">http://www.acm.org/membership/dir/profile.html</a> 
            In order to update your postal tolerance you will need to contact
                        ACM's Member Services Department by phone: 
            +1-212-626-0500, 1-800-342-6626, fax: +1-212-944-1318, or email: <a href="mailto:acmhelp@acm.org">acmhelp@acm.org</a>. 
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Email Policies</b> 
            </p><p>ACM does not sell, rent, or exchange email addresses of its 
            members and customers. ACM uses email addresses to send the 
            following: 
            </p><ol>
              <li>"Must Have" messages that help to service ACM members 
              including answers to member questions; acknowledgments of the 
              receipt of membership applications, renewal notices, and other 
              orders. 
              </li><li>Occasional "Member Update" announcements about ACM services 
              that we believe to be of some importance to members. These 
              announcements are short, straightforward messages that contain 
              pointers to online resources where members can explore the 
              information more fully. 
              </li><li>Email messaging that is part of a program for which the member 
              has registered (e.g. an ACM Digital Library early alert email 
              system). 
              </li><li>Email distribution lists targeted at ACM groups (e.g. special 
              interest group members, chapter officers, etc.). Only ACM 
              headquarters staff can create and support "acm.org" email 
              distribution lists. </li></ol>
            <p>All ACM created and supported email distribution lists have 
            "unsubscribe" instructions. 
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Postal Mail Policies</b> 
            </p><p>ACM provides four [postal] mailing list options to its members: 
            </p><ol>
              <li>ACM Subscription &amp; Renewal Notices Only: receive only 
              products subscribed to plus renewal invoices. 
              </li><li>ACM Announcements: information about ACM's Member Value Plus 
              Program (a program offering discounts on products and services 
              other than ACM's), Calls for Papers, Advance Conference Programs, 
              Local Chapter Announcements. 
              </li><li>ACM Announcements &amp; Sister Society Announcements: receive 
              all of the above plus mailings from other computing societies 
              (e.g. IEEE-CS). 
              </li><li>ACM Announcements, Sister Society Announcements, and selected 
              Information Technology Offers: receive all of the above, plus 
              selected non-ACM information technology offers from publications, 
              conference sponsors, software/hardware vendors. (This is the 
              default option for members). </li></ol>
            <p>The names and mailing addresses of members who have selected 
            options #2, #3, or #4 (above) may be rented to outside organizations 
            for the purposes of sending mailing packages that have been 
            carefully screened by authorized ACM staff for their suitability. 
            Managers in ACM's Membership Department are responsible for the 
            screening of materials used by those companies or organizations 
            renting ACM's mailing list. Materials must be of an educational 
            nature for ACM to rent its list. ACM licenses mailing list usage for 
            one-time only -- the standard mailing list rental practice, and 
            renters are asked to sign their agreement to this practice. ACM's 
            Mailing List Manager does not "enhance" or overlay any data on ACM's 
            mailing list. ACM does not rent telephone or email addresses. 
            </p><p>In order to update your postal tolerance you will need to contact
                        ACM's Member Services Department by phone: 
            +1-212-626-0500, 1-800-342-6626, fax: +1-212-944-1318, or email: <a href="mailto:acmhelp@acm.org">acmhelp@acm.org</a>. 
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Online Membership 
            Directory</b> 
            </p><p>The ACM Membership Directory was created to identify the members 
            of ACM to one another, and to promote the sharing of ideas among 
            members. This Directory is accessible only to ACM members and ACM 
            Special Interest Group (SIG) members. Members can search the 
            Directory for ACM members by name, and members of Special Interest 
            Groups can search the directory for names of individuals belonging 
            to that particular group. 
            </p><p>By default, each member's name, city, state or province, and 
            country are included in the Directory. No other information about an 
            ACM member (including street address) is included in the Directory 
            unless the member decides to add this information, making it 
            "public" or "not public". The information included in a member's 
            Directory listing is taken from the member's profile data, and 
            members can "make public" as much or as little information as they 
            wish. Members can remove personal information from the Membership 
            Directory or add information by updating their online profiles. 
            </p><p>The Directory should not be used for the unsolicited promotion of 
            products and/or services. In order to prevent the harvesting of 
            Directory information, searches will return a limited number of 
            names that match the search criteria. To see any additional 
            information that a member has chosen to include in the Directory, 
            the searcher must select a particular member name. 
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ACM Web Site</b> 
            </p><p>This policy applies to the "acm.org" Web site maintained by ACM. 
            </p><p>Other than in the restricted-access portions of ACM's site that 
            requires an ACM Web Account, ACM does not log the identity of 
            visitors. However, we may keep access logs, for example containing a 
            visitor's IP address and search queries. We may analyze log files 
            periodically to help maintain and improve our Web site and enforce 
            our online service polices. Cookies are only set when users visit 
            restricted portions of our website. Raw log files are treated as 
            confidential and retained for no longer than two years. 
            </p><p>On some pages of our site we allow individuals to submit 
            information for the purposes of joining ACM; renewing or updating 
            their membership; ordering products and services; or registering for 
            a conference, contest, or other activity. Information collected on 
            these pages will be used according to ACM's Privacy Policy. 
            </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>ACM Web Account Policy</b> 

            </p><p>Some portions of the ACM Web site, specifically the ACM Digital 
            Library, require an ACM Web Account for both members and visitors. 
            To create an account, ACM members and customers must provide their 
            name, ACM member number (if applicable), and email address. They are 
            assigned a "username" (which they may change) and asked to create a 
            password and provide the day and month of their birth (for account 
            verification purposes). 
            </p><p>Customers must setup an ACM Web account in order to use the 
            "Search" facility in the ACM Digital Library. Non-members are asked 
            for their name, email address, and postal address when they create 
            their account. By default, ACM may send information about ACM 
            products and services to non-member ACM Web account holders via 
            email. Customers may request that they not receive such information 
            via email. 
            </p><p>Information collected about ACM Web account usage -- including 
            logs of Web pages visited, searches performed, and Digital Library 
            content downloaded -- will be stored in an anonymized form and used 
            to improve the ACM Digital Library and other ACM Web offerings. 
            Other information provided in the process of creating or using a Web 
            account is used according to the ACM Privacy Policy.
