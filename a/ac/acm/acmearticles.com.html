<span class="articletitle">ACME Articles Privacy Policy</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  AcmeArticles.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
  technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may
  use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,
  telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never
  sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.<br>
  <br><p>
  <span class="articletitle">How we gather information from users</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the
  activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For
  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access
  to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters
  or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate
  in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
  areas of our site. Like most Web sites, AcmeArticles.com also collects information
  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent
  to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
  or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit.
  Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing
  you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control
  the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information
  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,
  but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may
  be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
  customize the site's features according to your preferences.<br></span></p><p>
  <br>
  <span class="articletitle"> What we do with the information we collect</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy
  and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
  <br>
  Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may
  be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage
  patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance
  our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
  are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with
  our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include
  any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify
  you individually.<br>
  <br>
  We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.AcmeArticles.com
  to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences;
  our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by www.AcmeArticles.com
  and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
  <br>
  Personally Identifiable Information collected by AcmeArticles.com may also be
  used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
  processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests,
  and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical
  support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example)
  may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted
  by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,
  we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
  transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also
  disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when
  we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the
  collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities
  whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide
  you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br></span></p><p>
  <br>
  <span class="articletitle">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  AcmeArticles.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
  the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
  partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through
  our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
  For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part
  of a frame on a www.AcmeArticles.com page, certain content that is actually
  created or hosted by a third party. Also, through AcmeArticles.com you may be
  introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests
  or sweepstakes offered by other parties. AcmeArticles.com is not responsible
  for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable
  privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature
  or page operated by a third party.<br>
  <br>
  While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
  may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences
  or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served
  by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
  on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies
  or other technology to gather information. AcmeArticles.com does not control
  the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and
  is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
  <br>
  You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
  Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
  publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge
  and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
  Such activities are beyond the control of AcmeArticles.com and this policy. <br></span></p><p>
  <br>
  <span class="articletitle">Children</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  AcmeArticles.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable
  Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we
  discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation
  of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe
  AcmeArticles.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact
  us at the address listed below.<br>
</span></p><p> <br>

  <span class="articletitle">Changes to this Policy</span><br>
  <br>
<span class="articletext"><br>
  AcmeArticles.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please
  check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following
  the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information
  collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the
  rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.<br></span></p><p>
  <br>
  <span class="articletitle">Governing law</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="articletext"><br>
  This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Michigan law. If a dispute
  arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of
  a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Antrim. Any costs
  and fees including attorney fees incurred by Acme Articles associated with the mediation
or additional suit will be paid for by you. ie...the party bringing the suit or mediation issues.<br>
  <br>
  If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through
  mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following
  location: Antrim, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment
  upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with
  jurisdiction to do so.<br>
  <br>
  This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not
  create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party. </span></p>
