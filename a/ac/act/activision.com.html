<p><strong>What information does Activision collect?</strong></p>

<p>Activision only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis.  
When you submit personal information to Activision, it will usually take the 
form of: (1) customer service; (2) shopping at our online store; (3) demo 
downloads; and/or, (4) online submission of your resume for job openings.  
The information we collect may include personal information such as your name, 
email address, phone number, and home address.  In addition, we may collect 
demographic information such as your age, gender and interests. </p>

<ul><li>
<u>Customer Service</u></li>

<p>In order to provide you with the best possible customer service, Activision 
may collect some personal information from you including your name, e-mail 
address and birth date. This information will be used only for the purpose of 
solving your customer support inquiry and will be saved for twelve (12) months 
in the event additional customer support requests arise.</p>
 
<li><u>Online Store</u></li>
<p>Activisionâ€™s on-line store is managed by Digital River. In order to purchase 
goods and/or services from our on-line store, you will need to provide Digital 
River with a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, 
mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. Digital River has agreed to 
use any personal information collected in this manner only for the purpose of 
completing the transaction and shall take adequate and appropriate measures to 
assure the confidentiality, security, and integrity of this personal 
information in a manner consistent with this Online Privacy Statement and 
Activisionâ€™s privacy practices and data security policies. </p>

<li><u>Demo Downloads</u></li>
<p>Visitors interested in downloading demonstration versions of Activision games 
with an ESRB rating of "M" (Mature) will need to provide a valid credit card 
number and expiration date. Such information will be used only for the purpose 
of verifying age, and will be deleted from our database immediately after such 
verification.</p>

<li><u>Resumes</u></li>
<p>Activision allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information 
collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and 
evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be 
shared within the company.</p></ul>

<p>Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent 
deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate 
business objectives.</p>


<a name="b"></a>
<p><strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?</strong></p>

<p>If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will 
not be able to (1) purchase at our online store and/or (2) download demos of 
games with "M" ratings.  In addition, your refusal to submit personal 
information may limit our ability to respond to your customer support inquiry 
in a timely fashion.  However, you do not need to provide personal information 
to Activision in order to use our Web site. </p>

<a name="c"></a>
<p><strong>Does Activision use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to 
collect information?</strong></p>

<p>Activision uses cookies on its Web site. A "cookie" is a small bit of 
record-keeping information that Web sites often store on a userâ€™s computer. 
Cookies do not include peopleâ€™s names, e-mail addresses, or other information 
that is personally identifiable; they are used only to quickly identify your 
computer and to "remember" things about your visit, which will allow us to 
speed up your activities and save time you might otherwise normally have to 
spend during your visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert 
you when cookies are being sent to your computer.</p>

<p>We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  An IP address is a 
number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer 
every time you log on to the Internet.</p>

<a name="d"></a>
<p><strong>Who is collecting my personal information and how will it be used?</strong></p>

<p>The information you submit to our Web site is collected and used by Activision 
as set forth <a href="#1">above</a>.</p>
  
<p>From time to time, however, Activision may employ third-party vendors, such 
as Digital River, to collect personal information on Activisionâ€™s behalf.  These 
third parties provide internal support to Activision.com by operating some of 
the services we provide you including free email services and online product 
fulfillment.  Digital River, for instance, fulfills all purchases made from the 
online store at http://store.activision.com. When requesting these services, you 
may be asked to supply your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, 
credit card number and valid expiration date.  Although these third-party 
vendors, not Activision, collect the personal information you provide when 
requesting such services, Activision still requires that they adhere to 
Activisionâ€™s stated privacy policies. This means that third-party vendors such 
as Digital River will never share your personal information with other third 
parties <i><strong>except for providing Activision with your name, address, email address 
and product(s) ordered</strong></i>.</p>

<a name="e"></a>
<p><strong>With whom does Activision share my personal information?</strong></p>

<p>At this time, Activision does not share your personal information with <i>outside</i> third parties.</p>

<a name="f"></a>
<p><strong>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</strong></p>

<p>If you do not want Activision to reply to your customer support inquiry, you 
may opt-out from receiving a response by contacting us at 
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@activision.com">privacypolicy@activision.com</a>, 
or by regular mail at Activision, 3100 Ocean Park 
Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405, ATTN: Business and Legal Affairs/Privacy 
Policy.  We will be happy to honor your request. </p> 

<a name="g"></a>
<p><strong>How do I access my personal information?</strong></p>

<p>If for any reason you wish to view, correct or delete the personal 
information collected about you, please send an email to 
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@activision.com">privacypolicy@activision.com</a>, or write to us at Activision, 3100 Ocean Park 
Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405, ATTN: Business and Legal Affairs/Privacy 
Policy. We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate.</p>

<a name="h"></a>
<p><strong>Does Activision collect personal information from children under 13?</strong></p>

<p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as 
name, address, or email address from children under 13.</p>

<p>We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained 
from young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give 
out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when 
on-line. No information should be submitted to Activision by children 12 and 
under. Children under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage 
their parents to review this privacy policy and to contact us if they would 
like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.</p>
  
<a name="i"></a>  
<p><strong>What safeguards does Activision use to protect my personal information? </strong></p>

<p>Activision ensures data quality, such as the accuracy of information obtained 
from our website visitors. Activision has also taken steps to assure that all 
information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free 
from any alteration. Access to all personal information is strictly controlled. 
In addition, we take reasonable steps to assure that third parties who collect 
personal information on our behalf provide sufficient protection of personal 
information.</p>

<p><strong>How do I ask a question or file a complaint?</strong></p>

<p>Any questions or complaints about this Online Privacy Statement can be 
resolved by contacting Activision at 
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@activision.com">privacypolicy@activision.com</a>, 
or by addressing written inquires to Activision, 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, 
Santa Monica, CA 90405, ATTN: Business and Legal Affairs/Privacy Policy.</p>
