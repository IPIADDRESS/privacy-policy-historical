<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and 
continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by those 
visiting and interacting with this web site. We hold the privacy of your 
personal information in the highest regard. The following discloses our 
information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.</p>

<p>We recognise the importance of protecting your privacy and our policy is 
designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the 
personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed 
decisions when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against 
new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<p><b>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal 
information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend 
this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</b></p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<p>When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types of information:
personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an 
individual basis, and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as 
you and others browse our Web site.</p>

<h3>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide </h3>

<p><b>Registration Information</b><br>
If you register for any of our products, services or newsletters you will provide us information about yourself.</p>

<p><b>Email Information</b><br>
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with 
your email address and our responses.</p>

<h3>2. Website Use Information</h3>

<p>Similar to other websites, this website utilizes a standard 
technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web 
server log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. 
Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at this website, and the websites visited just before and just after 
this one.</p>

<p><b>In addition, third parties may be placing and reading cookies on your browser, 
or using web beacons to collect information, in the course of ads being served on 
this website.</b> </p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. 
The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, 
your ISP (internet service provider), the browser you used to visit our site 
(such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which 
pages you visited throughout our site.</p>

<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>

<p>We may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when 
you visit our site. Their use may allow us, for example, to show you only one 
popup per visit.</p>

<h3>Advertisements</h3>

<p>We may also use third party advertisements to support this site. Some of our 
advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they 
advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google 
through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your 
ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you 
have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing 
UK-based ads to someone in the UK, for example) or showing certain ads based on 
specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents 
cooking sites).</p>

<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you 
visit this website. These companies may use aggregated information (not 
including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your 
visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about 
goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about 
this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by 
these companies, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="nofollow">
click here</a>.</p>

<p><b>AOL Cookies</b><br>
Third party cookies may be placed when serving advertisements on this website including but not limited to those set by AOL. 
Read <a href="http://privacy.aol.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AOL's privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p><b>DoubleClick DART cookies</b><br>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which 
places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site 
using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). 
This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest 
based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous 
browsing history. DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does 
NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, 
physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account 
numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites 
using this advertising by visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" rel="nofollow">
http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>. </p>
<h3>Social Networks</h3>
<p>These days our visitors like to share content from Activity Village through social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google+. We therefore have "like" and 
"add" buttons throughout the site that allow people to easily share to those networks. In some cases when we include these social 'plugins', it gives those 
sites the flexibility to use cookies. </p>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>On some pages in this website we showcase YouTube videos. If you watch one of these videos, YouTube may store cookies in order to track how people are 
watching videos. </p>

<h2>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? </h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our
business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to 
monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and 
improve our content and service offerings, and customize our site's content, 
layout, services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and 
better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis.
Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared 
with parties except as required by law.</p>

<p>Occasionally, if you have opted into a newsletter we may provide, we may also 
use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our 
website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You 
may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing 
us at the link provided on the newsletter.</p>

<h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique 
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer 
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically 
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if 
your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser 
only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not 
the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept 
cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the 
configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your 
browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not 
function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any 
other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>

<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your 
browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet 
Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as 
well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or 
programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>

<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising 
program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit 
a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
<p><b><font size="2">You can read more about cookies and find detailed information for managing your cookies here:

<h2>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h2>

<p>As you visit and browse this website, the site uses cookies to differentiate you 
from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having 
to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our 
web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us 
gather feedback to constantly improve our website and better serve our clients. </p>
<p>We make use of a tool from Google called Google Analytics. The Google Analytics software is described 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit 
<a target="_blank" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 

</p> 

<p>Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal 
information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>

<h2>IP Addresses</h2>

<p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the 
Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network 
to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web 
server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that 
data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>

<h2>Sharing and Selling Information</h2>

<p>We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely 
identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to 
the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you 
have requested.</p>

<h2>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</h2>

<p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, 
when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection 
of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have 
reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of 
Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>

<h2>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Website?</h2>

<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from 
our website or the information or content contained therein. Often links to 
other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that 
may be useful to the users of our website.</p>

<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another web 
site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction 
on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is 
subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules 
and policies before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Newsletter Opt-in and Opt-out</h2>
<p>It is easy for newsletter subscribers to unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time that they will not receive future 
messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</p>

<h2>A Special Note About Children </h2>

<p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that 
children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If 
you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission 
and guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>

<h2>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</h2>

<p>In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its assets) is 
acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may be part of 
those assets that are transferred.</p>

<h2>Policy Modifications</h2>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to 
this privacy policy, we may email users who have given us permission to do so. 
We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, 
please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not 
use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy 
in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without 
your prior consent.</p>
