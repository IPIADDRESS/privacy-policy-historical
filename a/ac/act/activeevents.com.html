        <p>
            Active will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to

            Business Transitions</h1>
        <p>
            In the event Active goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition
            by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable
            information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via
            email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership
            or control of your personal information.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Security</h1>
        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
            information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we

        <p>
            We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable
            information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
            method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
            secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means
            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
