<p>
ActiveState is committed to respecting your right to privacy while using our
site. This Privacy Policy contains information regarding our privacy
practices for the entire ActiveState site (including www.ActiveState.com and
ASPN.ActiveState.com).
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Information Collection and Use</font><br>
ActiveState is the sole owner of the customer information collected on this
site. We will not share this information in any ways other than those
disclosed in this statement. ActiveState collects information from our users
at several points on our website.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Information Requests</font><br>
Throughout our site, you are provided with the opportunity to contact us via
email to ask questions, request information and materials, register for
online presentations, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be
offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you to
provide information about our products or services. We may request
additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone
number, to help us satisfy your request.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Cookies</font><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, containing
information about the user. Usage of a cookie provides user benefits and is
in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our
site. For example, by setting a cookie on our site a user would not have to
enter a password more than once. If a user rejects the cookie, they may
still use our site, though some areas may be functionally limited. For
example, a user will not be able to take full advantage of our mailing list
subscription tools. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
of our users to enhance the onsite experience.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Log Files</font><br>
Our website servers generate standard traffic log files. We use these files
to prepare aggregate traffic statistics for our site. There is no
personally-identifiable information in these log files. We use IP addresses
and cookie values to analyze trends, administer the site, track users'
movements, and gather broad demographic information to improve the
performance of our site.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Requested Services and Product Evaluations</font><br>
We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to
issues relating to their account via email or phone. Two expiration reminder
notices are sent by email to users who have obtained a trial license for one
of our products.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Language Downloads</font><br>
When a user downloads one of the free ActiveState language distributions,
they will be given the option of opting in to receive marketing material and
information on free programming resources via email.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">ASPN Membership</font><br>
When a user enrolls for free membership in ASPN Open, they will be asked to
provide certain personal information in order for us to create their online
account. The user will also be given the option of opting in to receive
marketing material via email.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Ordering</font><br>
We request user information on our order form. A user may be asked to
provide contact information (e.g. name and shipping address) and financial
information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is
used for billing purposes and to fulfill orders. If we have difficulty
processing an order, the contact information is used to contact the
customer.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Surveys &amp; Contests</font><br>
From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
and the user can decide whether or not to disclose their information.
Information requested may include contact information (such as name and
shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age
range). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award
prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of improving our
products and our site.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Mailing lists</font><br>
Users are offered the option of subscribing to relevant mailing lists at the
time of purchase, and at various other locations throughout the site, for
reasons of user convenience only. All new mailing list subscribers will
receive a welcome email verifying subscription information. ActiveState's
ASPN "Announce" mailing lists are "receive-only" lists for announcements
regarding ActiveState products, services, or promotions. ActiveState's ASPN
"Discuss" mailing lists are moderated lists that provide discussion forums
for ActiveState products and technologies. It is not necessary to subscribe
to any ASPN mailing list to use our Web site or purchase our products.
</p>
<p>
ASPN includes archives of mailing lists hosted by other sites. ActiveState
does not control or own the data collected from these lists. For information
regarding the data collection practices of the hosting site, please contact
them directly.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Security</font><br>
Our Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
a user submits sensitive information, the information is protected both
online and offline. Where our registration/order form requires sensitive
information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted
with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure
page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked,
as opposed to unlocked or open.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Suppliers</font><br>
We outsource shipping and credit card processing. The companies that perform
these services do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
information for any secondary purposes.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Links</font><br>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that
ActiveState is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We
encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site, and to read the
privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
information collected by the ActiveState Web site.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Public Forums</font><br>
ASPN makes mailing list archives, chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or
news groups available to its users. As any information that is disclosed in
these areas becomes public, caution should be exercised when disclosing
personal information.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Choice/Opt-in</font><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to having their information
used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask
for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-in" mechanism
so purchasers who wish to receive marketing material can add their email
address to our lists. We only add users to our lists when they expressly
agree to be added.
</p>
<p>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being
collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an
informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require
an outside party, or not.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Opting Out</font><br>
Periodically, ActiveState notifies our users of new products, announcements,
upgrades, and updates.
</p>
<p>
If you would prefer not to receive these notifications, please update your
preferences at: <a href="/cgibin/ns.plex">http://www.ActiveState.com/cgibin/ns.plex</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding
the initial use, evaluation, or expiration of our products or services.
</p>
<!--
If you are a member of ASPN Perl or ASPN Tcl, the information you provide to
us is used only to send you further notifications needed to support the
product, i.e. update and upgrade announcements and account expiration
reminders. Since we do not send you non-essential communications using your
ASPN designation, there is no need to indicate an opt-out preference.
-->
<p>
<font class="subheading">Notification of Changes</font><br>
If we change our privacy policy, we will post notification of those changes
on our homepage so our users are aware changes to the information we
collect, how it is used, and under which circumstances, if any, it is
disclosed. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collec
ted, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether
or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use
information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
information was collected.
</p>
<p>
<font class="subheading">Questions</font><br>
If you have questions, or if you feel we are in violation of this privacy
policy, please email website-feedback@ActiveState.com.
