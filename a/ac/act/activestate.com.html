<p>
   ActiveState is committed to respecting your right to privacy while using our
   site. This Privacy Policy contains information regarding our privacy
   practices for the entire ActiveState site (including www.activestate.com and
   aspn.activestate.com).
</p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
   ActiveState is the sole owner of the customer information collected on this
   site. We will not share this information in any ways other than those
   disclosed in this statement. ActiveState collects information from our users
   at several points on our website.
</p>
<h2>Information Requests</h2>
<p>
   Throughout our site, you are provided with the opportunity to contact us via
   email to ask questions, request information and materials, register for
   online presentations, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be
   offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you to
   provide information about our products or services. We may request
   additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone
   number, to help us satisfy your request.
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
   A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive, containing
   information about the user. Usage of a cookie provides user benefits and is
   in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. For example, 
   by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to
   enter your password more than once. If you reject the cookie, you may
   still use our site, though some areas may be functionally limited. For
   example, you will not be able to take full advantage of our mailing list
   subscription tools. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests
   of our users to enhance the onsite experience.
</p>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>
   Our website servers generate standard traffic log files. We use these files
   to prepare aggregate traffic statistics for our site. There is no
   personally identifiable information in these log files. We use IP addresses
   and cookie values to analyze trends, administer the site, track users'
   movements, and gather broad demographic information to improve the
   performance of our site.
</p>
<h2>Requested Services and Product Evaluations</h2>
<p>
   We communicate with our users to provide requested services, and in regard to
   issues relating to their account via email or phone. Three expiration reminder notices 
   are sent by email for all Pro Studio bundle subscriptions. Two expiration reminder
   notices are sent by email to users who have obtained at trial license for 
   any of our products.
</p>
<!--
<h2>Webcast Registration</h2>
<p>
   When you register to attend or view an ActiveState webcast, a third party 
   provider will request personally identifiable information such as: email 
   address, first name, last name, company, title, etc. By registering for a 
   webcast, you agree to be contacted by an ActiveState representative regarding 
   the product or service featured in the webcast.
</p>

<p>
   ActiveState does not control or own the data collected from the webcast 
   registration process. For information regarding the data collection practices 
   of the third party provider site, please contact them directly.
</p>
-->
<h2>Language Downloads</h2>
<p>
   When a user downloads one of the free ActiveState language distributions,
   they will be given the option of opting in to receive marketing material and
   information on free programming resources via email.
</p>
<h2>ASPN Membership</h2>
<p>
   When a user enrolls for free membership in ASPN Open, they will be asked to
   provide certain personal information in order for us to create their online
   account. The user will also be given the option of opting in to receive
   marketing material via email.
</p>
<h2>Ordering</h2>
<p>
   We request user information during the account setup and purchase processes.
   Users may be asked to
   provide contact information (e.g. name and shipping address) and financial
   information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date). This information is
   used for billing and order fulfillment. If we have difficulty
   processing an order, the contact information may be used to contact the
   customer.
</p>
<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
<p>
   From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or
   contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
   and the user can decide whether or not to disclose their information.
   Information requested may include contact information (such as name and
   shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age
   range). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award
   prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of improving our
   products and our site.
</p>
<h2>Mailing lists</h2>
<p>
   Users are offered the option of subscribing to relevant mailing lists at the
   time of purchase, and at various other locations throughout the site, for
   reasons of user convenience only. All new mailing list subscribers will
   receive a welcome email verifying subscription information. ActiveState's
   ASPN "Announce" mailing lists are "receive-only" lists for announcements
   regarding ActiveState products, services, or promotions. ActiveState's ASPN
   "Discuss" mailing lists are moderated lists that provide discussion forums
   for ActiveState products and technologies. It is not necessary to subscribe
   to any ASPN mailing list to use our Web site or purchase our products.
</p>
<p>
   ASPN includes archives of mailing lists hosted by other sites. ActiveState
   does not control or own the data collected from these lists. For information
   regarding the data collection practices of the hosting site, please contact
   them directly.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
   Our Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When
   a user submits sensitive information, it is protected both
   online and offline. Where our registration/order form requires sensitive
   information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted
   with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure
   page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
   such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked,
   as opposed to unlocked or open.
</p>
<h2>Suppliers</h2>
<p>
   We outsource shipping and credit card processing. The companies that perform
   these services do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
   information for any secondary purposes.
</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
   This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that
   ActiveState is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We
   encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site, and to read the
   privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally
   identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
   information collected by the ActiveState Web site.
</p>
<h2>Public Forums</h2>
<p>
   ASPN makes mailing list archives, chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or
   news groups available to its users. As any information that is disclosed in
   these areas becomes public, caution should be exercised when disclosing
   personal information.
</p>
<h2>Choice/Opt-in</h2>
<p>
   Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to having their information
   used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask
   for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-in" mechanism
   so purchasers who wish to receive marketing material can add their email
   address to our lists. We only add users to our lists when they expressly
   agree to be added.
</p>
<p>
   Users of our site are always notified when their information is being
   collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an
   informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require
   an outside party, or not.
</p>
<h2>Opting Out</h2>
<p>
   Periodically, ActiveState notifies our users of new products, announcements,
   upgrades, and updates.
</p>
<p>
   If you would prefer not to receive these notifications, please update your
   preferences at: <a href="/cgibin/ns.plex">http://www.ActiveState.com/cgibin/ns.plex</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding
   the initial use, evaluation, or expiration of our products or services.
</p>
<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>
   If we change our privacy policy, we will post notification of those changes
   on our homepage so our users are aware of changes to the information we
   collect, how it is used, and under which circumstances, if any, it is
   disclosed. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
   information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
   we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether
   or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use
   information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
   information was collected.
</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>
   If you have questions, or if you feel we are in violation of this privacy
   policy, please <a href="mailto:website-feedback@ActiveState.com">contact us</a>.
