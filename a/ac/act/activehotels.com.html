        <li>Contact us by e-mail, post or otherwise </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>II. What information do we collect?  How do we use it? </h2>

    <p>The personal information you provide through online collections forms on the site may be used by us for providing you the services you request in the manner described below:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When Booking:
        <ul>
            <li>Our "suppliers" (the hotels on our site) and Active Hotels require certain information to allow us to process your hotel booking and notify you of the booking confirmation. When you book, we will need to know the name of the person making the reservation and a name for each room booked, your name, a postal address and email address, as well as your credit or debit card number, CVC number and expiry date. </li>
            <li>We ask for your telephone number so that we and/or our suppliers' customer support representatives and we can contact you if there is a question concerning your reservation. </li>
            <li>Credit card information is held in our secure database to enable us or our suppliers to process reservations and cancellations.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Special offers:
        <ul>
            <li>From time to time we may have special deals that may be of interest to you. When you book with us, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to receive these communications.</li>
            <li>Every Special Offer email that you receive from us will contain an unsubscribe link. Selecting that link will allow you to opt-out of receiving subsequent communications.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Surveys and Competitions:
        <ul>
            <li>Participation in surveys and competitions is voluntary and you have the choice whether or not to disclose any information. </li>
            <li>We may request information from you via email surveys or competitions. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our site - for example, we may invite your comments on the ease of using our booking service. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hotel Reviews:
        <ul>
            <li>Providing reviews of hotels you have stayed in is voluntary and you have the choice whether or not to disclose any information. </li>
            <li>After you have stayed in one of our member hotels, we may invite you to provide a review of that hotel. You can publish scores and written comments. Your scores and comments are displayed publicly; however, Active Hotels reserves the right to remove the scores and comments published by you and may contact you, concerning your scores and written comments, if you have not followed the <a href="/hotel/static/en/terms.html#posting">Rules of Posting</a>.</li>
            <li>Your first name, town and country are automatically displayed with the reviews and comments you publish unless you change this default configuration. </li>
            <li>Your booking reference number is displayed so that hotels may reply to your comments.</li>
            <li>You retain all ownership rights to content you publish on Active Hotels (your “Content”).  However, we can publish all or teaser portions of your Content online and offline and permit others to do the same.  </li>
            <li>We, and our licensees, can republish your Content. We may publish product ratings and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise products. We may use your review ratings to personalize site views. For example, we may promote most popular or high-scoring hotels on our website. </li>
            <li>While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this statement), we use the review database throughout our networks and to generate results for others.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Newsletters:
        <ul>
            <li>You also may have the option to subscribe to our newsletter. If so, we ask for contact information such as your name and email address.</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>III. Personal Information of Third Parties</h2>

    <p>If you provide us with personal information about other individuals in order to make a booking through this site, it is your responsibility to inform that person about his/her rights and to obtain the explicit consent of those individuals to the collection, use, processing and transfer of that personal information in the manner described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>IV. Cookies and Site Tracking</h2>

    <p>We may use "cookies" (detailed below), to enable our site to display in your preferred language, and to measure the proportion of our bookings that originate from customers who have previously booked with us.</p>
    <p>Like many ecommerce sites we use "cookies" to register your preferences. Cookies are a system whereby a message is given to your web browser by our web server. This text message is stored by your browser in a text file called something like ‘yourname@activereservations.txt’.</p>
    <p>Each time the browser requests a page from our server, this text message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to allow our server to identify visitors to the website and gives us the opportunity to tailor the site to your needs. For example, if you choose to view the site in French, we may set a "cookie" on your machine so that the next time you return to the site, it is automatically shown in French.</p>
    <p>You may disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly.  You may need to configure your browser to notify you when it is about to place a cookie on your machine and you can then decide if you want to accept the cookie or not.  The exact procedure will vary from browser to browser.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  However, if you choose not to accept cookies, you may have a less satisfactory experience on the site.</p>
    <p>Your access provider assigns an IP address to your computer when you use the Internet. We log each IP address that accesses the site, along with referring/destination URLs. We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, identify fraudulent activity, resolve disputes, and address complaints.</p>

    <h2>V. Data Changes</h2>

    <p>We work to keep personal information accurate and up-to-date. We also work to retain personal information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.  You may request that we edit or</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
