    <h1>I. Our Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This policy describes what you can expect from Active Hotels Websites (a brand of Priceline.com, at Compass House, 80 Newmarket Road, Cambridge CB5 8DZ, United Kingdom) regarding personally identifiable information (“personal information”).</p>
    <p>This policy is a part of the Active Hotels Terms and Conditions. It does not address anyone else's practices or our practices beyond the Active Hotels site.</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy, and take our responsibilities regarding the privacy of your information very seriously.  This policy explains how we use your information and how we protect your privacy.</p>
    <p>We use the latest Secure Sockets security protocols. When you book using our secure servers, all of your personal details are encrypted. This means that your information, which includes your name, address, and credit or debit card number, cannot be read as it travels over the internet.</p>
    <p>Your information is held in our secure databases located in the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p>We have access to your information in order to process your booking. As required by the applicable Data Protection law, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access and use of your information.</p>
    <p>When do we collect information?</p>
    <p>You may supply us with personal information when you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Book a hotel through the website</li>
        <li>Provide us with a review of the hotel after you have stayed there</li>
        <li>Contact us by e-mail, post or otherwise </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="arrow">II. What information do we collect?  How do we use it? </h2>

    <p>The personal information you provide through online collections forms on the site may be used by us for providing you the services you request in the manner described below:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When Booking:
        <ul>
            <li>Our suppliers (the hotels on our site) and Active Hotels require certain information to allow us to process your hotel booking and notify you of the booking confirmation. When you book, we will need to know the name of the person making the reservation and a name for each room booked, your name, a postal address and email address, as well as your credit or debit card number, CVC number and expiry date. </li>
            <li>We ask for your telephone number so that we and/or our suppliers' customer support representatives and we can contact you if there is a question concerning your reservation. </li>
            <li>Credit card information is held in our secure database to enable us or our suppliers to process reservations and cancellations.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Special offers:
        <ul>
            <li>From time to time we may have special deals that may be of interest to you. When you book with us, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to receive these communications.</li>
            <li>Every Special Offer email that you receive from us will contain an unsubscribe link. Selecting that link will allow you to opt-out of receiving subsequent communications.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Surveys and Competitions:
        <ul>
            <li>Participation in surveys and competitions is voluntary and you have the choice whether or not to disclose any information. </li>
            <li>We may request information from you via email surveys or competitions. Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our site - for example, we may invite your comments on the ease of using our booking service. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hotel Reviews:
        <ul>
            <li>Providing reviews of hotels you have stayed in is voluntary and you have the choice whether or not to disclose any information. </li>
            <li>After you have stayed in one of our member hotels, we may invite you to provide a review of that hotel. You can publish scores and written comments. Your scores and comments are displayed publicly; however, Active Hotels reserves the right to remove the scores and comments published by you and may contact you, concerning your scores and written comments, if you have not followed the <a href="/hotel/static/en/terms.html#posting" rel="nofollow">Rules of Posting</a>.</li>
            <li>Your first name, town and country are automatically displayed with the reviews and comments you publish unless you change this default configuration. </li>
            <li>Your booking reference number is displayed so that hotels may reply to your comments.</li>
            <li>You retain all ownership rights to content you publish on Active Hotels (your “Content”).  However, we can publish all or teaser portions of your Content online and offline and permit others to do the same.  </li>
            <li>We, and our licensees, can republish your Content. We may publish product ratings and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise products. We may use your review ratings to personalize site views. For example, we may promote most popular or high-scoring hotels on our website. </li>
            <li>While we don't expect to transfer the complete review rating database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this statement), we use the review database throughout our networks and to generate results for others.  </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Newsletters:
        <ul>
            <li>You also may have the option to subscribe to our newsletter. If so, we ask for contact information such as your name and email address.</li>
            <li>Every email Newsletter that you receive from us will contain an unsubscribe link. Selecting that link will allow you to opt-out of receiving subsequent communications.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="arrow">III. Personal Information of Third Parties</h2>

    <p>If you provide us with personal information about other individuals in order to make a booking through this site, it is your responsibility to inform that person about his/her rights and to obtain the explicit consent of those individuals to the collection, use, processing and transfer of that personal information in the manner described in this policy.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">IV. Cookies and Site Tracking</h2>

    <p>We may use "cookies" (detailed below), to enable our site to display in your preferred language, and to measure the proportion of our bookings that originate from customers who have previously booked with us.</p>
    <p>Like many ecommerce sites we use "cookies" to register your preferences. Cookies are a system whereby a message is given to your web browser by our web server. This text message is stored by your browser in a text file called something like ‘yourname@activereservations.txt’.</p>
    <p>Each time the browser requests a page from our server, this text message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to allow our server to identify visitors to the website and gives us the opportunity to tailor the site to your needs. For example, if you choose to view the site in French, we may set a "cookie" on your machine so that the next time you return to the site, it is automatically shown in French.</p>
    <p>You may disable cookies by setting your browser accordingly.  You may need to configure your browser to notify you when it is about to place a cookie on your machine and you can then decide if you want to accept the cookie or not.  The exact procedure will vary from browser to browser.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  However, if you choose not to accept cookies, you may have a less satisfactory experience on the site.</p>
    <p>Your access provider assigns an IP address to your computer when you use the Internet. We log each IP address that accesses the site, along with referring/destination URLs. We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, identify fraudulent activity, resolve disputes, and address complaints.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">V. Data Changes</h2>

    <p>We work to keep personal information accurate and up-to-date. We also work to retain personal information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.  You may request that we edit or remove your personal information from activereservations.com at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@activehotels.com">privacy@activehotels.com</a></p>
    <p>We reserve the right, without notice, to amend or delete any data or personal information on the site which, in our sole discretion, is defamatory, obscene or materially inaccurate or in breach of any law or advertising code of practice.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">VI. Sharing information</h2>

    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information.  We may share personal information with certain permitted third parties such as subsidiaries and other members of our own group, our member hotels, our professional advisors, and a small number of trusted partners who process data under our strict instructions for the sole purpose of providing the services you have requested. Some of these third parties may be located in countries not offering an equivalent level of protection to that of the European Economic Area.</p>
    <p><strong>Agents:</strong> Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks.  For example, we hire companies to help us handle mail and email (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and email), analyze the data we collect, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service.  The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to personal information to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We require all agents to which personal information is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect your personal information, to apply appropriate technical and organizational security measures to help protect your personal information, and to only process your personal information in accordance with instructions received from us.</p>
    <p><strong>Suppliers:</strong> When you use activereservations.com to reserve a hotel room, we provide personal information to the hotel and other third-parties that help facilitate the transaction.</p>
    <p><strong>Aggregate Statistics:</strong>  We may share aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and reservations with our respective suppliers and partners, but these statistics do not include any personally identifying information.</p>
    <p><strong>Government Relations, Litigation and Fraud Prevention:</strong>  We may disclose personal information about you to the government if we are required to do so by law or regulation, or if we think the disclosure is appropriate and you authorize these disclosures. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential litigation (a) if we are required to do so by law or a court decision, (b) with your consent, if such disclosures may potentially mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights, or (d) to assist the police with the detection and prevention of on-line fraud.</p>
    <p><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong>  We may share personal information with third parties if certain emergency situations require it.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">VII. Sale of Business</h2>
    <p>If our business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers, which may be located in countries not offering an equivalent level of protection to that of the European Economic Area and will be passed on to the new owners of the business so that the new owners can continue to offer the services currently offered by us.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">VIII. Links</h2>
    <p>Any external links from our web site are provided for convenience and purely informational purposes. While we try to find sites that are of value to you, which we believe in good faith provide lawful content and do not infringe applicable laws, we cannot be held responsible for any content, political views or endorsements that may be found in any of our external links. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">IX. Your consent</h2>
    <p>By clicking on the “Confirm Reservation” button on our web site, you consent to the collection, processing, use and transfer of your personal information by both us and, where relevant, permitted third parties in the ways described in this policy.</p>
    <p>An up-to-date privacy policy will be maintained on this site so you are always aware, how we process your personal information use it, and in what circumstances we disclose it. If you have any questions about this privacy statement or would like more information about us, email <a href="mailto:privacy@activehotels.com">privacy@activehotels.com</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="arrow">X. Data access</h2>
    <p>In accordance with the applicable data protection law, you are entitled to request details of the personal information we hold about you, and you have among other rights set forth by the applicable law the following rights:  you can access, modify, object or revoke for legitimate reasons your consent to the processing of your personal information in accordance with this policy.  You can do so by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@activehotels.com">privacy@activehotels.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you become aware that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we amend it. Any requests should be made in writing to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@activehotels.com">privacy@activehotels.com</a>.</p>
