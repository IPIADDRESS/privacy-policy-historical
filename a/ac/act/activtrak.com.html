<p>Birch Grove Software, Inc. (hereinafter, âActivTrak,â âwe,â âus,â and âourâ) respects your privacy and has instituted this Privacy Policy to protect you. Please read on to learn how we collect and use information obtained from this website. By visiting the ActivTrak.com website and domain name, or otherwise accessing any other linked pages, features, content, products, services or applications offered from time to time by ActivTrak in connection therewith (collectively, the âWebsiteâ), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept such practices and policies, you may not use the Website.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, contact us at support@bgrove.com</p>
<h2>SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs ActivTrakâs treatment of personally identifiable information (âPersonal Informationâ) that ActivTrak gathers when you access the Website and when you use ActivTrakâs services or applications. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ActivTrak does not own or control, or to individuals that ActivTrak does not employ or manage.</p>
<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>
<h2>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h2>
<p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information we collect include without limitation your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some features. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new services.</p>
<h2>Personal Information Collected Automatically</h2>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. ActivTrak automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</p>
<p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. ActivTrak only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, ActivTrak never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
<h2>Information collected by ActivTrak Agent</h2>
<p>In order to use the service, you will be required to download and install a software application onto computers that you wish to monitor as part of the service. This software, ActivTrak Agent, collects information about the userâs use of the computer that may extend beyond the information collected as part of registration, including without limitation user behavior data such as application usage, website visits, screenshots and idle time. Every account has itâs own unique agent associated with it. An ActivTrak Agent created for you will only report data to your account.</p>
<p>ActivTrak Agent is not a keystroke-logging application it does not record any keystrokes or mouse movements.</p>
<p>Information collected by ActivTrak Agent will only be available to registered users on your ActivTrak account. Administrative users have the ability to delete data that is collected by ActivTrak Agent, and no copy will be retained by the company.</p>
<h2>Email Communications</h2>
<p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from ActivTrak if your computer supports this type of program. ActivTrak uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>
<p>When you receive marketing and promotional email from ActivTrak, you may opt out of receiving further e-mails of those types by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. ActivTrak may send you administrative and customer service-related email messages for which you may not be given the option to unsubscribe. For example, you may receive messages about your account, the provisioning of requested services, system status update messages, and service and security announcements which are mandatory. If you no longer wish to receive administrative and customer-service-related email messages, you must deactivate your ActivTrak account.</p>
<h2>Information from Other Sources</h2>
<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information. For instance, as part of the configuration of ActivTrak, your account administrator may provide information about you, in order to help you make best use of our system.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>In order to provide you with thorough and personalized service, ActivTrak uses âcookiesâ to keep and occasionally track information about you. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computerâs hard drive. ActivTrak sometimes uses cookies to track information for our usersâ convenience and to understand our customers better. The cookies that are gathered by ActivTrak are only used by ActivTrak. At no time do we share information from cookies with third parties.</p>
<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Websiteâs most attractive features.</p>
<h2>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described immediately below.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong> We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of business entities. In certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through the Website. In other situations, ActivTrak may provide services jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p>
<p><strong>Agents:</strong> We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, ActivTrakâs agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that ActivTrak or substantially all of its assets are acquired, ActivTrak may transfer your Personal Information without your prior notification or consent as one of the transferred business assets.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of ActivTrak and Other Parties:</strong> ActivTrak releases Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ActivTrak, our users, or others.</p>
<p><strong>With ActivTrak Personnel:</strong> Every ActivTrak account may have one or more account administrators who can configure and manage your ActivTrak account on behalf of you and your organization. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with your account administrators.</p>
<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
<h2>CONDITIONS OF USE</h2>
<p>If you decide to visit the ActivTrak website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of Texas state law.</p>
<p>Please note that you could be directed to another site while using ActivTrak. When you link to another site, you should review their privacy policy, as it may be different from this Privacy Policy. Such sites may send their own cookies to users and otherwise collect data or solicit personal information. ActivTrak is not responsible, and shall not be liable, for the privacy practices of linked sites or any use such sites may make of any information collected from you. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by ActivTrak.</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Your ActivTrak account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p>ActivTrak takes precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Information and strives to keep it accurate. However, we cannot guarantee that hackers or unauthorized personnel may gain access to your Personal Information despite our efforts.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to other parties on sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. ActivTrak does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<h2>OPTING IN AND OUT</h2>
<p>You can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of certain features of the Website and services.</p>
<p>You are able to add or update certain information on pages. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.</p>
<p>You can choose to unsubscribe from our e-mail publications as outlined in the âE-mail Communicationsâ section above. When we make changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, or other legal notices we may notify you by email even if you opt out of our e-mail communications. Notwithstanding any e-mail notifications, or lack thereof, your use of the Website is still be governed by the most current version of the Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and other legal notices on our Website and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Children should not submit any Personal Information without the permission of their parents or guardians. ActivTrak encourages all parents or guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet. ActivTrak will not allow children under the age of thirteen (13) to use the Website or the services.
