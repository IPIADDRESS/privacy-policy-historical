It may also include information on the content, products, or services you have shown interest in or may be interested in purchasing from us, as well as information on other companies or individuals with whom you do business. We may also obtain Personal Information about you from third parties in connection with business transactions you initiate with us, such as through credit verification or other processes related to the transaction. &nbsp;Finally, if you interact with a third party service when using our Sites, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our Sites (e.g., Facebook Connect, Google Sign-In, or Twitter OAuth), or if you share content from our Sites through a third party social media service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing. All Personal Information received from third parties will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANALYTIC TECHNOLOGIES</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use certain common methods and technologies to collect and store Usage Information about your interaction with our Sites (“</span><b>Analytic Technologies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).

The specific Analytic Technologies that we use are as follows:</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;A cookie is a data file placed on Your Device when you visit our Sites. We use cookies only to facilitate the use and navigation of our Sites and to remember you and your preferences in case you revisit our Sites in the future and to conduct range measurement. Many browsers allow blocking of cookies in their entirety, removal of existing cookies, or warning to prevent the placing of a cookie. Please note that blocking of cookies might impede your use of our Sites. For more information, please see our Cookie Policy </span><a href="/cookie-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.ActivTrak.com/cookie-policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a resident of the EU or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our Sites, then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on such Sites; except that certain cookies are essential to enable core site functionality, and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Beacons. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A web beacon, including tracking pixels, is a small graphic image or other web programming code, also known as “1×1 GIF” or “clear GIF.” We may download web beacons to Your Device when you access our Sites or through email messages that we send to you. Web beacons are used to improve your experience on our Sites. Web beacons also help us to understand whether users read email messages and click on the links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and messages. Our web beacons may collect certain of your contact information (e.g., the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded Scripts.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with our Sites, such as which links within our Sites you click on, which type of browser or device you use (e.g. mobile or desktop version). We use such information to enhance the user experience. This code is downloaded onto Your Device when you access our Sites and is deactivated or deleted when you leave our Sites. Identification of the user does not take place.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analytics.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We use analytics applications, including “Google Analytics”, to collect information about use of our Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they visited prior to coming to a website. We use the information obtained from these applications only to improve our Sites and our product and service offerings. The information generated about your use of our Sites will be transferred and saved to the vendor’s server in the United States. For Google Analytics, within Member States of the European Union or other signatories of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google will first shorten your IP address. In exceptional cases, the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the United States to be shortened there. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics Terms of Use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by visiting&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</span></a></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Track Policy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Sites. Just like any other Usage Information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Sites and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Sites and after you leave our Sites.</span></p><h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">CUSTOMER END USER DATA</span></h1><p><b>This privacy policy does not apply to customer end user data.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;With respect to our customers, we are a data processor, and we process the personal data collected by our customers only in accordance with the instructions of our customers.

If you are a Customer End User and you would like to access, amend or delete your data, then you need to contact the customer directly, and we will respond within a reasonable period of time to any such request by our customer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</span></p><p><b>Business Use.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We use your Personal Information primarily to facilitate our ongoing and proposed business dealings with you (“</span><b>Business Use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”).

We receive such Personal Information because you have consented towards the third party that they might share your Personal Information. If we use that information to contact you, it will only be to see if you are interested in our products or services, or those of our business partners. We will not use this information for other purposes without your consent. In addition, if you inform us that you are not interested in these products or services, we will stop using the information to contact you.</span></p><p><b>Data Integrity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;You are responsible for the accuracy of all Personal Information that you provide to us. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and integrity of your Personal Information, and to update that information as appropriate.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, prior to allowing our Data Processors to access your Personal Information, we will enter into a data protection agreement or addendum (“</span><b>DPA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) with them to ensure that they handle and process the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law as instructed by us.</span></p><p><b>Partners</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We may also share your contact information with the following partners so that we can better serve you:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributors and resellers: if you are in a location where we primarily sell our products and services through a distributor or reseller, we may pass your contact information on to such distributor or reseller so that they can contact you directly about your interest in ActivTrak’s products and services. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed Service Providers: we may share your contact information with third parties that provide an offering or service that runs the ActivTrak product for you.

Thus, your Personal Information associated with our Sites may be transferred to and/or processed in a country other than that from which it was collected. The data protection laws in those countries may differ from those of the country in which you are located. The servers may be operated by third party hosted service providers. &nbsp;If you are a resident of the EU, any such transfers will be made in accordance with applicable laws. </span></p><p><b>Links to Other Websites and Applications.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The Sites may contain various links to, as well as plug-ins or widgets from, social media and other third-party websites or applications, which may provide additional information, goods, services, and/or promotions. These third-party websites or applications are owned and operated independently of ActivTrak, and may have their own separate privacy and data collection practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party; therefore, you should review their privacy policies and practices prior to interacting with their websites or applications, using any of their tools, or sharing any of your Personal Information with them.</span></p><p><b>Community Forums.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Our Sites may offer message boards, chat rooms, blogs, and other public areas (“</span><b>Community Forums</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) where you can interact with our employees, other customers, post images, data, requests, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content, including your Personal Information (“</span><b>User Submissions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”). To participate in Community Forums, you may be asked to select a user name and password and/or provide us with your email-address, and to agree to the terms of participation for those Community Forums. We use this information to identify you and to contact you, if needed, for the provision of those Community Forums. You are able to change your email preferences or discontinue your participation in the Community Forums at any time. Your password and your email-address will not be visible to other users or shared with third parties. You should be aware that any User Submissions you post to a Community Forum, as well as your user name, may be viewed by other members of that forum. If you choose to voluntarily post User Submissions to a Community Forum, be aware that such information is viewable by anyone else on that Community Forum. Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information in a Community Forum. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Submission that you disclose or receive through a Community Forum. We might also delete User Submissions without further notice if they include harmful or inappropriate content (e.g., pornographic material, content encouraging vandalism, crime, terrorism, racism, violence, or cruelty), or infringe any third party’s rights or applicable law.</span></p><p><b>Promotions.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We may offer various promotions (“</span><b>Promotions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) through the Sites or elsewhere that may require registration with your Personal Information. If you choose to enter or otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with administration of the Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as otherwise required by law. By entering into a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. These rules will be displayed to you during the registration process, and you will be asked for your consent to the respective data processing at that time.</span></p><p><b>Affiliates and Business Transfers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates. Additionally, ActivTrak or any part of its business, including our Sites, may be sold at some point in the future. Should this occur, your Personal Information may be transferred to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the business unit or Sites. We also may disclose and transfer your Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of stock or assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process. In all such cases, this Privacy Policy will continue to govern the use and disclosure of such information.</span></p><p><b>Legal Protections and Law Enforcement.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We may access, use, preserve, transfer, and disclose to third parties your Personal Information to: (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, governmental request, or legal process if, in our good faith opinion, such is required or permitted by law; (2) protect and/or defend this Privacy Policy or other policies or terms of use applicable to our Sites, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (3) protect the safety, rights, property, or security of ActivTrak or any third party; and/or (4) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security issues or breaches, or technical issues. This may include allowing third parties, such as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, and/or law enforcement agencies, to access and use your Usage Information in order to identify you.
