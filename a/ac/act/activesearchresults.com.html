<br>
<dt>What Information Does Active Search Results Collect From You?</dt>
<br>
<dd>
<p>You can visit our site and use most of our services
without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally
identifiable information to us. There are, however, times
where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to
fulfill your request.</p> 
<p>Whenever you visit Active Search Results, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information 
from your web browser including your IP Address, Active Search Results information, the Active Search Results page(s) 
you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.</p>
<p>Active Search Results uses this anonymous information to customize your experience
on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to
improve our services in general. For example, when you use Active Search Results'
Search Engine, Active Search Results can collect aggregate information such as the web
pages visited and the time spent on each page. This information allows
other users to benefit from the quality searches you perform,
ultimately receiving the most relevant, pertinent information. We
ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific
person.</p>

identifiable information, Active Search Results will not share it with other
companies or individuals unless:</p>
<p>We are responding to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, to establish or 
exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or</p>
<p>If Active Search Results is acquired by another company whether through merger or
purchase of its stock or all or substantially all of its assets, we
will share the information with the acquiring company.</p>
<p> Furthermore, Active Search Results will not sell or disclose your
personally identifiable information as customer lists to anyone. Nor
will we share with anyone personally identifiable information about you
in any manor.</p>

<br>
<dt>How Will You Be Notified if Active Search Results Changes This privacy policy?</dt>

are going to use personally identifiable information in a manner
different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify
you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your
information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any
material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
information already stored in our databases, we will post a prominent
notice on our web site notifying users of the change. Bear in mind that
the only way to ensure your personal privacy whenever you are on the
