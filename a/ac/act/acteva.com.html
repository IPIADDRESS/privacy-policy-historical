		<h3>Website Security</h3>
		<p>When you place an order with Acteva, your personal information 
		is protected as follows:
		</p><ul>
			<p></p><li>All information submitted via web page forms is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol.  This means that whenever you:
				<ul><li>Place an order</li>
					<li>Enter an ID or password</li>
					<li>Submit your personal or credit card information</li>
				</ul>
			<p>...your browser encrypts the information before sending it out over the Internet to our secure server.</p></li>  
			<p></p><li>Special security measures are used to protect communications with our credit card processor. We not only encrypt your credit card data; we also secure a unique connection to the processor(s) just for your purchase authorization.</li>
			<p></p><li>Our Digital ID Certificate was issued by Verisign, Inc., the leading Secure Server Certification Authority. To verify our certificate, or for more information about Verisign, click the icon below.

		</p><h3>Your Personal Data Stays That Way</h3>

		<font size="+1">We consider Acteva customers to be the owners of 
		their own personal information, period.</font>

		<p>We do not now sell or rent information about our customers. If, in 
		the future, we want to share your information with other organizations 
		that we feel can provide you with valuable products or services, we will 
		send you an e-mail message, asking you to "opt-in" to this opportunity.

		</p><p>When you purchase tickets, passes, or reservations through Acteva, 
		we provide the necessary contact information about you to the event, venue, 
		promoter, performer, sponsoring organization, or other involved third 
		party to ensure the successful fulfillment of your activity arrangements.
		We also use information you provide during the ticketing process to 
		customize our site to better meet your specific needs, and to make ongoing 
		improvements to the design and function of the Acteva site as a whole.

		</p><p>When you purchase tickets, we send you an e-mail message 
		confirming the online transaction. At the request of event management, 
		we also may send e-mail notifications of important information that could 
		affect your use of those tickets, such as schedule changes, updates, 
		or cancellations. For these reasons, we require that our customers have 
		valid e-mail addresses.

		</p><p><b>Note:</b> Some event/activity producers will have us send you a 
		reminder email for an event you've booked through Acteva. Those 
		reminders, which typically go out three days before the event or 
		activity, are for your information only.

		</p><h3>You May Hear from Us Again...</h3>
		As a customer of Acteva, you'll be given the opportunity to 
		"opt-in" to our EventAlert system. If you opt-in, you will 
		occasionally receive e-mails from us, notifying you of special promotions 
		or other events related to the events you've attended in the past. 
		We intend these once-in-a-while notices to be helpful, not annoying; 
		we're simply trying to keep you up to date on the types of events and 
		activities in which you've shown an interest. (We won't be sending 
		opera-goers any spam about head-banger concerts, for example, nor will 
		you be getting solicitations from travel companies simply because you 
		attended an out-of-town festival or two.)

		<p>Information on cancelling your EventAlert subscription is included 
		at the bottom of each message. We'll confirm your cancellation request, 
		and you won't get any more notifications. 

		</p><p><font size="+1">Your privacy -- and your confidence in us to protect 
		that privacy -- is more important to us than the incremental income 
		that might come from the sale of your contact or demographic data. If 
		you would like additional information, please
			<a href="mailto:service@tixtogo.com">let us know</a>.

		</p><h4>Purchasing &amp; Ticketing Policies</h4>
		<p>Acteva is not a ticket broker: we are an authorized reseller 
		for the events, venues, and activities that are listed on our Web site. 
		In effect, Acteva serves as a "virtual box office" for you, 
		giving you one-stop shopping for a broad range of things to do, from 
		entertainment to personal and professional development.

		</p><p>The ticketing, seating, and refund policies for each event are 
		defined and enforced by the sponsor, promoter, management, or producer 
		of that event. <b>If there's an issue with your entry to the 
		event/activity, or with the event or performance itself, contact the 
		event/activity producer or sponsor directly.</b> (Event contact 
		information is always included in your confirmation message.)

		</p><p>On the other hand, if there's a problem with the charges or 
		confirmation of your online ticket purchase, contact us at 
		<a href="mailto:service@tixtogo.com">service@tixtogo.com</a> 
		or (877-849-8646 or (415) 442-4849).
