<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Information Collection on the Site</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Our Service allows for an interactive experience by integrating a commenting platform. By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a public comment sharing platform and that we or other Users may search for, see, use, re-post any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Personally Identifiable Information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We use and disclosure of information we collect when users elect to use the activerevenue.com’s widget, visit a publisher web site that includes the activerevenue.com’s widget or uses activerevenue.com Services, or view advertisements we serve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and e-mail address when you register for an activerevenue.com account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). If you purchase services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information about you from third parties, including, for example, information about your transactions, purchase history, or relationships with various product and service providers, and your use of certain applications.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We collect information when you visit our web site, use or interact with activerevenue.com services, when you visit our partner publishers’ web sites that use our widget or activerevenue.com services, and when you view or click advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf. This information could include general click stream behavior such as web pages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages), search queries from which users are directed to a page, navigation from page to page through the activerevenue.com services, time spent on each page, and items that you click or select (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information also may include IP address, information about your geographic location derived from your IP address and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We also collect and use information about your interactions with the Service in a manner and format that does not identify you as an individual (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”). We may collect, use, and disclose Non-Personally Identifiable Information as set forth below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Cookies Information: Like many websites, we mostly use cookies and pixel tags to collect this Usage Information. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you visit a website; each website can send its own cookies to your browser. A pixel tag is a small graphic file that allows us to measure the use of activerevenue.com services. Pixel tags allow us to collect information such as IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears, the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears, the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag is viewed, and the identification number (the long string of characters) of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Cookies Options: We use cookies to uniquely identify a browser, which gives advertisers the ability to show targeted ads that are relevant to you. If you would prefer us not to store a unique cookie in your browser, you may opt out. Note that by opting out, you still will receive advertising from activerevenue.com when you visit our websites – it just will not be targeted to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Opt out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Analytics Information: We use both our and third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, a number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Clear Gifs/Web Beacons Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Information Collection on Partner Sites</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We may receive, transfer and collect information from users of third party sites which use the activerevenue.com service (“Partner Sites”) about you and your usage of the activerevenue.com Service on their sites. Unless you have allowed the Partner Site to share Personally Identifiable Information, such information will not include Personally Identifiable Information but may include Non-Personally Identifiable Information and/or report anonymous information about your usage of the Partner Site and the activerevenue.com Service on that site.</span></p>

We will use these Audience Segments (a) to match advertisements that may be of interest to our users that fall within that segment and (b) to assist our advertisers, ad networks, and publisher web sites to deliver advertisements and offers that may be of interest to users within a given segment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, a number of clicks, etc.):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">in any manner permitted for Personally Identifiable Information; and</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We may share non-aggregate, non-personally identifiable Usage Information, including audience segments, with third party advertisers and publishers to assist us and them in delivering relevant, targeted advertising that is aligned with user interests. For example, these companies may use such information (e.g., click stream information, time and date, the subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Your preferences collected through this process may be used to influence which types of marketing messages you receive across sites that we work with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">We may also share aggregate statistical information about our services with advertisers and publishers. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third parties.</span></p>

These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. activerevenue.com does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.</span></p>

In that situation, activerevenue.com determines the target audience and activerevenue.com serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</span></p>
