	 <p class="articletitle">ActiveAuthors.com Privacy Policy</p>
	 <p>ActiveAuthors.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages
		of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
		experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
		address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy
		policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any
		unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
	 <p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
	 <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
		visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
		provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
		register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
		features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide
		information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards
		and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,
		ActiveAuthors.com also collects information automatically and through the
		use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example,
		we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology
		to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
		cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to
		re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of
		times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
		adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other
		means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
		example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you
		may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
		re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the
		site's features according to your preferences.</p>
	 <p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
	 <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
		and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
		privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
	 <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
		you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about
		your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
		enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or
		what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be
		shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does
		not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone
		to identify you individually.</p>
	 <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
		www.ActiveAuthors.com to communicate with you about your registration and
		customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
		and products offered by www.ActiveAuthors.com and other topics we think you
		might find of interest.</p>
	 <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by ActiveAuthors.com
		may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
		administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
		administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
		Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
		site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
		use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time
		as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
		other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
		among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
		to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
		do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
		and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
		necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure
		in such cases.</p>
	 <p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
	 <p>ActiveAuthors.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates
		to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,
		including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
		accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection
		policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link
		to, or view as part of a frame on a www.ActiveAuthors.com page, certain
		content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
		ActiveAuthors.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
		information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
		parties. ActiveAuthors.com is not responsible for the actions or policies
		of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of
		those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by
		a third party.</p>
	 <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
		parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
		preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
		advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the
		advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
		before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by
		third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
		ActiveAuthors.com does not control the use of this technology by third
		parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or
		policies of such third parties.</p>
	 <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
		Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information
		can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
		our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
		third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ActiveAuthors.com
		and this policy. </p>
	 <p><b>Children</b></p>
	 <p>ActiveAuthors.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
		Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by
		law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in
		violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you
		believe ActiveAuthors.com has any information from or about anyone under
		13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
	 <p><b>Contacting Us</b></p>
	 <p>We can be reached by emailing us.</p>
	 <p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
	 <p>ActiveAuthors.com reserves the right to change this policy at any
		time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
		our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
		those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted
		will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the
		information was collected.</p>
	 <p><b>Governing law</b></p>
	 <p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a
		dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the
		help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Austin. Any
		costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be
		shared equally by each of us.</p>
	 <p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution
		through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the
		following location: Austin, under the rules of the American Arbitration
		Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered
		in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
	 <p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and
		do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
		party.</p>
