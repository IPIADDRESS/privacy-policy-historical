      From time to time, We may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they click on.
      This information represents a generic overview of our users.
      Collective viewing habits and allows Us and other third parties to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior.
      We collect this information through the use of technologies such as 'cookies', which are discussed in greater detail in this Privacy Policy.
      We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Sites are most popular and to enhance the Sites for visitors.
      We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Sites to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
      From time to time, We may use this information to optimize third-party offers of products and/or services.
      We also may share aggregated demographic and preference data with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services.
      However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors of the Sites.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
    <p>
      QLS may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of cookies.
      Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website.
      Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising.
      We never save credit card information in cookies.
      Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.
      You may set your browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
      However, please be aware that some features of our Sites may not function or may be slower if you refuse cookies.
      You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the Sites as described below.
      We do not control these cookies.
      The use of advertising cookies sent by third party ad servers is standard in the Internet industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Sites is accessed.

      to confirm compliance with the terms of the promotional offer in which you are participating, to protect our Sites, our customers or others, to prevent, detect and/or mitigate fraud, or when We believe in good faith that the law requires it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Sites may also use technology called 'tracer tags'. These may also be referred to as 'Pixels', 'Clear GIFs' or 'Web Beacons'.
      This technology allows Us to understand which pages you visit on the Sites. These tracer tags are used to help Us to optimize and tailor our Sites for you and other users of our Sites.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pop-up blockers or stoppers prevent extra pop-up windows (usually advertisements) from opening in your browser. Pop-up blocking software often has negative effects on other 'good' software.
      If you disable Java Script pop-up windows, you may also disable other website functionality that uses Java Script.
      If you are using a pop-up blocker that allows you to manage a list of 'pop-up friendly' sites, please refer to your Help files and add the URL of our Sites to your approved list to ensure maximum functionality at the Sites.
