This Website uses cookies to allow you to select a preferred location view and default home page view and to let you access recently visited links (such as products, services, and individual AIG Company pages) more easily. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. You will not be able to access a preferred location view, a customized default home page view or your recently visited links. In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address or any other contact information. Please note that certain aggregate information may be linked with personally identifiable information. Any such linked information will be treated as personally identifiable information for the purposes of this Policy as long as it is so linked.

<span class="Custom_Bold">What do AIG and the AIG Companies do with personally identifiable information collected on the Website?</span> We will use personally identifiable information provided by visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided, as described in this Policy, or as disclosed at the time the visitor information is collected. We use the information submitted via the AIG InfoExchange to respond to your inquiry. If your inquiry might appropriately be answered by a particular AIG Company, it may be forwarded to that company. That AIG Company will use the information to respond to your inquiry. Neither AIG nor any AIG Company will use the information submitted to the AIG InfoExchange for marketing purposes, nor share it with any third party for marketing purposes, unless you consent to this use. We also may use the information submitted to ask you follow-up questions about which products you have purchased or are considering purchasing, in order to improve our services and better understand your needs. AIG (and in the event information has been forwarded to an AIG Company, such AIG Company) may store the information you submit via the AIG InfoExchange for such period of time as may be necessary, in its discretion, to resolve your inquiry or as may be needed/helpful to AIG companies. We may also offer visitors the opportunity to receive special promotions. If a visitor elects to receive such offers by becoming a Member, we will use the information provided by that visitor to send those offers. We also may use personally identifiable information or IP addresses to provide you with customized the content on our Website or to provide you with information most relevant to you.
</p>
<p>
<span class="Custom_Bold">Can I “opt out” of receiving e-mail promotions from AIG Companies?</span> If you change your mind about receiving promotional e-mails or electronic newsletters, you may choose not to receive such communications from us by: (1) following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the specific e-mail from which you wish to opt-out or (2) sending an e-mail to <a title="Reply to AIG" href="mailto:reply@aig.com">reply@aig.com</a>, specifying the particular e-mails list(s) from which you wish to be removed. The AIG Company responsible for that promotion or list will honor your request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional e-mails from an AIG Company or list, the AIG Companies may still contact you to tell you important information about the Website or us.
</p>
<p>
<span class="Custom_Bold">Do AIG and the AIG Companies share personally identifiable information with other companies?</span> We will not intentionally share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated entities except: (1) as described in this Policy or as disclosed at the time your personally identifiable information is provided; or (2) with your consent.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to inquiries or requests from government or public authorities; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of AIG, the AIG Companies, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our <a href="/terms-of-use_20_19317.html">Terms of Use</a>. In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of AIG and the AIG Companies such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, AIG and the AIG Companies may, in their sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Website, including without limitation, personally identifiable information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.
</p>
<p>
<span class="Custom_Bold">What do AIG and the AIG Companies do with aggregate information collected on the Website?</span> Because aggregate information collected on the Website does not personally identify you, we may use aggregate information for any purpose, and share aggregate information with third parties for any purpose. We share the information gathered using cookies, Pixel Tags and other similar technologies with other AIG companies and with our third party vendor, WebSideStory. WebSideStory gives us reports of this aggregated data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information. For example, we use aggregate information collected on the Website to evaluate how the Website is being used. In addition, we may collect and analyze information about how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Website, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to and popular with visitors and enables us to provide visitors with a better and richer experience on the Website. For example, we may use certain aggregate information to improve the performance of our Website To learn more about WebSideStory's privacy standards and use of web beacons, please visit: <a title="WebSideStory" href="http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a> In addition, we may share statistical information derived from the information submitted via the AIG InfoExchange with third parties; however, such statistical information is not associated with any individual in a personally identifiable manner.
