<p>Protecting the privacy and security of personal information about our customers is important. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) tells you how Matrix Direct, Inc. (“Matrix Direct”)&nbsp;&nbsp; treats information collected on www.matrixdirect.com about our current and former customers.</p>
<h2><br>TRUSTe Certified Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Effective Date: 9/1/2011</p>
<p><a href="http://privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv/en/www.aigdirect.com/seal_m" title="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification" target="_blank"><img alt="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification" src="http://privacy-policy.truste.com/certified-seal/ctv/en/www.aigdirect.com/seal_m.png" style="border: none; float: left; padding: 5px 15px 10px 0;"></a> Matrix Direct, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.</p>
<p>If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us at (858) 309-3000 or by email at customerservice2@matrixdirect.com.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site and does not cover the collection and use of information obtained offline.</p>
<p>We do not sell or share information about our customers with anyone else other than in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information. Our employee access to information about our customers is limited to people who need access to do their jobs.</p>
<p>We get most of the information we need from customer applications and other forms. If a customer authorizes it, we may get information from others.</p>
<p>For example, when a person applies for life insurance we may ask for permission to get information from insurance support organizations such as the Medical Information Bureau and consumer reporting agencies. We may also obtain information as we process customer transactions. The information we collect through our Web site and offline  includes:</p>
<h3>CUSTOMER INFORMATION</h3>
<p>such as Name, Date of Birth, Telephone Number, Email Address, Social Security Number and Demographic Data.</p>
<h3>FINANCIAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>such as Credit History, Income, Assets, and Other Insurance Products.</p>
<h3>HEALTH INFORMATION</h3>
<p>such as Medical History and other factors affecting insurability.</p>
<p>We use the information for business purposes, such as</p>
<p>•    contacting you regarding the products or services in which you have expressed an interest.</p>
<p>•    processing applications and claims,</p>
<p>•    servicing your business, and</p>
<p>•    offering you other products and services.</p>
<p>We share the information with others who provide services to help us process or administer our business.</p>
<p>We may share information under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>•    with medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications</p>
<p>•    with service providers such as third parties who help us process claims or print our customer statements, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, and an employment company to assist us with our hiring. We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and keep it confidential, and will share the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service</p>
<p>•    when we have the customer's prior permission</p>
<p>•    when we are allowed or required by law to disclose it, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</p>
<p>•    when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or</p>
<p>•    if Matrix Direct is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,  you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information  We may share information with other companies to offer customers other financial products and financial services that may be of interest to them. However, you have the right to tell us that you do not want us to share any information with these companies.  This right is known as the right to “opt out.” You may opt out at any time by sending us a written request to the address below.  Even if you opt out we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.  We will not share information with anyone else unless  •    we have the customer’s permission, or</p>
<p>•    we are allowed or required by law to disclose it.</p>
<h2><br>How Can I Unsubscribe From Matrix Direct Communications?</h2>
<p>We will occasionally send you newsletters and information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. We will use your name and email address to send these emails to you.</p>
<p>You may unsubscribe or opt out of these communications at any time by sending us a written request or by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the email communications you receive. Even if you unsubscribe we may still disclose information as allowed or required by law.</p>
<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.  Generally, you may not unsubscribe from these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<h2><br>How Does Matrix Direct Keep My Social Security Number Safe?</h2>
<p>It is the policy of Matrix Direct to protect customer and employee Social Security Numbers that we collect in the course of our business as confidential. This includes maintaining physical and electronic security procedures to guard against unauthorized access to Social Security Numbers. We also limit access to Social Security Numbers, by among other means, only granting access to Social Security Numbers to our employees who use that information to perform their job-related duties. In addition, we do not disclose Social Security Numbers to third parties, except where required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from our site about children under the age of 13.

<h2><br>Will I Be Notified of Privacy Policy Changes?</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Web site. Access to those changes will be presented via a link on our homepage and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email or postal mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of receiving communication from Matrix Direct then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.</p>

<h2><br>How Is Information Used for Customer Reviews?</h2>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in reviews conducted via email. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
