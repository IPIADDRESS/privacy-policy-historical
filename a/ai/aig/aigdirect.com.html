<ul>
<li>with medical examiners who help us underwrite life insurance applications</li>
<li>with service providers such as third parties who help us process claims or print our customer statements, an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, and an employment company to assist us with our hiring. We require that our service providers limit their use of the information and keep it confidential, and will share the personal information you provide only as necessary for the third party to provide that service</li>
<li>when we have the customer's prior permission</li>
<li>when we are allowed or required by law to disclose it, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, or</li>
<li>if AIG Direct is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information We may share information with other companies to offer customers other financial products and financial services that may be of interest to them.

If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<h2>How Does AIG Direct Keep My Social Security Number Safe?</h2>
<p>It is the policy of AIG Direct to protect customer and employee Social Security Numbers that we collect in the course of our business as confidential.

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Web site.

We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email or postal mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of receiving communication from AIG Direct then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.</p>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
<h2>How Do Third Party Cookies and Action Tags Work?</h2>
<p>Our site uses a service that collects data remotely by using "web beacons" or tags embedded in our site's content. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, email address, or any other contact information. We share this information with affiliated companies and with our third party vendor, Adobe Site Catalyst. Adobe Site Catalyst gives us reports of this aggregated, anonymous data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information.

To opt out of retargeting advertisements by Fetchback, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer opt out page located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" title="Opt Out of Fetchback Retargeting Advertisements">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by our Privacy Privacy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we use third tracking partners to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<h2>How Is Information Used for Customer Reviews?</h2>
<p>We may provide you the opportunity to participate in reviews conducted via email. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these reviews is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
<p>We use this information to evaluate our level of customer service. With your consent we may post your reviews on our Web site along with your name. If you want your review removed please contact us at Client.Services@aigdirect.com.</p>
<p>We use a third party service provider to conduct these reviews; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a review with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
<h2>Is this Web Site Secure?</h2>
<p>This Web site takes precaution to protect our users' information. Access to users' information is restricted in our offices, and we follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an agent or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every year, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, send an email to Client.Services@aigdirect.com.</p>
<h2>Am I Protected When Linking to Other Sites?</h2>
<p>This Web site may from time to time contain links to other Web sites, banner ads or advertisements (which in turn may link to other locations) for the convenience of users in locating information and services that may be of interest. If you use these linked Web sites or advertisements, you may leave this site and go to Web sites that we do not control. If you decide to visit these Web sites or advertisers, you do so at your own risk and it is your responsibility to read and comply with the privacy policies on those Web sites.
