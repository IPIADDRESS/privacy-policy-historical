Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new products and services (“Products and Services”), including the addition of new properties shall be subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the General Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and Conditions”). By using AirPlay Direct you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>AirPlayDirect.com is a music-oriented content and information website that provides a service to musical artists and to record companies on behalf of musical artists (each an “Artist” and collectively “Artists”) to post information regarding themselves as well as musical content owned and/or created by them. </p>
<p>AirPlay Direct cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at office@AirPlayDirect.com.</p>
<p>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY AIRPLAY DIRECT<br>
AirPlay Direct collects User submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age to authenticate Users, and to send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the AirPlay Direct service, special events, contests and special offers. </p>
<p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, AirPlay Direct also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Artists and other visitors to the site. This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. AirPlay Direct will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>AirPlay Direct may also use a Users’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. AirPlay Direct may send email messages which use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the AirPlay Direct website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. AirPlay Direct tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.</p>
<p>From time to time, AirPlay Direct or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on AirPlay Direct. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. AirPlay Direct may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. </p>
<p>AirPlay Direct may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service. AirPlay Direct also collects information regarding customer activities on our website, and on related websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most interest to them.</p>
<p>USE OF COOKIES<br>

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.

<p>SECURITY<br>
AirPlay Direct User and Artist accounts are secured by User-created and Artist-created (as applicable) passwords. AirPlay Direct takes precautions to insure that account information is kept private. AirPlay Direct uses reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that AirPlay Direct cannot guarantee the security of Listener or Artist account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time.
