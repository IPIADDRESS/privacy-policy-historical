<h3>Customer Considerations</h3>
<p>Account Information. As a Customer of AirWatch, we only collect private information that you voluntarily provide us. In cases where necessary, AirWatch collects certain information that is necessary to fully service your AirWatch account. As a Customer, you may be asked to provide information that is needed in order to create your AirWatch account and fulfill our service commitment to you such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mails address. If you choose to register with us for a promotional event we will also collect your credit card information. We treat any personal information that you provide to us as highly confidential. AirWatch may use this personal information for editorial and feedback purposes, marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis and for product development. Your personal information, however, will never be sold to any company nor will it be shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise in this policy or as required by law. 
</p>
<p>Use of Account Information. In addition to other specific instances described herein, AirWatch may use information collected for the purposes that include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In instances where AirWatch and a partner jointly promote the AirWatch service, AirWatch may provide that partner certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing AirWatch and the partner to evaluate the promotion.</li>
<li>AirWatch may use your information to disclose summary information to strategic and business partners: the summary information is obtained by combining data from many individuals with the name and other identifiers removed.</li>
<li>AirWatch also may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This information may be used to negotiate with service providers who complement the AirWatch service or assist us in our efforts to expand our customer base.</li>
<li>AirWatch uses the information in order to provide services and may perform auditing, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services, ensure the technical functioning of our network, protect the rights or property of AirWatch or our users, and develop new products or services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than has provided above, AirWatch will not divulge any of your personal information—contact, or geographic location—to any other organization unless: (1) you give AirWatch explicit, and specific, prior permission; (2) we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf such as an employment partner to process job applications, a credit card processing company to bill you for events, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. (these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures); (3) we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable agreements, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AirWatch, its users or the public as required or permitted by law;&nbsp; (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry; and/or if AirWatch is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,&nbsp; you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
</p>
<p>Tracking and Location Information. AirWatch may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from your usage of the AirWatch Console such as usage patterns, travel patterns, and Web site page views, and traffic patterns. AirWatch may use this tracking and location information for statistical purposes to improve our products and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently. When you access the AirWatch Console, our servers automatically record information that your device sends and these server logs may include: the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your device; your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request; and other information regarding Internet connection activity (such as packets sent and received). This information enables AirWatch to accurately perform our billing functions, monitor and maintain our network, address issues that may arise concerning claims of abuse or inappropriate activity. Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to differentiate users on our network, and in some cases, we act as a pass-through for certain pieces of personal information in order to obtain authentication to allow for Internet access. Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to perform our support obligations.
</p>

<h3>Individual Considerations</h3>
<p>Monitoring  Information. The levels of communication and monitoring functionality between your mobile device or smartphone and the AirWatch Console is selected by our Customer who is typically your employer or the company for whom you work as an independent contractor or consultant. In some instances, our Customer asks us to host the AirWatch Console and in other instances our Customer hosts the AirWatch Console. When AirWatch hosts the AirWatch Console, we may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from your usage of the mobile device and may perform other functions. The information collected and tracked by the AirWatch Console depends upon the system configurations chosen by our Customer. While the following are not required, such information may include, where enabled by the Customer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device identifier and device username</li>
<li>Status of the mobile device SIM card</li>
<li>MAC addresses and device serial numbers</li>
<li>Phone number, signal strength, cell tower, carrier, IMEI#, and other WWAN attributes</li>
<li>First and last name and email address of device user</li>
<li>Data usage through WWAN interface (excluding content)</li>
<li>Transaction history regarding SMS, email and phone calls, excluding the content of messages and calls.</li> 
<li>Device check-out/check-in: tracking who uses which device as well as the physical status of the device at the start of a shift and then again at the end of a shift</li>
<li>Tracking of associated device assets, including service plan and associated physical equipment (i.e., cradles, etc.)</li>
<li>Tracking of applications loaded on the device (excluding content)</li>
<li>Real-time GPS location tracking and mapping, including analysis of location data and history</li>
<li>Mobile device remote control, including screen capture.</li>
</ul>

<p>The portions of the AirWatch software that allow smartphones and mobile devices to be monitored by the AirWatch Console run in the background of the devices. Individuals are notified that these functions may occur, but may not be aware when these functions are occurring in real time. This information is all made available to our Customer via the AirWatch Console for our Customer’s use in accordance with its own business uses. Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to perform our support obligations.</p>

<p>Use of Information. Other than as provided above, AirWatch will not divulge any of your personal information—contact, financial, bill history, or geographic location—to any other organization unless: (1) you give AirWatch explicit, and specific, prior permission; (2) we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf (these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures); (3) we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable license terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AirWatch, its users or the public as required or permitted by law; (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry; and/or (5) if AirWatch is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,&nbsp; you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>AirWatch has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the AirWatch Customer (the data controller). If the Customer requests AirWatch to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.</p>

<p>Data Retention. AirWatch will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed provide services to our Client. AirWatch will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h3>General Considerations Applicable to Customers and Individuals.</h3>
<p>Data Usage. When a device communicates with the AirWatch Console, it results in the transmission of data to and from the mobile device and such transmission of data could result in additional carrier or service provider charges to the Individual. AIRWATCH DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CARRIER OR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER DATA COSTS OR CHARGES INCURRED BY ANY CUSTOMER OR INDIVIDUAL IN CONNECTION WITH USAGE OF THE AIRWATCH PRODUCTS.</p>

<p>Email. When Customers or Individuals send email or other communications to AirWatch, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. To the extent that we have an email address for you, AirWatch may contact you or Web site visitors regarding account status and changes to this Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to Web site visitors. AirWatch opposes the e-mailing of any junk mail, and does not sell customer information to e-mail lists or telemarketers. If any of our partner sites engage in such practices, for any reason, AirWatch will immediately investigate, and if appropriate, discontinue services with such parties. If you receive junk e-mail that mentions AirWatch or its services, please send details to us at support@air-watch.com and we will investigate promptly.</p>

<p>Correcting and Updating Your Information. As an AirWatch Customer, you are always fully in control of the information that we maintain to service you. AirWatch Customers can change their personal information at any time and as often as necessary by logging into their account or contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@air-watch.com">support@air-watch.com</a>. AirWatch Customers also can request to “opt out” and have the data deleted (requests for deletion of certain information may require closing the account). Information about a Customer may be withheld or exempted from deletion if this is required by law, is part of a fraud investigation or is required for accounting and audit purposes. Information regarding individuals is ultimately controlled by the Customer by whom the Individual is employed or for whom the Individual serves as a consultant or contractor. Accordingly, any opportunity to change information or “opt out” is between the Customer and the Individual.</p>

<p>We will respond to all requests for access within 30 days.</p>

<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>Newsletters. If you are a Customer we will use your name and email address to send our newsletter to you. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the emails you receive.</p>
