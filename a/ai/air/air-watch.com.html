    <h1>AIRWATCH PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	</div>



    <div id="copy">
 	<div id="main">


<p>The software licensed by AirWatch, LLC (“AirWatch”) provides mobile device management and consists of two elements: (1) the AirWatch Console which allows communication and control functions with smartphones or mobile devices to be monitored and (2) a software agent or other method that facilitates communication with the AirWatch Console licensed by our customers.  The privacy considerations for customers who license the AirWatch software to perform enterprise-wide mobile device management (“Customers”) and the privacy considerations for those on whose mobile devices are being monitored (“Individuals”) are both discussed in this Policy.</p>
<p>
  Whether you are a Customer or an Individual, the privacy and security of your personal information is a foremost consideration of AirWatch, LLC (“AirWatch”).  We want to make sure you understand how the AirWatch software works and how we use any personal information gathered while allowing you to feel secure that your privacy interests are being respected within the bounds of this Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies to all of our software and services.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h3><u>Customer Considerations</u></h3>
  <p>	<b>Account Information.</b>  As a Customer of AirWatch, we only collect private information that you voluntarily provide us.  In cases where necessary, AirWatch collects certain information that is necessary to fully service your AirWatch account.  As a Customer, you may be asked to provide information that is needed in order to create your AirWatch account and fulfill our service commitment to you such as your name, address, phone number, e-mails address and billing information.  If you are paying for your access to our services using a credit card, we will collect appropriate information so that we may process a charge to your credit card; however, all credit card and bank information is encrypted.  We treat any personal information that you provide to us as highly confidential. AirWatch may use this personal information for editorial and feedback purposes, marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis and for product development.  Your personal information, however, will never be sold to any company nor will it be shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise in this policy or as required by law. In instances where AirWatch and a partner jointly promote the AirWatch service, AirWatch may provide that partner certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing AirWatch and the partner to evaluate the promotion.</p>
  <p>
  	<b>Use of Account Information.</b>  In addition to other specific instances described herein, AirWatch may use information collected for the purposes that include the following: </p>
  	<ul>
  <li>	In instances where AirWatch and a partner jointly promote the AirWatch service, AirWatch may provide that partner certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing AirWatch and the partner to evaluate the promotion.</li>
  <li>	AirWatch may use your information to disclose summary information to strategic and business partners: the summary information is obtained by combining data from many individuals with the name and other identifiers removed. </li>
  <li>	AirWatch also may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This information may be used to negotiate with service providers who complement the AirWatch service or assist us in our efforts to expand our customer base.</li>
  <li>	AirWatch uses the information in order to provide services and may perform auditing, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services, ensure the technical functioning of our network, protect the rights or property of AirWatch or our users, and develop new products or services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Other than has provided above, AirWatch will not divulge any of your personal information -- contact, financial, bill history, or geographic location -- to any other organization unless: (1) you give AirWatch explicit, and specific, prior permission; (2) we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf (these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures); (3) we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable agreements, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AirWatch, its users or the public as required or permitted by law; and/or (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry.</p>
  
  <p><b>Tracking and Location Information.</b>  AirWatch may collect and/or track certain information that is derived from your usage of the AirWatch Console such as usage patterns, travel patterns, and Web site page views, and traffic patterns and information about your geographic location.  AirWatch may use this tracking and location information for statistical purposes to improve our products and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently.  When you access the AirWatch Console, our servers automatically record information that your device sends and these server logs may include: the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your device; your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request; and other information regarding Internet connection activity (such as packets sent and received).  This information enables AirWatch to accurately perform our billing functions, monitor and maintain our network, address issues that may arise concerning claims of abuse or inappropriate activity.   Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to differentiate users on our network, and in some cases, we act as a pass-through for certain pieces of personal information in order to obtain authentication to allow for Internet access.  Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to perform our support obligations.</p>
  	<br><br>
  <h3>Individual Considerations</h3>
  <p>
  <b>Monitoring Information.</b>  The levels of communication and monitoring functionality between your mobile device or smartphone and the AirWatch Console is selected by our Customer who is typically your employer or the company for whom you work as an independent contractor or consultant.  In some instances, our Customer asks us to host the AirWatch Console and in other instances our Customer hosts the AirWatch Console.  When AirWatch hosts the AirWatch Console hosted by AirWatch we may collect and/or track some (but not necessarily all) information that is derived from your usage of the mobile device and may perform other functions such as:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p><ul>
  <li>	Status of the mobile device SIM card, which AirWatch tracks as a separate, specialized mobile asset </li>
  <li>	Phone number, signal strength, cell tower, carrier, IMEI#, and other WWAN attributes </li>
  <li>Data usage through WWAN interface </li>
  <li>SMS, email and phone history with detailed transaction information </li>
  <li>Device check-out/check-in:  tracking who uses which device as well as the physical status of the device at the start of a shift and then again at the end of a shift </li>
  <li>Tracking of associated device assets, including service plan, third-party software loaded on device and associated physical equipment (i.e., cradles, etc.) </li>
  <li>SMS and phone log audit trail and analysis </li>
  <li>Live, real-time GPS location tracking and mapping  </li>
  <li>Location racking using a ‘breadcrumb’ trail of the device position on a time and distance basis </li>
  <li>Tracking and analysis of location data to help ensure optimal mobile workforce performance </li>
 <li>	Rapid deployment and enforcement of pre-defined ‘Golden Image’ for mobile devices, including: device settings; OS updates; security settings (i.e., WPA / WEP); and third-party application versioning</li>
  <li>Comprehensive, flexible over-the-air (OTA) provisioning including: processes for creating mobile device update, including device settings; OS updates, registry settings, security settings (i.e., WPA / WEP) and third-party app versioning; forced immediate provisioning or via a pre-defined update schedule; monitoring of completion rates, identifying any errors and notification of help desk; and identification of mobile devices by software version loaded</li>
  <li>Mobile device remote control including: screen or video capture and library; macro playback for common configurations; remote management functions for the AirWatch Console; device reset, including soft, hard and factory reset; device messaging, forcing user acknowledgement; real-time file management and registry management; and device provisioning initiated by the AirWatch Console</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>
  The portions of the AirWatch software that allow smartphones and mobile devices to be  monitored by the AirWatch Console run in the background of the devices so that the Individual may not know that these functions are occurring.  This information is all made available to our Customer via the AirWatch Console for our Customer’s use in accordance with its own business uses.  AirWatch may also use this tracking and location information for statistical purposes to improve our products and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently. Some of the information AirWatch collects allows us to perform our support obligations.</p>
  
  <p><b>Use of Information.</b>
    Other than has provided above, AirWatch will not divulge any of your personal information -- contact, financial, bill history, or geographic location -- to any other organization unless: (1) you give AirWatch explicit, and specific, prior permission; (2) we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf (these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures); (3) we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable license terms, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AirWatch, its users or the public as required or permitted by law; and/or (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry.</p>
  <br><br>
  
  <h3>General Considerations Applicable to Customers and Individuals.</h3>
  
  <p><b>Data Usage.</b>  When a device communicates with the AirWatch Console, it results in the transmission of data to and from the mobile device and such transmission of data could result in additional carrier or service provider charges to the Individual.  AIRWATCH DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CARRIER OR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER DATA COSTS OR CHARGES INCURRED BY ANY CUSTOMER OR INDIVIDUAL IN CONNECTION WITH USAGE OF THE AIRWATCH PRODUCTS.</p>
  
  <p><b>Email.</b>  
  When Customers or Individuals send email or other communications to AirWatch, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. To the extent that we have an email address for you, AirWatch may contact you or Web site visitors regarding account status and changes to this Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to Web site visitors. AirWatch opposes the e-mailing of any junk mail, and does not sell customer information to e-mail lists or telemarketers. If any of our partner sites engage in such practices, for any reason, AirWatch will immediately investigate, and if appropriate, discontinue services with such parties. If you receive junk e-mail that mentions AirWatch or its services, please send details to us at support@air-watch.com and we will investigate promptly.</p>
  
  <p><b>Correcting and Updating Your Information.</b>
  
   As an AirWatch Customer, you are always fully in control of the information that we maintain to service you.  AirWatch Customers can change their personal information at any time and as often as necessary.  AirWatch Customers also can request to “opt out” and have the data deleted (requests for deletion of certain information may require closing the account).  Information about a Customer may be withheld or exempted from deletion if this is required by law, is part of a fraud investigation or is required for accounting and audit purposes.  Information regarding individuals is ultimately controlled by the Customer by whom the Individual is employed or for whom the Individual serves as a consultant or contractor.  Accordingly, any opportunity to change information or “opt out” is between the Customer and the Individual.</p>
    
  <p><b>Commitment to the Privacy of Your Family. </b> Protecting the safety of minor children when they use the Internet is very important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and other applicable laws. We recommend that children receive permission from a parent before gaining access to the AirWatch service or sending personal information to AirWatch or anyone else online.</p>
  <p><b>
  Other Sites.</b>  AirWatch does not control and will not be responsible for the collection of personal information by third party websites.  We have no responsibility or liability for the practices and policies implemented by third parties on their websites, accordingly, they are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should contact the owners of third party websites directly to ask questions about their privacy practices and policies.  </p>
 <p><b> Limitation of Liability.  </b>AIRWATCH SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY CUSTOMER OR INDIVIDUAL FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR DATA USE.  AIRWATCH’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS POLICY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO $10,000.00.</p>
 
 <p><b> Security Measures. </b> Your account information is kept confidential and secure via a unique username and password that is selected by you. Your username and password should be kept confidential because they are the key to accessing the information held by AirWatch about you.  You are responsible for keeping your username and password safe and confidential because they are the key to accessing the information held by AirWatch about you.  If your computer or other device is accessible to or by others, you should log out of the AirWatch services whenever you leave your computer or other device.  Please refer to our Security Notice for other information regarding security measures. </p>
 
 <p><b> Language.</b>  In the event that AirWatch has provided you with a translation of the English language version of this Privacy Policy, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only; that the English language version of the Privacy Policy governs your relationship with AirWatch; and, if there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Privacy Policy and the translation says, the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
 
 <p><b> Additional Information.</b>  AirWatch reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. By using the AirWatch software, you are acknowledging and accepting all terms and conditions outlined in this Privacy Policy and acknowledging that it may change from time to time.</p>
