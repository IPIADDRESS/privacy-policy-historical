<h1>AirlineRatings.com Privacy Policy </h1>
 
About this Privacy Policy <br><br>

This Privacy Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal 
information is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by AirlineRatings.com (AR) 
and its related companies including but not limited to Seven Network (Operations) Limited, 
Pacific Magazines Pty Limited ("Pacific") and West Australian Newspapers Limited ("WAN"). The Policy 
relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology.The Policy relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology and assumes that you are an Australian resident.<br><br>

By using the AR websites, products or services, you consent to the Group using your personal 
information as set out in this Privacy Policy. <br><br>

AR treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, the Group has 
systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal 
information. <br><br>

AR abides by the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs"), which provide a scheme in relation to 
the collection, disclosure, use and storage of personal information. AR's objective is to handle 
information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is 
handled. <br><br>

The Privacy Act provides for exemptions: <br><br>

a. in relation to employee records (being records relating to a current or former employment 
relationship between AR and the individual); and <br><br>

b. from coverage in relation to the journalism activities of AR (as explained further at 
section 3). <br><br>


1. Collection of Personal Information <br><br>


Personal information is information or opinion about an individual, or an individual who is reasonably 
identifiable (whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is 
recorded in a material form). The nature of personal information collected by AR generally 
comprises an individual's name, address, phone number, fax, e-mail address, birth date and gender, as 
well as interests and information about your transactions with us and with some of our business 
partners. <br><br>

The primary purpose for collecting such information is to arrange, conduct and promote AR's 
media activities (including but not limited to production, broadcasting and publishing) and provide you 
with requested products and services. <br><br>

AR may collect personal information from you in a number of ways. These include, but are not 
limited to situations in which you set up an account with a company within AR (for example a 
magazine or newspaper subscription), request to receive products or services from AR, provide 
products or services to AR, enter a competition or voting forum, utilise AR's services 
(including, but not limited to IPTV services, websites, mobile phone apps, blogs and online forums), 
complete a survey or questionnaire, or when you communicate with AR by telephone, fax, 
writing, email, or any other electronic means. <br><br>

When you are using a service we provide to you over the internet (for example a website, mobile phone 
app or digital edition of one of AR's publications), we may use technologies to collect information 
as to your activities on such services associated with AR including your IP Address and/or the 
type of operating system you use and/or the domain name of your Internet Service Provider, software 
and hardware attributes and the web-page you request. In addition, AR may set and access their 
cookies and other similar technologies (not constituting personal information) on your computer or other 
internet-enabled device and may let other companies (such as third party advertisers) set and access 
their cookies on your computer (subject to their own policies). The use of cookies helps us to recognise 
you, improve and personalise your experience of our products and services, measure your use of our 
products and services and show you relevant advertising. If you do not wish for information to be 
collected through the use of cookies, you can disable, remove or block the use of cookies in your 
internet browser. <br><br>

Whilst AR will attempt to ensure all transfer of data to a third party and use by a third party is 
secure, the Group cannot be held responsible for the theft of data by a third party, or the consequences 
resulting from the loss of data where that loss is associated with the technical malfunction, tampering by 
a third party, viruses, computer bugs, or any action or event beyond the reasonable control of AR.<br><br>

AR also collects other types of personal information from time to time (e.g. credit information 
and drivers licence details), and will inform you upon collecting such information the purpose for which it 
is being collected. <br><br>

AR does not collect personal information unless it is reasonably necessary for AR to perform 
one or more of its functions and activities or supply one or more of its services. On occasion, some of 
this personal information may be sensitive and the Group will only collect it with your consent or when 
required or authorised to by law. <br><br>

AR or its agents will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, AR may collect personal information when you subscribe to one of the Group's publications, complete 
a survey, become a member, attend a function or event, enter a competition, make a purchase, provide 
a resume or enter an agreement. <br><br>

There may be other occasions when AR needs to source personal information from third parties 
such as credit agencies and recruitment agencies. If we do this, we will use reasonable efforts to notify 
you afterwards. <br><br>

You may choose to deal with AR anonymously or under a pseudonym where lawful and 
practicable (i.e. provided we are still able to provide the relevant service or do business with you without 
that information). For example, it might not be practical to deal with you anonymously if we need to 
process a payment, delivery goods or services or send personalised communications to you. <br><br>

2. Use &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information <br><br>


Personal information provided to the Group may be shared with related companies within AR. AR takes all reasonably practical steps to keep such information strictly confidential. <br><br>

AR may use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which it was initially 
collected, namely to arrange, conduct and promote AR's media activities (including but not 
limited to production, broadcasting and publishing) and provide you with requested products and 
services (and renewals thereof), as well as all purposes necessary and incidental to the provision of 
goods or services by AR or by anyone on behalf of AR. <br><br>

In addition, AR may use and disclose your personal information for purposes related to the initial 
purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related 
purposes include analysing your personal information for the purpose of identifying and referring you to 
products and services and/or production and broadcast activities and/or media activities that may be of 
benefit or interest to you, displaying targeted advertising based on those interests, improving our 
services, conducting research, contacting you, internal auditing and administration, adding your name to 
a guest list or invitation list, or assisting AR to carry out auditing, administration, or product 
enhancement. Without limiting the foregoing, your personal information may be used to create an 
anonymous link to additional third party data (for example the data of our business partners) for the 
purpose of tailoring information you may be more interested in, and that link may be placed in cookies 
for the purpose of the Group and its business partners sending you targeted advertising when you use 
websites or other services over the internet, including those supplied to you by the Group as well as by 
third parties unaffiliated with AR. <br><br>

Additionally, in the event of a re-organization, merger or sale, AR may transfer any and all 
personal information we have collected from you to the relevant third party. AR may also be 
required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is: <br><br>

a. required or authorised by law; <br><br>
b. required in order to investigate an unlawful activity; <br><br>
c. required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or <br><br>
d. necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health or safety, or to 
public health or safety. <br><br>



Generally, AR will retain your personal information within Australia and not use or disclose it 
overseas. However, on some occasions the information may need to be transferred to overseas 
countries including but not limited to the UK and the US in order to perform one of AR's functions 
or activities. In these circumstances, AR will either obtain your express or implied consent or will 
use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the foreign entity to which your personal information is 
transferred has appropriate measures in place to protect your personal information. <br><br>

Like most business organisations, AR performs some of its functions under licence and also 
contracts out some functions and relies on third party suppliers to conduct specialised activities such as 
website management, share registry services, mail out services, call centre services, data analysis and 
processing services, insurance broking, vehicle and petrol supply, supply of equipment, engineering 
services, security services, financial services, credit reporting services and travel and hospitality 
services. <br><br>

Whilst personal information may be provided to these licensors and suppliers in order to enable them to 
perform the agreed tasks, the Group will make every effort to ensure that the supplier handles the 
personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles and confidentiality principles. 
AR will require all such suppliers to provide privacy undertakings and enter confidentiality 
agreements. <br><br>

Some companies that AR is affiliated with have their own privacy policies. For example, many of 
the Group's websites are hosted by Yahoo!7 which is a joint venture in which the Group has a 50% 
interest. In some circumstances, Yahoo!7 collects personal information from you on our behalf, in which 
case it will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In other circumstances, Yahoo!7 will 
collect personal information from you for its own business, in which case your personal information will 
be handled in accordance with Yahoo!7's Privacy Policy.<br><br>


3. Collection, Use and Disclosure of records collected in the course of journalism <br><br>


As a media organization involved in the collection, preparation and dissemination of news, current affairs 
and information, the journalistic activities and practices of AR are exempt from the APPs, 
however AR is committed to observing standards in relation to privacy in the context of its 
journalism activities as set out in the following: <br><br>

a. the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, which applies to the Group's television 
broadcasting activities; and <br><br>
b. Seven West Media's Print and Print (Online) Privacy Policy, which applies to WAN's and Pacific's 
print and online journalism activities (in addition to this Privacy Policy applying generally to 
WAN's and Pacific's handling of personal information outside of their journalism activities). <br><br>


4. Direct marketing <br><br>


From time to time AR may use your personal information to identify programs, products and 
services that may be of interest to you. The Group may use your personal information to send you 
information regarding AR's programs, products and services, and those available through the 
Group's business partners. <br><br>

From time to time, AR may also provide your personal information to carefully selected third 
parties for the purpose of them providing you with information regarding products and services specific 
to your needs, and to help AR conduct product enhancement activities. <br><br>

If you do not wish to receive direct marketing information from the Group or third parties (as applicable) 
as outlined in this section, please let AR know by using the unsubscribe function in the 
communication you receive, or alternatively by contacting support@airlineratings.com AR will take immediate steps to ensure that you 
do not receive any such direct marketing information in future. <br><br>

5. Personal Information Quality <br><br>


AR's objective is to ensure that all personal information collected by AR is accurate, 
complete and up-to-date. To assist AR in achieving its objective, please contact the Privacy 
Officer if any of your details change. Further, if you believe that the information AR holds is not 
accurate, complete or up-to-date, please contact the Privacy Officer on support@airlineratings.com in order to have the information corrected. <br><br>


6. Personal Information Security<br><br> 

AR is committed to keeping your personal information secure, and we will take reasonable 
precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, loss, release, misuse or 
alteration. <br><br>

Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents, but is generally stored electronically 
on AR's software or systems. <br><br>

AR maintains physical security over its paper and electronic data stores, such as locks and 
security systems. The Group also uses computer and network security technologies such as firewalls, 
intrusion prevention software, antivirus software, external email filtering and passwords to control and 
restrict access to authorised staff for approved purposes and to secure personal information from 
unauthorised access, modification, disclosure, misuse and loss. <br><br>

Whilst AR takes all reasonable steps to secure your personal information from loss, misuse and 
unauthorised access, you acknowledge that all activities in which you intentionally or unintentionally 
supply information to the Group carries an inherent risk of loss of, misuse of, or unauthorised access to 
such information. The Group cannot be held responsible for such actions where the security of the 
personal information is not within the control of AR, or where AR cannot reasonably 
prevent such incident. <br><br>

Additionally, you acknowledge that the collection and use of your personal information by third parties 
may be subject to separate privacy policies and/or the laws of other jurisdictions. <br><br>

7. Access To Personal Information <br><br>


You may request access to the personal information AR holds about you. <br><br>

The procedure for gaining access is as follows: <br><br>

a. All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to 
the Privacy Officer. <br><br>
b. You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or 
person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will 
allow AR to process your request faster. <br><br>
c. AR will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually be granted 
within 14 days, or if it is more complicated, 30 days. AR will inform you if this timeframe 
is not achievable. <br><br>
d. You will be asked to verify your identity. <br><br>
e. A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time 
consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and 
reproduction costs. <br><br>
f. Depending on the circumstances, you may be forwarded the information by mail or email, or you 
may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place. <br><br>
g. You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information that is no longer accurate.<br><br> 




In some circumstances, AR may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances 
include the following: <br><br>

a. access would create a serious threat to safety; <br><br>
b. providing access will have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;<br><br> 
c. denying access is required or authorised by law; <br><br>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>2.7. Consent</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>2.7.1.</strong> You consent to AR using your personal information as set out above in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Standards in the course of journalism</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.1. This policy applies in the following circumstances</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.1.1.</strong> Publication of person's personal information concerning a person's personal or private affairs;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.1.2.</strong> Publication of information which interferes with a person's private seclusion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.2. Identifiable person</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.2.1.</strong> For this policy to be breached, a particular person must be identifiable from the publication. That person can be a private individual or a public figure.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.2.2.</strong> A person is identifiable if, from the publication, the person's identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.3. Personal information</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.3.1.</strong> Personal information can include facts about a person's health, personal relationships, financial affairs, sexual activities, and sexual preferences or practices. It can also include information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, criminal record and other sensitive personal matters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.3.2.</strong> This information need not be secret or confidential in order to be private.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.4. Seclusion</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.4.1.</strong> A person's seclusion may be intruded upon where</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.4.1.1.</strong> He or she would have a reasonable expectation that his or her activities would not be observed or overheard by others; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.4.1.2.</strong> A person of ordinary sensibilities would consider the publication of these activities to be highly offensive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.4.2.</strong> Depending on the circumstances, this may include everyday activities and it will usually include sexual activities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.4.3.</strong> The invasion must be more than fleeting. It is possible for this to occur in a public space.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.5. Consent</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.1.</strong> If consent is obtained prior to the publication of material, then the person waives his or her claim to privacy protection.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.2.</strong> Consent can be express, such as when obtained in writing. It can also be implied; for example, where a person is a willing participant in an interview.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.3.</strong> If a person has actively drawn attention to material that would usually be considered private, this may be taken as consent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.4.</strong> There will be no waiver if consent is obtained by deception.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.5.</strong> Consent to the publication of private information or material that would breach privacy may be withdrawn before it is first published, if in all the circumstances it is reasonable to do so.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.6.</strong> The use of material that has been surreptitiously obtained will be an indicator that the person has not (at least at the time the material was obtained) consented to the publication. Consent to the use of such material can be given after the material has been obtained but before publication.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.5.7.</strong> The absence of an objection will not automatically be taken to be consent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.6. Children and vulnerable people</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.6.1.</strong> Special care must be taken in the use of material concerning a child (a person of 16 years or under) or a vulnerable person. A person's vulnerability may be intrinsic (for example, where a person has a mental illness or difficulty communicating in English) or it may be situational (for example, where a person is bereaved or has been involved in a distressing event. Images of dead or seriously wounded people which may seriously distress or seriously offend a substantial number of readers should be displayed only when there is an identifiable public interest reason for doing so. Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that murder or accident victims are not identified directly or, where practicable, indirectly before their immediate families are notified by the authorities. Reports of suicide or attempted suicide should only be published where there is an identifiable public interest reason to do so and should exclude any detailed description of the method used. Such reports must be straightforward and must not include graphic details or images, or glamorise suicide in anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.6.2.</strong> A parent or guardian's express consent should be obtained before using material that invades a child's privacy. However, parental consent alone will not always be sufficient for a publisher to comply with its privacy obligations. Extra care must be taken before naming or visually identifying a child in matters concerning the child's health, welfare or personal information, or where the child or his or her immediate family is involved in criminal matters or court proceedings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.6.3.</strong> Even where consent is obtained, there may be circumstances where a person of ordinary sensibilities would consider the use of material that invades a child's or vulnerable person's privacy to be highly offensive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.7. Public figures</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.7.1</strong>. Public figures such as politicians, celebrities, prominent sports and business people and those in public office do not forfeit their right to privacy in their personal lives. However, it is accepted that public figures will be open to a greater level or scrutiny of any matter that may affect the conduct of their public activities and duties.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.8. Material in the public domain</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.8.1.</strong> Using material that is already in the public domain will generally not be an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.8.2.</strong> This includes the use of material obtained from online social media sites, unless access restrictions have been breached. However, the absence of access restrictions, while an important consideration, will not be determinative. Account will be taken of the nature of the material and the context in which it has been published.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.8.3.</strong> Using material that has previously been disclosed by a person on the confidential basis, or to a limited or closed circle of recipients, may be an invasion of his or her privacy. Its private nature may be implied even if there was no express request to keep it confidential.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.8.4.</strong> Using material that is already in the public domain will generally not be an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.9. Public Interest</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.1.</strong> The publication of private information or material that invades privacy, without consent, will not breach this policy if there is a clear and identifiable public interest in the material being published. The public interest is assessed at the time of the publication.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.2.</strong> Whether something is in the public interest will depend on all the circumstances, including whether a matter is capable of affecting the community at large so that citizens might be legitimately interested in or concerned about what is going on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.3.</strong> Public interest issues include public health and security; criminal activities; corruption; misleading the public; serious anti-social behaviour; politics; government and public administration; elections; and conduct of corporations, businesses, trade unions and religious organisations.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.4.</strong> Not all matters that interest the public are in the public interest.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.5.</strong> Any material that invades a person's privacy in the public interest must directly or indirectly contribute to the public's capacity to assess an issue of importance to the public, and its knowledge and understanding of the overall subject. It should be proportionate and relevant to those issues, and not disclose peripheral facts or be excessively prolonged, detailed or salacious.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.9.6.</strong> In the case of public figures, the publication of material that invades the person's privacy may be in the public interest if it raises or answers questions about any of the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.9.6.1.</strong> The person's appointment to or resignation from public office</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.9.6.2.</strong> The person's fitness for office</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.9.6.3.</strong> The person's capacity to carry out his or her duties</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.9.6.4.</strong> Conduct or behaviour that contradicts the person's stated position on an issue.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.9.7.</strong> However, it is unlikely to be in the public interest if it is merely distasteful, socially damaging or embarrassing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>3.10. Breach of this policy</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.10.1.</strong> In order for there to be a breach of this section of this Privacy Policy there will need to be</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.10.1.1.</strong> Identification of a person from published material;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.10.1.2.</strong> The publication must disclose personal information or intrude upon the person's seclusion in more than a fleeting way.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px;"><strong>3.10.2.</strong> If the matters in 10.1 are satisfied there must also be</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.10.2.1.</strong> No consent to publication from the person, or that person's parent or guardian;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.10.2.2.</strong> The material published must not have been readily obtainable from the public domain;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px;"><strong>3.10.2.3.</strong> No public interest in the invasion of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>4.1.</strong> AR may edit this policy from time to time. We will publish these changes in this policy, as soon as they are made.</p>
