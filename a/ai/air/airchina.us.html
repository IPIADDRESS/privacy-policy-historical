In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, Air China may use these data for administrative and analytical purposes such as accounting, billing and audits, marketing, credit card processing and verification, customer-relations correspondence, and/or operation of the PhoenixMiles program and information systems management in relation to the aforementioned.</p>

We will not use any data regarding your surfing behaviour for marketing purposes (except on an anonymous basis) without first obtaining your explicit consent.</p>

	<p>Please indicate you consent to your data being used as described in this section “How Your Information Will Be Used” by ticking the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data.</p>

	<hr align="center" width="90%">

	<p><strong>Where We Store Your Data</strong><br>


</p><p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United States, the European Economic Area ("EEA") and other jurisdictions that regulate transborder transfers of personal data, which may not have well developed data protection legislation in comparison with the law of those jurisdictions. It may also be processed by staff operating outside those jurisdictions who work for any company within the Air China group or for one of our third party suppliers. These staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your booking, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. The purposes of the processing of your data are as set out in the first paragraph of “How Your Information Will Be Used”. Those processing the data include service providers working with Air China providing internet booking engine services, computer reservation system services, online payment management services, and email services. Air China will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>By providing your data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of your personal data as described herein.</p>
<p>The destinations outside the United States, EEA and other jurisdictions that regulate transborder transfers of personal data referred to in the preceding paragraphs include the People’s Republic of China.</p>

	Air China uses links to other Internet sites to improve your experience of our website. We will always seek to make these links clear by opening them in a new window of your web browser. However, please be aware that these websites may be owned and run by other companies and organizations. Air China does not endorse any such websites and we are not responsible for the information, material, products or services contained on or accessible through those websites. Your access and use of such websites remains solely at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for any information you divulge to a linked website.</p>

You have the right to ask us not to process your data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by informing us through the opt-out boxes on the forms we use to collect your data or at any time thereafter by e-mailing <a href="mailto:Privacy@airchina.com">Privacy@airchina.com</a>.</p>
	<p>For the avoidance of doubt, you may at any time object to our use of your data by sending an email to <a href="mailto:Privacy@airchina.com">Privacy@airchina.com</a>.</p>

	<hr align="center" width="90%">


	<p><strong>Cookies And Web Beacons</strong><br>
	A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website - session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other major websites that use cookies. To find out more information about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
	<p>Web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way certain simple information can also be gathered, such as: the IP address of your computer; time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the existence of cookies previously set by that server. This is information that is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not give any "extra" information away. They are simply a convenient way of gathering the simplest of statistics and managing cookies.</p>

	<hr align="center" width="90%">

	<p><strong>API (Advance Passenger Information)</strong><br>
	A growing number of destination countries oblige the airlines that fly to them to transmit passenger data before an aircraft lands in one of them. Usually, these legal regulations encompass the transmission of data on the passengers' identity and travel documents (passport, visa).</p>
	<p>As a rule, an airline does not have these data, so it must collect them shortly before an aircraft departs, which increasingly is being done by means of the so-called 'machine-readable zone' in the new travel documents. If we are requested to transmit your passenger data to foreign authorities other than the United States or Canada, we will obtain your consent before doing so.</p>
	<p>Collection of the data is done solely for immediate transmission to the authorities of the destination country.</p>

	<hr align="center" width="90%">

	<p><strong>Data Security</strong><br>
	Air China takes your data security very seriously. In addition to complying with all applicable data security regulations, to ensure the highest possible security for the transmission of your data between your web browser and our internet system we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypting technology. SSL is an industry standard way to send personal information over the Internet. It enables an encrypted communication respectively transfer of documents via the internet between web browser and web server. The URL of a website with SSL connection to your browser starts with https://. SSL is fast, secure, and it ensures that your personal information will not be read by anyone else.</p>


	<p>Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. "Perfect security," does not exist on the Internet and under certain circumstances, unauthorized parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
	<p>If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this web site. We may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@airchina.com">Privacy@airchina.com</a>.</p>
