<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Privacy Policy</span></strong>
<br>
Airpush makes this Website (the "Site") available to registered members of the Site ("Members"), subject to this privacy policy (the "Policy") and the Airpush Terms and Conditions ("User Agreement").  This Policy explains what information Airpush collects about Members on the Site, how Airpush uses and maintains the information. By becoming a Member of Airpush and using the Site and Services, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that some of your membership information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not use this Site or Services, nor become a Member.  If you are a Member and do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you must immediately terminate your account.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Personal Information You Provide to us</span></strong>
<br>
Airpush collects personally identifiable information ("PII") from Members that is volunteered by Members during the registration process or in response to specific information requests. Airpush also collects PII which third parties provide to Airpush in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Examples of PII that may be requested and/or collected include: your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, and password for your account. We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your account. When you purchase any Materials or Services from the Airpush Site, we may collect your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (however we do not retain your credit card number unless requested) and federal tax identification number. When you give us feedback, we may collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we collect your e-mail address, fax number, or mailing address, and any information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us. From time to time, Airpush may also present opportunities for Members to voluntarily provide a limited amount of general demographic information about themselves, which may include their gender, birth date, marital status, education, occupation, and household income.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Personal Information Collected via Technology</span></strong>
<br>
As you use the Airpush Site or any Airpush Service, some information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, access time, mobile phone number, mobile phone model, and telecom carrier. We may also store a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer or phone to store certain information about your use of the Airpush Site or Airpush Services. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or phone until you delete them).
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Personal Information from Other Sources</span></strong>
<br>
We may receive PII about you from other sources, including other users. We may associate this information with the other PII we have collected about you.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Use of Information</span></strong><br>
We use your PII to provide the Airpush Services to you, to respond to requests that you make, to personalize your online experience on the Airpush Site, to improve the Airpush Site and Airpush Services, and to better tailor the features, performance, and support of the Airpush Services.  We track IP protocol addresses solely in conjunction with session Cookies. We use persistent Cookies to keep track of your login name and password for Airpush Services and to personalize your online experience on the Airpush Site. Most web browsers accept Cookies by default, but allow users to reject Cookies by changing the browser preferences. If you have set up your browser to reject Cookies, some aspects of the Airpush Site and Airpush Services may not work properly.
We may use your PII to send you electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, unless you have requested not to receive such promotional communications from us. We may also use your PII to send you Airpush Services-related communications, and you may opt out of these communications if you terminate your account.  We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information at our discretion. “Anonymous Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your PII.  Any feedback you provide will be governed by the User Agreement.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Third Party Services</span></strong><br>
Certain activities, information and services available to Members are provided by entities not affiliated with Airpush. For example, if you choose to purchase a product or service from the site, the information you provide in connection with such purchase may be made available to a third party to satisfy that purpose. Although Airpush advises all of its partners to support this Policy, Airpush has no control over their information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure of such partners to adhere to this Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Third Party Cookies</span></strong><br>
In the course of serving advertisements, third-party advertisers or ad servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or phone. The use of cookies by such third party advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to their own respective privacy policies.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Links from the Site</span></strong><br>
Airpush provides links to many of Airpush's advertiser and partner Web sites. If you link to any of these third party Web sites, this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. Airpush shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites.
International Law. Should any law present in the nation where you reside or conduct business be such that any product, service, or activity conducted by, on, or via our site is banned, regulated, controlled or illegal then you are asked not to participate in any service, product or activity offered by, on or via this site.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Disclosure of Personal Information</span></strong><br>
Airpush may provide your PII to specified third parties for sending you promotional e-mails relating to such third parties’ products, unless you have requested us not to receive promotional communications from such third parties. Airpush may provide your PII to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide the Airpush Site and Airpush Services. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information (except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant).
Airpush may provide your credit card and related billing and payment information to third party service providers engaged on Airpush’s behalf, including payment processors and/or credit agencies, for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment, and servicing your accounts.
Airpush may share some or all of your PII with our Affiliates in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
If Airpush or our assets related to this Privacy Policy are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Law Enforcement Compliance</span></strong><br>
Airpush may be required by law, or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, to record some or all of your communications on or through the Airpush Site or Airpush Services. We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including your account information) and your communications through the Airpush Site and Airpush Services, if required by law or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (2) to protect and defend ours, our Affiliates,’ other users,’ or your, rights, property or safety.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</span></strong><br>
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your PII. When you receive promotional communications from us or the Airpush Site, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional e-mail you receive.
Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative e-mails regarding the Airpush Service, including, for example, purchase confirmation, account creation confirmation, and notices of material changes to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
You may change your email address and password for the Service by editing it in your account page. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request, only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note Concerning Users Under 18 Years of Age</span></strong><br>
Unless otherwise noted, the Site, the Airpush e-mails, advertisements and the content available in connection therewith, are neither intended for, nor directed to, persons under the age of 14. Except as otherwise noted, if Airpush learns that a person who registers on the Site is under the age of 14, Airpush will promptly terminate that individual's membership.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Children's Privacy</span></strong><br>
This Site is not open to children. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Security</span></strong><br>
While Airpush takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between Airpush and Members and/or users of the Site and our Materials, Airpush may be unable to prevent unauthorized access by third parties or inadvertent disclosure. Members and users acknowledge this risk when communicating with Airpush.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Consent to Processing</span></strong><br>
By providing PII and other information to Airpush, Members and users of the Site fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information in, and the transfer of such information to, the United States and other countries or territories, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Transfer in Certain Circumstances</strong></span><br>
In its sole discretion, Airpush may transfer, sell or assign information collected on or about Members and/or users of the Site, including without limitation, PII and other Member provided information, to one or more third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Airpush
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Terminate Account</strong></span><br>
Members of the Site who disagree with any provision of this Policy must immediately terminate their account with Airpush Accounts may be terminated by emailing support@airpush.com. All inquiries concerning the use of Member PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party, and not to Airpush
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Changes to this Policy</span></strong><br>
Airpush may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or part, in its sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy on the Site. Depending on the nature of the change, Airpush may announce the change (1) on the home page of the Site, or (2) provide such notice via e-mail to Members. By continuing to use the Site following any changes or by remaining a Member, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.
