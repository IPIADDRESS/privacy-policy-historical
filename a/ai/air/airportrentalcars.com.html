Certain services which you may access on the Site are provided by our third party partners, and protection of your information relating to such services will be governed by the privacy policy of such third party (see "Sharing Your Personal Data-Certain Services," below). By visiting the Site, you are accepting the Privacy Policy described herein.</p>

					<h4>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
					<p>We value your trust in us and will work hard to earn your confidence so that you can enthusiastically use our services and recommend us to your friends and family.</p>

					<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
					<p>We collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") about you that you specifically and voluntarily provide to us while using the Site. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card number or e-mail address.</p>

					<h4>Protecting Your Personal Data</h4>
					<p>The Personal Data you provide us is saved in a secure environment and is kept in our records to make it easier for you to use our services on return visits.</p>

					<p>Information collected by Lowestfare.com is stored in a single, secure database, accessible only by Lowestfare.com and its parent corporation, priceline.com.</p>

					<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we will employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies. Lowestfare.com has created a secure environment for credit card transactions. Lowestfare.com currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt all your personal information including credit card number, name and address to prevent your information from being read during transmission over the Internet.</p>

					<h4>How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>

If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by replying to Lowestfare.com using the hyperlink provided in these notices.</p>

					<h4>Sharing Your Personal Data</h4>
					<p>Lowestfare.com does not sell or rent your Personal Data to anyone. Lowestfare.com may share your Personal Data with priceline.com (its parent corporation), its subsidiaries, and as described below:</p>

					<p><strong>Certain Services:</strong> In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with one of our third party partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party partner. Below is a list of such services:</p>

					<p><strong>Priceline.com.</strong> This Privacy Policy applies to transactions made on the Lowestfare.com website. Products purchased through the priceline.com website are offered by priceline.com, and the privacy policy of priceline.com governs such transactions.

Priceline.com's contract with NLG requires NLG to maintain such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<p>We may revise this list from time to time if we decide to offer additional services through these or other third-party partners.</p>

					<p><strong>Lowestfare.com's Agents:</strong> Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, Lowestfare.com hires companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail) analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Also, Lowestfare.com requires all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect your Personal Data.</p>

					<p><strong>External Service Providers</strong>: When you use Lowestfare.com to purchase an airline ticket, reserve a hotel room or to take advantage of any of our other products and services (including travel insurance), we provide Personal Data to the airline, hotel, car rental agency, travel agency or other involved third-party.</p>

This material is sent by Lowestfare.com, and we do not give that other business your name or address. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please contact us and we will not send you any of this material.</p>

					<p><strong>Future Business Transfers:</strong> Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, Lowestfare.com may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that Lowestfare.com, or substantially all of its assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction.</p>

					<p><strong>Compliance with Law and Protection of Lowestfare.com:</strong> Lowestfare.com reserves the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with the law. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, or protect the rights, property or safety of Lowestfare.com, priceline.com, our users or others.</p>

					<p><strong>Consent:</strong> If none of the categories described above apply, we will notify you to obtain your consent if we believe it is necessary and appropriate to share your Personal Data with someone else. You will have the right to tell us not to share your Personal Data.</p>

					<h4>Our Policy Concerning Cookies</h4>
					<p>To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology.

The company may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites, in combination with non-personally identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we share web site usage information about visitors to our sites with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our site and other sites. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer. If you would like more information about the information collection practices of this third-party advertising company and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company, click here.
