<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p>Air Matters Network Pty Ltd ("Air Matters", our, us or we) operates the app <strong>Air Matters</strong> and the website <strong>http://air-matters.com</strong>. This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, use and disclose personal information in relation to the Services, which you consent to by accessing the Services. “Personal information” means information about an identifiable individual but does not include business information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or modified by consents you provide to Air Matters, and by agreements you enter into with Air Matters' services from time to time. To learn more about how we and third parties may process personal information for interest based advertising, and to opt out of such uses, please read below.</p>

<p><strong>What information is collected</strong></p>

<p>Air Matters wants to make your experiences with us satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose how much personal information to provide to us, and to control how we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy. Air Matters collects and uses information primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. If you choose to register with us, you may be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address. Customers who personalize our service come back more often - and it's the customers that visit us often who make us successful - so we do everything we can to make Air Matters your service and to give you just the content you want.</p>

<p>Information collected online is often defined as being either personally identifiable or anonymous:</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong> refers to information that identifies specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to judiciously provide Information to Air Matters so that we may provide more valuable free content and products to you.</p>

<p>The amount of Personal Information that you choose to disclose to Air Matters is completely up to you. The only way we know something about you personally is if you register for a personalized service or send us feedback via e-mail. In other words, we will know Personal Information about you only if you choose to share this type of information with us.</p>

<p><strong>Anonymous Information</strong> refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual, we do not know your names, where your live, or your date of birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information. Some of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the data we collect is similarly anonymous information. Anonymous Information may be collected several ways, including through the use of cookies, web beacons or from the device that you are using.</p>

<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>

<p>We may require you to register in order to access certain features within the Services by providing us with a valid email address and certain basic demographic information such as age and gender. All such information will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will provide you with a key or other authentication allowing you to log-in to access the designated features.  If you elect to store authentication information, such as a username and password, where others may access it, we are not responsible for any loss of personal data or other consequences if someone other than you uses that information to access our services. If you lose a device, such as a laptop, desktop, or smartphone, or a device is stolen containing your username and password, it is up to you to take all the steps necessary to protect yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing and Deleting Your Information</strong></p>

<p>Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. We will respond to your access request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>You have the right to delete your personal data from our server by delete your account in Settings or by contacting us, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.</p>

<p><strong>Our Policy Regarding Children</strong></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or direct or target interest based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services.  If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.  If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us.</p>
