<div class="accordion-content">
<p>If you choose not to provide us with the personal information that we request then we may not be able to offer our services and products to you. For example, we may not be able to complete a transaction or booking request or meet your special needs request.

We may not be able to provide you with Airpoints and/or Koru member benefits or complete your Airpoints transactions.</p>
<p>If you choose to limit the amount of personal information that can be collected from your computer, mobile or other device, you can do this by restricting cookies on your computer or device. However if you restrict the cookies on Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand websites, this may significantly reduce the functionality of our websites and we may not be able to process your online booking request. Other Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand services may also be affected.

We reserve the right, however, to deny or limit access or amendments to your personal information where we are entitled by law to do so (for example, where complying with the request could prejudice the prevention or detection of crime).</p>

<div class="accordion-content">
<p>We take care with our physical, technical, organisational and electronic security to protect your personal information against loss, damage, misuse, unauthorized access, erroneous disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>As part of our security measures, we use secure servers and industry standard data encryption for transmission of personal information on Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand websites, for example when you pay by credit card online. Known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol, you can check this is active by looking for the padlock symbol on many browsers. SSL allows a secure connection between your internet browser and our internet server, using a private (or secret) key to encrypt the information.</p>
<p>To protect your own privacy, you should not share your Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand booking reference number, Airpoints membership number, your online Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand Account password information, your personal identification numbers (PINs), mobile device passcodes, passwords or access codes with others including third-party information aggregators, as the sharing of these details could enable others to access your personal account information on our websites.</p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring the security of the personal information held on your computer, mobile or other device.</p>
