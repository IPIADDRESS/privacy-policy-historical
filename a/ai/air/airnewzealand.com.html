We also collect information about any giftees that you register on your Gifting Register.

Personal information collected for promotions can include your contact details and survey questions. If you do not provide us with this information then you may not be able to enter into the promotion.</p><h3>Cookies and Local Shared Objects</h3><p>A cookie or a local shared object is a small text file which we may put on your computer's hard drive in order to recognise your computer at a later time. A cookie or a local shared object cannot read your hard drive or perform any commands on your computer and does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address. A cookie helps us remember who you are. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.</p><p>We may use the information collected by cookies or by local shared objects to:</p><ul><li>track website usage patterns;</li><li>display content more relevant to you, based on information we collect when you visit our websites;</li><li>enable you to use certain services on our websites;</li><li>assess effectiveness of online and email advertising campaigns or improve the site's contents; and</li><li>recognise your preferred web page layout on our web pages.</li></ul><h3>Domain names</h3><p>In general, you can visit most parts of our websites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers, however, can identify the domain names and IP addresses of visitors.</p><h3>Off-line purchases: such as reservations by telephone, travel agent, or at the ticket counter</h3><p>When you book your reservation with an Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand reservations agent (including Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand Holidays), a travel agent (including online third party travel agents), a customer service representative or through the Airpoints Service Centre (together, "<b>Reservations Agents</b>"), the Reservations Agents may collect personal information such as your credit card details, bank account details, passport numbers, birth date, name, addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers. If you do not provide us with this information then we may not be able to complete your booking or if applicable, your refund. Telephone calls to Reservations Agents may be monitored and/or recorded and by continuing with the call, you are deemed to consent to the telephone call being monitored and/or recorded and your personal information being collected and used in accordance with the terms of this policy.</p><h3>Koru membership</h3><p>We may collect personal information such as name, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and credit card numbers, in order to provide membership benefits to Koru members. If you do not provide us with this information then we may not be able to accept your membership application or provide you with membership benefits.</p><h3>In-flight</h3><p>If a medical or other emergency occurs while onboard, boarding, or disembarking an Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand aircraft, we may collect and disclose personal information with third-party medical or other safety personnel as we consider may be necessary in our view in the circumstances.</p><h3>Minors</h3><p>Our websites are not intended for the use of minors under the age of 18. We do not knowingly market to, or solicit data, from minors. We cannot distinguish the age of persons who access and use our websites. If a minor (according to applicable laws) has provided us with personal information, without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the relevant personal information. Please see the section headed "Access to and correction of your personal information" below.</p><div class="rightalign"><a href="#top" title="Back to Top.

"></a></div><h2><a name="protection"></a><a name="protection"></a>Protection of your personal information</h2><p>When you book flights or access your Airpoints information via one of our websites, a secure server is used. We use industry standard data encryption for transmission of any personal information including credit card details you provide online. Known as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol, you can check this is active by looking for the padlock symbol on many browsers. SSL allows a secure connection between your web browser and our web server, using a private (or secret) key to encrypt the information. This encryption provides greater consumer protection than many forms of offline credit card payments.</p><p>We make no warranty (express or implied) in respect of the effectiveness of encryption used and we are not responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.</p><p>In order to protect your privacy and our databases/systems, we recommend that you not share any of your personal information, such as Airpoints membership number (Airpoints Personal Access Code) or password, with any third-party information aggregators that would allow them access to sensitive account information.</p><p>We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information we collect is secure, accurate and up to date and is protected against loss, theft and unauthorised use or modification.</p><p>Please contact us immediately if you believe that your personal information has not been protected as set out in the "<a href="#contact">Contact details</a>" section below.</p><h2><a name="links"></a><a name="links"></a>Links to other websites</h2><p>Our website provides links to other websites for your convenience and assistance. Please note that these websites may have different security and privacy policies. We do not accept any responsibility and/or liability for any information that you divulge to these websites and how those websites or the organisations that own and manage those websites collect, use or disclose your personal information or that of any person you provide on those sites.</p><h2>No guarantees</h2><p>While we will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that we collect and accordingly, personal information you provide to us is provided at your own risk.</p><div class="rightalign"><a href="#top" title="Back to Top.

"></a></div><h2><a name="use-info"></a><a name="use-info"></a>How do we use your personal information?</h2><p>The purposes for which your personal information will be used by us will depend on the circumstances in which that information is collected. For example, we may use the personal information we collect:</p><ul><li>to assist in providing the services you request, including flight bookings and identity verification for website access;</li><li>to process any communications you request;</li><li>to administer your membership in Airpoints and/or Koru;</li><li>to conduct surveys and internal research;</li><li>to provide flight reminder SMS alerts and other electronic information services;</li><li>to assist Customs and Immigration officials;</li><li>to comply with laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions;</li><li>to identify and present offers from us or from third parties that may be of interest to you; and</li><li>any other use that you authorise.</li></ul><p>We collect personal information in conjunction with registrations or purchases on our websites and off-line purchases and transactions and use such personal information for the purposes described in this policy.</p><p>We do not use personal information collected through this website or in person, in ways not described here, without first providing you with the opportunity to opt out of that use (for how to opt out, please see the section titled <a href="#promo-materials">"How can you opt out of receiving email communications and marketing or promotional materials?"</a> below).</p><p>We may disclose personal information received from you:</p><ul><li>where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious and imminent threat to an individual's life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health or public safety;</li><li>to third parties contracted by us in order to perform our services. For example, we may share your personal information with third party data processing agents we retain for any of the purposes described in this policy. We will take reasonable steps to require these third parties to comply with our instructions and not use your personal information for any other purpose;</li><li>within Air&nbsp;New&nbsp;Zealand in accordance with the law; and</li><li>where we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena or other legal process, as requested by a governmental or law enforcement authority, or when we believe in good faith that it is in the interests of aviation security or that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In particular, we are required by laws in a number of countries to disclose passenger information to customs and immigration authorities in those countries. Accordingly, any personal information we hold about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to the relevant authorities of any country named in your itinerary. </li></ul><p>There are some circumstances in which we will not be in a position to require third parties to comply with our policy. For example, where you use links on our website to access other websites there is no control by us over those websites (see the section titled "<a href="#links">Links to other websites</a>" above).</p><p>Disclosure of your personal information may include the transfer of your personal information between countries which is necessary for the purpose of completing the transaction and performing our services. These locations may include countries that do not have comparable laws protecting the privacy of personal information.</p><p>We provide further details below of how we use your personal information.</p><div class="rightalign"><a href="#top" title="Back to Top. "><img src="http://static.airnewzealand.com/themes/airnz001/images/backtotoparrow.gif" alt="Arrow.

As an added service, subject to your opting out (please see the section titled <a href="#promo-materials">"How can you opt out of receiving email communications and marketing or promotional materials?"</a>), your purchase behaviour may also be analysed to identify and present offers that may be of interest to you.</p><h3>Airpoints™</h3><p>We set out under the heading "Airpoints information" above the types of personal information we collect from Airpoints members and persons who apply for Airports membership. We collect personal information from Airpoints members to complete your membership and ensure that you receive applicable Airpoints&nbsp;Dollars™ for travel purchases and other Airpoints partner activities. We also use this information to communicate with you in relation to the Airpoints programme and notify you of any special promotions for which you might be eligible. On occasion, we may provide customer mailing list and email addresses to reputable, carefully-screened Airpoints partners or other companies whose services or products may be of interest to you. You may unsubscribe by opting-out (again please see the section titled <a href="#promo-materials">"How can you opt out of receiving email communications and marketing or promotional materials?"</a>).

Of course, if you would rather not receive this information, you may opt out of receiving such emails (please see the section titled <a href="#promo-materials">"How can you opt out of receiving email communications and marketing or promotional materials?"</a>).</p><h3>Online surveys</h3><p>We value the opinions of our customers and want to improve your travel experience and our service offerings, therefore, from time to time, we will conduct research surveys. We may also contract with third parties to perform the research, but the use of the customer data by that third party is limited solely to that survey initiative and is protected by a confidentiality agreement.</p><h3>Flight reminder alerts</h3><p>Our customers can register for Flight reminder SMS alerts and other electronic information services by providing basic flight information and other relevant information.
