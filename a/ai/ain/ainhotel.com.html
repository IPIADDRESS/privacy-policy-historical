					<br>
					This privacy policy applies only to the websites controlled 
					by Ainhotel Communications, LLC <br>
					and/or its subsidiary and affiliated entities ("Ainhotel," 
					"we" or "us") where this privacy <br>
					policy is posted (collectively, the "Sites"). This privacy 
					policy does not pertain to information <br>
					that is collected offline. BY USING THE SITES, YOU CONSENT 
					TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS <br>
					PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 
					FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF <br>
					YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY 
					POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES. <br>
					<br>
					A. Information Collected <br>
					<br>
					This privacy policy applies only to information collected on 
					the Sites and does not apply to <br>
					information collected by Ainhotel through any other means. 
					For details on the information <br>
					collected and used from children under the age of 13, click 
					here. We collect two types of <br>
					information from visitors to the Sites: (1) Personally 
					Identifiable Information; and (2) Non- <br>
					Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address 
					or cookies. <br>
					<br>
					(1) Personally Identifiable Information <br>
					<br>
					"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that 
					identifies you personally, such as your <br>
					name, address, telephone number, email address, or company 
					name. Ainhotel collects and stores the <br>
					personally identifiable information that you have provided 
					to us. Here are some examples of <br>
					manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable 
					information on the Sites: <br>
					<br>
					We may collect your email address, first and last name and 
					zip code if you sign up for an online <br>
					newsletter; <br>
					We may collect your email address if you contact us with a 
					question; <br>
					We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and 
					email address if you choose to <br>
					participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and <br>
					We may collect your first and last name, your address, and 
					your credit card and billing <br>
					information if you make a purchase of a product at the 
					Ainhotel Store. <br>
					The above list provides an example of the personally 
					identifiable information that may be <br>
					collected on the Sites. If you do not want Ainhotel to 
					collect your personally identifiable <br>
					information, please do not provide it to us. <br>
					<br>
					(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br>
					<br>
					"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical 
					information or it can be demographic <br>
					information, such as your age, gender or interests. 
					Non-personally identifiable information does <br>
					NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the 
					non-personally identifiable <br>
					information that is collected via the Sites and a 
					description of how this information is used: <br>
					<br>
					Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a 
					number that lets computers attached to the <br>
					Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages 
					you view. We use this information to <br>
					deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our 
					Sites to the interests of our users and <br>
					to measure traffic within our Sites. <br>
					Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used 
					to collect information about your <br>
					activity on the Sites. For example, when someone visits a 
					page within the Sites, a cookie is <br>
					placed on the user's machine (if the user accepts cookies) 
					or is read if the user has visited the <br>
					Sites previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if 
					you receive a cookie, or you may <br>
					choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, 
					you may not be able to take advantage <br>
					of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our 
					Sites. Some of the cookies we use may <br>
					be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, 
					they may contain Demographic <br>
					Information (defined below) and depending on your browser 
					these cookies may not normally be <br>
					deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your 
					browser to determine where these types <br>
					of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted. <br>
					Web Beacons (also known as "clear gifs," "web bugs" or 
					"pixel tags") -- "Web Beacons" are tiny <br>
					graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to 
					cookies, and are used to allow us to <br>
					count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites and 
					to help determine the effectiveness <br>
					of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in 
					HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons <br>
					can tell the sender whether and when the email has been 
					opened. In contrast to cookies, which are <br>
					stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are 
					embedded invisibly on web pages. <br>
					Demographic Information -- "Demographic Information" may be 
					your gender, age, zip code and <br>
					interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites. 
					We use this information to provide <br>
					you with personalized services and to analyze trends to 
					ensure the information provided by the <br>
					Sites meets your needs. For example, we offer personalized 
					TV schedule listings and program <br>
					reminders for Ainhotel Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, Ainhotel 
					Health Channel or any of our other <br>
					TV offerings if you tell us which programs and topics you're 
					interested in. Please note that we <br>
					also consider aggregated information, which is not 
					personally identifiable, to be non-personally <br>
					identifiable information. The above list provides an example 
					of the non-personally identifiable <br>
					information that is collected via the Sites. <br>
					We collect the above non-personally identifiable information 
					from all visitors to our Sites. If <br>
					you do not want Ainhotel to have access to this information, 
					please do not visit our Sites.<br>
					<br>
					B. Use of Information Collected Via the Sites <br>
					<br>
					(1) Personally Identifiable Information<br>
					<br>
					We use your personally identifiable information that is 
					collected on these Sites primarily for <br>
					the following purposes:<br>
					<br>
					To deliver services, such as educational programs, 
					information, newsletters or software you <br>
					request or purchase; <br>
					To alert you to special offers, updated information and 
					other new services from Ainhotel, or <br>
					other third parties, or to forward promotional materials;
					<br>
					To complete a transaction or service requested by you; <br>
					To fulfill the terms of a promotion; <br>
					To ensure the Sites are relevant to your needs; <br>
					To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;
					<br>
					To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy 
					or the Visitor Agreement, if <br>
					necessary; <br>
					To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites; and
					<br>
					To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact 
					Us or Order Inquiry. <br>
					(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br>
					<br>
					Non-personally identifiable information is used as described 
					above and in other ways as permitted <br>
					by applicable laws, including combining non-personally 
					identifiable information with personally <br>
					identifiable information (except with respect to 
					non-personally identifiable information <br>
					collected from children under the age of 13). <br>
					<br>
					C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information <br>
					<br>
					(1) Personally Identifiable Information<br>
					<br>
					We may share or disclose your personally identifiable 
					information in the following instances: <br>
					(i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you choose 
					to watch an educational program on <br>
					the Sites, we may share your personally identifiable 
					information in order to provide the program <br>
					to you. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use 
					your email address to process your <br>
					request and respond to your question. Also, if you are 
					entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may <br>
					use your personally identifiable information in order to 
					fulfill the terms of that promotion. <br>
					This means that we may share the information for prize 
					fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We <br>
					also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that 
					promotion. <br>
					(ii) To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party 
					marketers or other unaffiliated <br>
					parties who are offering products or services that we 
					believe may be of interest to you or who <br>
					require your personally identifiable information for 
					research, administrative and/or internal <br>
					business purposes. These parties may use your personally 
					identifiable information to contact you <br>
					with an offer or advertisement related to a product or 
					service, or they may use such information <br>
					for their own research, administration or business purposes. 
					If you do not want us to share your <br>
					personally identifiable information in this manner, please 
					do not provide us with this <br>
					information. <br>
					(iii) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents 
					or independent contractors who help <br>
					us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative 
					services to us (including, but not limited <br>
					to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer 
					service, maintaining and analyzing data, <br>
					sending customer communications on Ainhotel's behalf, and 
					entry collection, winner selection and <br>
					prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other 
					promotions). We seek to ensure that these <br>
					unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally 
					identifiable information for any other <br>
					purpose than to provide the administrative services for 
					which they are responsible. Because such <br>
					unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us 
					administer our Sites will have access to <br>
					users' personally identifiable information, if you do not 
					wish for our unaffiliated third-party <br>
					service providers to have access to your information, please 
					do not register or submit any <br>
					personally identifiable information to us. <br>
					(iv) To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a 
					purchase on the Sites, we may collect <br>
					from you your credit card number, billing address and other 
					information related to such purchase, <br>
					and we may use such collected information in order to 
					fulfill your purchase. We may also provide <br>
					such information, or other personally identifiable 
					information provided by you, to unaffiliated <br>
					third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for 
					example, to process your credit card). <br>
					(v) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that 
					such action is necessary in order to <br>
					conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal 
					process served on us, protect and defend <br>
					our rights or property, including the rights and property of 
					Ainhotel and its family of Sites or <br>
					act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety 
					of our end users. <br>
					(vi) To third parties as part of any corporate 
					reorganization process including, but not limited <br>
					to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially 
					all of our assets. <br>
					(vii) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate 
					usage and volume statistical information <br>
					from our visitors and customers and provide such information 
					to third parties. <br>
					(viii) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify 
					with third parties the information <br>
					collected from these Sites. In the course of such 
					verification, we may receive personally <br>
					identifiable information about you from such services. In 
					particular, if you use a credit card or <br>
					debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card 
					authorization and fraud screening <br>
					services to verify that your card information and address 
					matches the information that you <br>
					supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as 
					lost or stolen. <br>
					<br>
					Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we 
					request the information, we do not <br>
					otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally 
					identifiable information to any third <br>
					parties. <br>
					<br>
					(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information <br>
					<br>
					We use non-personally identifiable information collected on 
					the Sites in the manner disclosed <br>
					above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal 
					information with third parties. <br>
					<br>
					D. Collection and Use of Information from Children Under the 
					Age of 13 <br>
					<br>
					(1) Collection of Personally Identifiable Information 
					Collected from Kids <br>
					<br>
					In most instances, Ainhotel will only request the first name 
					and email address of the child in <br>
					order to complete an immediate request from the child. The 
					information that is collected will <br>
					only be used for the requested purpose and will be deleted 
					immediately. Ainhotel will not store <br>
					or otherwise use that information. Here are some examples of 
					instances in which Ainhotel may <br>
					immediately delete the child's information after the 
					completion of the child's initial request: <br>
					<br>
					If the child emails an inquiry; <br>
					If the child participates in a game; <br>
					If the child refers a game to a friend, we may request his 
					or her first name and email address <br>
					and the friend's first name and email address; <br>
					If the child wants to receive a postcard on one occasion; 
					and <br>
					If the child sends a postcard to a friend on one occasion, 
					we may request his or her first name <br>
					and email address and the friend's first name and email 
					address. <br>
					From time to time, we may request limited personally 
					identifiable information from kids in order <br>
					to offer a service, a promotion or other activity to the 
					kids. In such an instance, we will <br>
					request that the child provide his or her email address, as 
					well as the email address of his or <br>
					her parent or legal guardian ("parent"). Ainhotel will use 
					that email address to send the parent <br>
					an email letting him or her know about the child's contact. 
					The email will include details on how <br>
					the parent may (i) provide Ainhotel with consent; (ii) 
					prohibit Ainhotel from any further contact <br>
					with the child; or (iii) delete the child's personally 
					identifiable information. Ainhotel will <br>
					not collect more information than is reasonably necessary 
					for the child to participate in the <br>
					activity at issue. <br>
					<br>
					Below are some examples of instances in which we may collect 
					the first name and email address <br>
					from kids on the Sites and require parental consent: <br>
					<br>
					If the child wants to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other 
					promotion; and <br>
					If the child wants to receive newsletters on a recurring 
					basis. <br>
					(2) Use of Personally Identifiable Information Collected 
					from Kids <br>
					<br>
					When we collect personally identifiable information from 
					kids, we will only use that information <br>
					for the express purpose for which it was collected. For 
					example, if a child enters a sweepstakes, <br>
					we will request the parent's information (as described in 
					Section D(1)) and will only use the <br>
					child's email address to enter the child into the 
					sweepstakes, to notify the parent of the <br>
					child's entry, and to identify and notify the child if he or 
					she is a potential winner. The <br>
					personally identifiable information will not be used for any 
					other purpose, and the personally <br>
					identifiable information will not be used after the 
					promotion is complete. <br>
					<br>
					(3) Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information Collected 
					from Kids <br>
					<br>
					Except as provided in this Section, we do not share 
					personally identifiable information collected <br>
					from kids with any unaffiliated third parties. We may, 
					however, share a child's personally <br>
					identifiable information that we have collected with 
					parental consent in the following limited <br>
					instances: <br>
					<br>
					We may share such information with third-party service 
					providers who help Ainhotel maintain the <br>
					Sites and provide other administrative services to us. We 
					seek to ensure that these unaffiliated <br>
					third parties may not use the personally identifiable 
					information for any other purpose, and <br>
					these unaffiliated third parties have agreed to maintain the 
					confidentiality, security and <br>
					integrity of the personally identifiable information. <br>
					If your child is selected as a potential winner of one of 
					our contests or sweepstakes, we will <br>
					notify the parent, via the email address that the child 
					submitted. If the parent consents, we <br>
					will collect and share this information in order to fulfill 
					the terms of the promotion. <br>
					Finally, we may disclose kids' personally identifiable 
					information to third parties if we believe <br>
					we are required to do so in order to comply with law 
					(including court orders and subpoenas); to <br>
					comply with requests from law enforcement agencies or the 
					government; to enforce our Visitor <br>
					Agreement; to protect our rights, privacy, safety or 
					property and the rights, privacy, safety or <br>
					property of our employees or other users of our Sites; to 
					protect our operations; and to permit <br>
					us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we 
					may sustain. <br>
					(4) Non Personally Identifiable Information <br>
					<br>
					We collect and store the non-personally identifiable 
					information that is described in Section A2 <br>
					of this privacy policy. We do not, however, link this 
					information to personally identifiable <br>
					information when it is collected from kids. <br>
					<br>
					(5) Note to Parents and Legal Guardians <br>
					<br>
					Please contact Ainhotel at any time regarding privacy 
					questions or concerns, or to request to <br>
					review what personally identifiable information we have 
					collected from a child. Parents may also <br>
					contact us at any time to request that we delete the 
					personally identifiable information of a <br>
					child or a parent and/or refuse to permit further collection 
					or use of a child's information. We <br>
					will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for 
					a child's information is that child's <br>
					parent or guardian. <br>

					E. International Transfer of Information <br>
					<br>
					If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable 
					information, Ainhotel may transfer that <br>
					information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other 
					third parties, across borders, and <br>
					from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or 
					jurisdictions around the world. If you <br>
					are visiting from the European Union or other regions with 
					laws governing data collection and use <br>
					that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are 
					transferring your personally identifiable <br>
					information to the United States which does not have the 
					same data protection laws as the EU and <br>
					by providing your personally identifiable information you 
					consent to: <br>
					<br>
					the use of your personally identifiable information for the 
					uses identified above in accordance <br>
					with this privacy policy; and <br>
					the transfer of your personally identifiable information to 
					the United States as indicated above. <br>
					F. Opt-Out <br>
					<br>
					We communicate with users who subscribe to our services on a 
					regular basis via email. For <br>
					example, we may use your email address to confirm your 
					request, to send you notice of payments, <br>
					to send you information about changes to our products and 
					services, and to send notices and other <br>
					disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot 
					opt-out of these communications, but they <br>
					will be primarily informational in nature rather than 
					promotional. <br>
					<br>
					However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an 
					opt-out choice if you do not want to <br>
					receive other types of communication from us, such as emails 
					or updates from us regarding new <br>
					services and products offered on this Site or if you do not 
					want us to share your personally <br>
					identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out 
					choice may be exercised by ticking or <br>
					un-ticking the appropriate box if such checkbox is available 
					at the points where personally <br>
					identifiable information is collected or by contacting us. 
					We will process your unsubscribe as <br>
					soon as possible, but please be aware that in some 
					circumstances you may receive a few more <br>
					messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may 
					opt-out of receiving such emails by <br>
					clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of the 
					email. <br>
					<br>
					G. Forums, Chat Rooms and Other Public Posting Areas<br>
					<br>
					Please note that any information you include in a message 
					you post to any chat room, forum or <br>
					other public posting area is available to anyone with 
					Internet access. If you don't want people <br>
					to know your e-mail address, for example, don't include it 
					in any message you post publicly. <br>
					PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION 
					IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER <br>
					PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY 
					OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU <br>
					DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING 
					AREAS. <br>
					<br>
					H. Third Party Web Sites <br>
					<br>
					This statement applies solely to information collected on 
					the Sites. The Sites may contain links <br>
					to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy 
					practices or the content of these <br>
					other web sites. <br>
					<br>
					I. Third Party Advertisers <br>
					<br>
					We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other 
					advertising companies, to serve <br>
					advertisements on the Sites. Please be advised that such 
					advertising companies may gather <br>
					information about your visit to the Sites or other sites 
					(such as through cookies, web beacons <br>
					and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies 
					to market products or services to <br>
					you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser 
					and which webpages you were viewing <br>
					when such ads were delivered. If you would like more 
					information about this practice and to know <br>
					your choices please click here. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY 
					DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND <br>
					USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES. <br>
					<br>
					J. Accessing Your Personally Identifiable Information and 
					Privacy Preferences <br>
					<br>
					We provide you with an opportunity to access your personally 
					identifiable information to ensure <br>
					it is correct, accurate and current. To edit your personally 
					identifiable information, please <br>
					contact our customer service representatives at 
					1-800-889-9950. To be removed from our mailing <br>

					are not able <br>
					to update or edit your personally identifiable information

					information by contacting us as described below. We will 
					make reasonable efforts to accommodate <br>
					your request. <br>
					<br>
					K. Assignment <br>
					<br>
					In the event that all or part of our assets or sold or 
					acquired by another party, or in the event <br>
					of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the personally 
					identifiable and non-personally <br>
					identifiable information collected via the Sites. <br>
					<br>
					L. Changes to this Privacy Policy <br>
					<br>
					We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time 
					to time. When we do, we will also <br>
					revise the "last update" date at the bottom of this privacy 
					policy. For changes to this privacy <br>
					policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or 
					disclosure of personal information <br>
					you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your 
					consent before implementing the change by <br>
					sending a notice to the primary email address specified in 
					your account or by placing a prominent <br>
					notice on the Sites. <br>
					<br>
					We will also notify parents if we change the kinds of 
					information that we collect from kids and <br>
					materially alter our practices of sharing and using this 
					information. We will not collect, use or <br>
					share the information without parental consent. <br>
					<br>
					M. Security <br>
					<br>
					No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to 
					be 100% secure. Consequently, we <br>
					cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
					transmit to us and you understand <br>
					that any information that you transfer to Ainhotel is done 
					at your own risk. <br>
					<br>
					Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable 
					efforts to ensure security on our systems. <br>
					We use firewalls to protect your information from 
					unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or <br>
					destruction. However, please note that this is not a 
					guarantee that such information may not be <br>
					accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such 
					firewalls and secure server software. <br>
					<br>
					If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to 
					notify you electronically so that you <br>
					can take appropriate protective steps. By using these Sites 
					or providing personally identifiable <br>
					information to us you agree that we can communicate with you 
					electronically regarding security, <br>
					privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of 
					these Sites. We may post a notice on <br>
					our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an 
					email to you at the email address you <br>
					have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on 
					where you live, you may have a legal <br>
					right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. <br>
					<br>
					N. Age Screening <br>
					<br>
					Some parts of the Sites require that personally identifiable 
					information be submitted in order to <br>
					participate. For example, if you want to receive one of our 
					newsletters, you must give us your <br>
					email address. Some parts of the Sites will have an 
					age-screening mechanism to prevent kids from <br>
					registering. We won't knowingly allow anyone under the age 
					of thirteen to register with any of <br>
					our Sites, or to access those features that require 
					registration, except as explicitly disclosed <br>
					herein. If we become aware that we have inadvertently 
					received personally identifiable <br>
					information from a user under the age of thirteen other than 
					in a legally permissible situation, <br>
					we will delete the information from our records as soon as 
					we discover it. <br>
					<br>

					privacy practices, please contact us <br>
