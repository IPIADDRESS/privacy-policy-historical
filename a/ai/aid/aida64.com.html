Credit  card information and sensitive personal data are not used for any other  purpose by our financial services providers or FinalWire and will not be  kept longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us  to retain your credit card information for future purchases.

FinalWire will not share your personal information  with third parties except in responding to your requests for products or  services. Your permission will be requested when you submit your  information. FinalWire shares customer information across FinalWire-owned  business entities and companies working on our behalf, but only as  described above in "How we use your information."
</p>
<p>FinalWire contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver  complete products, services and customer solutions described in "How we  use your information." Suppliers and service providers are required to  keep confidential the information received on behalf of FinalWire and may  not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are  performing for FinalWire. These service providers may change or we may  contract with additional service providers to better accommodate our  customers. FinalWire will not share personal information with any other  third parties without your permission, unless required by law  enforcement action, subpoena, or local law.</p>
<p>FinalWire or its related  entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity or  some or all of their respective assets could be acquired. If such a  combination or acquisition occurs, FinalWire will make every reasonable  effort to notify you in the event we share with the merging or acquiring  entity some or all of your personal information to continue serving  you.</p>
<h2>6. Your choices</h2>
<p>FinalWire gives you the choice of  receiving a variety of information that complements our products and  services. You can subscribe to receive certain product- and  service-specific information and FinalWire-wide marketing communications.  FinalWire-wide communications may include new product information, special  offers, or an invitation to participate in market research. We give you  a choice regarding delivery of FinalWire-wide communications by postal  mail, e-mail and telephone. Please refer to section 7 for further  instructions. We will make every effort to honour your preferences. This  option does not apply to communications for the purpose of  administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety  warnings or driver updates.</p>
<h2>7. Your privacy preferences and  opting out</h2>
<p>  <strong><em>Non-subscription services</em></strong><br><br>
  FinalWire will  not use your personal information for a different purpose than the one  stated when you provided your data. Examples of unrelated uses include  sending communications about special offers, product information, and  marketing messages. You can, however, choose to receive these types of  non-subscription communications by following the instructions below.</p>
<p><em><strong>Subscription  services </strong></em><br><br>
  To opt-out of receiving communications you have  expressly requested (such as e-mail newsletters, software updates,  etc.), use any of the following methods:</p>
<p>Select the e-mail  "opt-out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions  included in each subscription communication<br><br>
  Return to the Web page(s)  where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out  instructions<br><br>
  Write to the FinalWire Privacy Office (<a href="/contact-finalwire">contact form</a>) –  be sure to provide your name, e-mail and postal address, and relevant  information about your FinalWire subscriptions and registrations</p>
<h2>8.  Your information and third-party companies</h2>
<p>Certain FinalWire  services are linked with those from unrelated third-party companies,  some which offer you the option to share with both FinalWire and the third  party personal data you provide. Examples include the ability to  register software products from multiple vendors from a single FinalWire  Web page, to request communications from FinalWire marketing or solution  partners, or to enable order completion through a reseller. We will not  share your personal information with those third-party companies unless  you make that choice.</p>
<h2>9. Access to and accuracy of your  information</h2>
<p>FinalWire strives to keep your personal information  accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and  policies to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with  access to your information, including making reasonable effort to  provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your  information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take  reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user  ID, before granting access to your data. Certain areas of FinalWire'  websites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of  passwords and other personal identifiers.</p>
<p>The most effective way  to view and change your personal information is to return to the Web  page where you originally submitted your data and follow the  instructions on that Web page.</p>
<h2>10. Keeping your information  secure</h2>
<p>FinalWire is committed to protecting the information you  provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain  data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information,  FinalWire has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to  safeguard the information we collect.</p>
<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer  (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as  credit card information. SSL encryption is designed to make the  information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is  working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock  (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.</p>
<p>Credit  card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for  other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, FinalWire  subscribes to a fraud management service. This service gives you and  FinalWire an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud to  protect your financial data.</p>
<h2>11. Changes to this Statement</h2>
<p>If  there are updates to the terms of FinalWire' Online Privacy Statement, we  will post those changes and update the revision date in this document,  so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use  it, and what choices you have. For material changes to this Statement,  FinalWire will provide notification to affected customers.</p>
<h2>12.  Contacting us</h2>
<p>We value your opinions. If you have comments or questions about our privacy policy, please fill our <a href="/contact-finalwire">contact form</a>.</p>
<p>1 - A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the global  address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For  example, <a href="http://www.aida64.com/" title="http://www.aida64.com/">http://www.aida64.com/</a> is the URL for main FinalWire home page in Budapest, Hungary.</p>
<p>2 -  An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a  Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such  as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route  information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words,  an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your  computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to  locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in  order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>

<p>I used AIDA(32) since it was born. It was then and is now just an easy way to gather information about the hardware and software installed on any PC. In our reviews we use it to check if mainboards read SPDs correctly, if the hardware monitoring tools are working properly and to check the CPU temperatures. Of course no product is perfect, but the response-time of the AIDA team is just incredible fast which enables them to improve their product further. While 64-bit OSes are out for years, most software still trails years behind. We are glad that AIDA64 has moved to 64-bit.</p>
