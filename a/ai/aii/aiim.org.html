</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
AIIM International is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  AIIM International collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Orders and Registrations</b><br>
We request information from the user on our various order and registration forms.  Here, a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site and control vital features of the site, such as personalization and the type of value-added content that is suggested or offered during your browsing experience.</font> 
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Log Files</b><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  Data collected allows us to provide site enhancements and troubleshoot problems.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Registered User Accounts</b><br>
Our portal operates under the notion of a registered user of the site to provide relevant, personalized content and access to premium content.  All of the information obtained during your registration and, subsequently, contained in your website user account are available only to AIIM staff for purposes of customer service and account management.  Any information that personally identifies you or your use of our site is not released to any third party.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Sharing</b><br>
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and trade members. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
We partner with other outside parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.</font> 
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Links</b><br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AIIM International is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Newsletters and Listserv</b><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters and/or Listserv, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address.</font> 
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.  Any other survey or contest that deviates from this stated policy will explicitly state this from the survey or contest page.</font>

</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Security</b><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.  To learn more about SSL, please see the Verisign website, the provider of our secure certificates.</font>    
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees use workstation locking to protect access to their personal workstation when not at their desks.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked door.  User data is not stored on individual workstations or notebook computers.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:rpalarea@aiim.org?Subject=Privacy Policy, website security">rpalarea@aiim.org</a>.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Site and Service Updates</b><br>
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Registered users of the website and Members of AIIM International are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone.</font>
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b><br>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the update information page or by e-mailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:mbrdev@aiim.org">mbrdev@aiim.org</a>.</font> 
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, an order form may have an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want to be notified of changes, promotions or be sent any additional correspondence, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists.</font>  
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:optout@aiim.org">optout@aiim.org</a>.</font> 
</p><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</font>
</p></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</font></font></p></td>
