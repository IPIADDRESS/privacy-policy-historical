        Collection of payments online</h4>
        <p>When you provide payment information for an online transaction such as product and
        service orders, submission of membership dues, or payment of meeting registration we
        generally request:</p><ul>
          <li>your credit card type </li>
          <li>number </li>
          <li>and expiration date.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><br>
        Information you provide when you send us e-mail</h4>
        <p>The AIChEWeb lists numerous departmental and individual e-mail contacts to assist our
        customers with all facets of interaction with AIChE. When you send us an e-mail and
        request a response, we use the e-mail address you have provided to respond to your
        inquiry. We may periodically log the nature of these e-mail requests to help us analyze
        visitor interests overall and identify areas for improvement on the site.</p>
        <h4><br>
        Information you provide when you participate in other transaction forums</h4>
        <p>If you post messages in our Meeting Development Area or other online discussion forums,
        AIChE staff or organization volunteers may have access to your e-mail addresses and other
        personal information that you provide. AIChE does not regularly collect and store e-mail
        addresses from its online forums, though current e-mail addresses may be collected to
        further the work of the committee or group involved in the discussion.</p>
        <h4><a name="secure"></a><br>
        Secure server</h4>
        <p>When you are performing transactions on the AIChEWeb, you are utilizing our secure
        storefront server, which encrypts all of your personal information, including name,
        address, and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use your
        personal information. Our 128 bit encryption is implemented on SSL 3.0 with a certificate
        from Verisign, Inc., the same used by banks and brokerage houses. Click on the icon below
        for verification.</p>
        <p align="center"><a href="javascript:popUp('https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/2cd9a2e5a49b9779dcce32d48bc6ae2e')"><img alt="VeriSign Information for this Site" border="0" height="60" src="https://www.aiche-mart.org/_images/_verisignlogo.gif" width="96"></a></p>
        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> the Macintosh version of Internet Explorer does not
        support this functionality. </p>
        <p>If you think your credit card has been compromised as a result of performing a
        transaction on the AIChEWeb, please contact your credit card provider immediately. Most
        banks either cover all charges, or limit your liability to $50. </p>
        <h4><br>
        Summary of basic information maintained by AIChE</h4>
        <p>We may check the information you have provided via forms, e-mail, or forums against any
        information we have about you in our enterprise database. We do this to ensure that we
        have the most current and accurate information about our stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Our member/constituent database may contain your name, title, affiliation, industry
        classification, address, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, if you provided this
        information. We also record your participation with AIChEâ€“your attendance at major
        meetings, leadership activities, publications, membership status, products purchased, etc.
        </p>
        <h4><br>
        Use of "cookies"</h4>
        <p>When you order products or participate in on-line processes on the AIChEWeb, our server
        places a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a short line of code that takes
        up a miniscule amount of room on your hard drive. Many Websites use cookies to process
        online orders and maintain customer records.</p>
        <p>AIChE uses cookies to keep track of your product requests and on-line transactions with
        AIChE. AIChE does not use cookies to collect any personal information about you, nor do we
        sell or make available to other organizations any of the information in your AIChE
        cookies. </p>
        <p>You may disable the cookies function on your browser or erase the contents in your
        cookies file. To do this, consult the help features in your program manager and browser. <strong>Warning</strong>:
        certain function on the AIChEWeb rely upon cookies being active.</p>
        <h4><br>
        Third-party use of information you voluntarily provide at the AIChE Website</h4>
        <p>From time to time, AIChE rents portions of its mailing list to reputable third parties.
        We generally supply mailing labels, or in some cases a magnetic tape, to a bonded mailing
        house who destroys the tape after use. This reduces the likelihood that the mailing list
        will be entered into the third party's promotional database.</p>
        <p>AIChE may be required to provide information about any of its customers or prospective
        customers to law enforcement or government agencies if requested and/or as we feel
        necessary.</p>
        <p>AIChE reserves the right to change this policy in any manner at any time without prior
        notice.</p></td>
