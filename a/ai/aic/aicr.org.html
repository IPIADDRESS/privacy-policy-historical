<ul>
<li>For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes

not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.<br></li>
<li>If you supply us with your postal address on-line, it will be used to supply 
you with the requested information or materials for which it was provided. In

cancer research and education programs. Should you wish not to be contacted, please 
let us know by writing to the above address, or by contacting us via email at 
<a href="mailto:aicrweb@aicr.org.">aicrweb@aicr.org.</a><br></li>

<p> <b>What security measures does AICR have in place to protect information provided
