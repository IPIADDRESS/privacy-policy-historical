<h5>1. Introduction.</h5>
<p>Aries Systems Corporation (Aries Systems), is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of each User of the Website. This Privacy Policy explains under what circumstances Aries Systems and/or the Publishers (Aries Systems and Publishers shall be referred to in this Privacy Policy, collectively, as we, us, or our) gather information relating to each User (referred to in this Privacy Policy as you or your), how we use such information, and who may access that information. This Privacy Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Use. All defined terms used in this Privacy Policy that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised by us periodically. We advise that you review this Privacy Policy whenever you visit the Website so that you are aware of any changes.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, Publisher shall mean any organization to which Aries Systems provides Web Services, and Publication shall mean any intellectual manifestation created or controlled by the Publisher.</p>
<p>Aries Systems Corporation complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information&nbsp;transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.&nbsp;Aries Systems Corporation has certified&nbsp;to the Department of Commerce&nbsp;that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.&nbsp;If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.&nbsp;To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Aries Systems Corporation’s certification, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/list">http://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>.</p>
<p><a name="collection"></a></p>
<h5>2. Collection of Personal Information.</h5>
<p>There are two primary methods through which we may collect personal information from you. The first method is in connection with the establishment of your user account. The specific personally identifiable information that we collect in connection with the account registration process (“Registration Information”) may vary depending on the specific requirements of the Publisher or the Publication, but typically includes your name, e-mail address, and the name of the institution or association with which you are affiliated. During the registration process, we may also collect other information, such as your address and telephone number.</p>
<p>The second method is when you make personally identifiable information available while using the Website, the Software or the Services (“User Information”). You may make User Information available in connection with the submission, editing, and/or review of a Manuscript, and/or the uploading, submission, or transmission of other User Submissions. For example, if you are an Author and elect to submit a Manuscript, you have the option of providing additional information that you believe may be of interest to the Publisher or the Publication, such as your age, gender, race, life or professional experiences, and academic or professional qualifications. Alternatively, a Publisher or Publication may request that you provide certain information in connection with the submission of a Manuscript, including information such as your age, gender, race, protected status, life or professional experiences, and academic or professional qualifications.</p>
<p>While User Information may assist in the review and publication process, you are under no obligation to provide any User Information. Aries Systems does not monitor the nature of User Information that may be requested by the Publisher or the Publication or User Information that is submitted or provided by User, and does not represent or warrant that such User Information may be requested or provided under applicable law. As such, we encourage you to carefully consider whether to provide any User Information, and to raise any questions or concerns that you may have relating to a request for Personal Information directly with the Publisher or the Publication making such request.</p>
<p><a name="our"></a></p>
<h5>3. Our Use and Sharing of Your Personal Information.</h5>
