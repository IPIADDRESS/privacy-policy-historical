      <p class="style3">Last Updated: January 30, 2007</p>
      <p class="style3">Verge-Soft.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet   technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use   Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,   telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never   sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.   Period."</p>
      <p class="style3"><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
      <p class="style3">How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,   the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For   example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to   certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or   when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in   sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive   areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Verge-Soft.com also collects information   automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to   our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider   or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit.   Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing   you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control   the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our   site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through   other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with   information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,   but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be   asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to   customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</p>
      <p class="style3"><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
      <p class="style3">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and   deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and   do not share your information with anyone.</p>
      <p class="style3">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)   may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your   usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help   enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or   what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be   shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does   not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to   identify you individually.</p>
      <p class="style3">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Verge-Soft.com to   communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our   Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by   Verge-Soft.com and other topics we think you might find of interest. </p>
      <p class="style3">Personally Identifiable Information collected by Verge-Soft.com may also be   used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,   troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of   sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third   parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web   hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your   information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we   continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other   companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the   transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court   order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by   law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to   law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please   note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such   cases.</p>
      <p class="style3"><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
      <p class="style3">Verge-Soft.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect   the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our   partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through   our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.   For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a   frame on a Verge-Soft.com page, certain content that is actually created or   hosted by a third party. Also, through Verge-Soft.com you may be introduced to,   or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes   offered by other parties. Verge-Soft.com is not responsible for the actions or   policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies   of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated   by a third party.</p>
      <p class="style3">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third   parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your   preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our   advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the   advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.   Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third   parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.   Verge-Soft.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or   the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of   such third parties.</p>
      <p class="style3">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally   Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information   can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without   our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or   third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Verge-Soft.com and this   policy.</p>
      <p class="style3"><strong>Children</strong></p>
      <p class="style3">Verge-Soft.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable   Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we   discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of   this policy, we will delete that information immediately.

      <p class="style3"><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
