Welcome to the Arirang.co.kr
Arirang.co.kr takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this Arirang.co.kr  
Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

1. The Information We Collect
User will be ask to summit personal information about yourself ( eg name, and email address etc ) in order to receive or use services on our website.
Arirang.co.kr is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  Arirang.co.kr collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

2. Registration
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the membership registration form.  During registration a user is required to give certain personal information such as name, birth date and email address etc.  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information ( such as occupation and gender ).
 
3. Agreement
We request information and agreement from the user on our membership registration form.  Here a user must provide information ( like name and email address) and agreement that you understand the Arirang.co.kr's Private Policy.  This information is used for better services on Arirang.co.kr.  If you have troubles or questions to agree Arirang.co.kr's private policy, this contact information may be used ( security@arirangtv.co.kr).

4. Purpose
The information collected by arirang.co.kr is used for various service uses including online events, and survey. (From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contents.  
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information ( such as name and email address), and demographic information ( such as nation, age level ).  Content information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.)

5. Supplementation of Information
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

6. Correction/Updating Personal Information:
If a user's personally identifiable information changes ( such as your email address ), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our webmaster ( webmaster@arirang.co.kr ).

7. Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or ID(Passport) number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry. 
While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the important we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you are send an email to security@arirang.co.kr

8. Sharing
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with another party to provide specific services.  When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

9. Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site ( for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

10. Etc
Special Offers
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.

Links
This web site contains links to other sites.  Please be aware that we(Arirang.co.kr) are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Site and Service Updates
We also send the user site and service announcement updates.  Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.  We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email.

Newsletter

Log Files
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
