			<p><strong>Version 2.0, Effective Date: 4 October 2008</strong>            </p>
			<p>The American  Registry for Internet Numbers (“ARIN”) values the privacy of our customers and visitors  to our website (the “Site”), and information submitted to us  electronically.&nbsp; The following statement  explains ARIN’s Privacy Policy and privacy practices (the “Policy”). The Policy  does not govern ARIN’s treatment of information you voluntarily post to  publicly accessible forums.&nbsp; By using the  Site and ARIN’s services, you accept the terms of this Policy and consent to  the collection and use of information by ARIN in accordance with this  Policy.&nbsp; If you do not accept the terms  of this Policy, please do not use the Site or ARIN’s services.&nbsp;</p>
			<h3>              Overview</h3>
			<p>			  ARIN will  only collect information ARIN reasonably believes is appropriate and relevant  to the purpose for which it is being collected. ARIN does not collect any  personal or organizational information from you unless you personally,  explicitly, and intentionally provide it to us.</p>
			<h3>              General Data Collection</h3>
			<p>We collect and store general characteristics of the users of ARIN  services, including but not limited to, pages visited, operating system,  browser version and Internet Protocol (IP) address of client sessions. This  information is used in summary form to analyze usage trends and to help us  understand how our services are used. ARIN does not attempt to link general  characteristic data to individuals. Under some circumstances, this information  may be used to troubleshoot service issues or investigate security matters.</p>
			<h3>			  Collection  of Voluntarily Submitted Data</h3>
			<p>			  ARIN  provides services that may require collection of personally identifiable  information about you and each organization on whose behalf you have the legal  authority to act (each an “Authorized Organization”). In using the Site or ARIN’s  services, including but not limited to Internet resource applications, the  membership application form, the meeting registration system, survey forms and  resource-related systems (collectively, the “Services”), you may be asked to  provide personally identifiable information, including but not limited to name,  postal address, phone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses, business tax  identification numbers, financial information, and business plans. If you  choose to use the Services and submit personally identifiable information about  yourself or an Authorized Organization, ARIN may collect and link general user  characteristics to this information. We collect, retain and use this  information only to the extent we reasonably believe necessary to administer  our business, provide the requested Services, protect the integrity of our  business practices and secure our systems from unauthorized or abusive  access.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
			<h3>Mailing  Lists, Wikis and Public Forums </h3>
		<p>If  you use ARIN’s public mailing lists, public wikis or other public forum tools  that are intended for collaborative information sharing, any personal or  organizational information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by  other users of these forums.&nbsp; ARIN is not responsible for the personal or  organizational information you choose to submit in these forums.&nbsp; You are  also responsible for using these forums in a manner consistent with the  Acceptable Use Policy or other terms and conditions of the relevant forum site.<strong></strong></p>
            <h3>Use of Collected Data</h3>
            <p>        ARIN will  not sell, lease or otherwise give your personal or organizational information  to third parties except in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When  we need to share your information to provide you with any information or  Service you have requested from ARIN, or if we need to share your information  with third parties who maintain the Site or any successor website for us;</li>
              <li>When  we have your consent to share the information;</li>
              <li>If  we are required to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process;</li>
              <li>If  we discover that you have violated any of ARIN’s service policies or usage guidelines,  or any other contracts between you or your Authorized Organization and ARIN,  and such disclosure is required to enforce obligations, rights or laws;</li>
              <li>If we transfer operations to a permitted assignee or successor agency. </li>
            </ul>
        <p>ARIN may process personal or organizational information  on servers anywhere in the world, including but not limited to the United  States. In some cases, we may process personal or organizational information on  a server outside your own country.</p>
        <h3>                Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>Portions of the Site use cookies,  which are small files stored by your Web browser. The Site stores randomly  generated identifying information in the cookies. The Site uses this  information to distinguish among visitors and to customize your browsing  experience. Although cookies provide an enhanced browsing experience, the ARIN  website will function without their use; however, some functionality may be  limited without their use.</p>
        <h3> Security  and Reliability of Digital Transmissions</h3>
        <p>          ARIN maintains security procedures to protect the data transmitted to us  and to prevent unauthorized access to, alteration or deletion of customer  information.&nbsp; However, some  means of communications may not be secure or reliable, and there is a risk that  information you send to ARIN via the Site or may  be accessed by unauthorized third parties or may not be received by ARIN.&nbsp; ARIN does not represent, warrant or guarantee  that information you send to ARIN will be protected against unauthorized  access, loss, misuse or alteration.</p>
        <h3>          <strong>Updating  Information </strong></h3>
        <p>          You may update your information or that of an Authorized Organization  by submitting the new information through any means made available by ARIN.&nbsp; You may delete your account with ARIN;  however, information you submitted prior to termination may be retained for our  records and/or in our archives.</p>
        <h3>          Links to Other Websites </h3>
        <p>        Our website  contains links to other sites.&nbsp; ARIN is not  responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or content of these  other sites and does not intend to endorse, affirm or support the  content, viewpoint, policies, products or services of any linked site.</p>
        <h3>          Unauthorized Use</h3>
        <p>          Unauthorized  attempts to access, modify, add or delete any information on or through ARIN  systems, to defeat or circumvent security features, or to utilize its systems  for any use other than their intended purposes are prohibited. Such actions may  result in criminal prosecution.</p>
        <h3>          Compliance and Questions</h3>

        <h3>          Changes to the Policy</h3>
        ARIN  reserves the right to amend this Policy and ARIN’s privacy practices at any  time without notice by posting a revised Policy to the Site.&nbsp; By continuing to use the Site or ARIN’s  Services after the Policy is changed, you indicate your acceptance of the  Policy as revised.&nbsp; Therefore, you should  review this Policy periodically to check for changes.<!-- #EndEditable -->		</div>
