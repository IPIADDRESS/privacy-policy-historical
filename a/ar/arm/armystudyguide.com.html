<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>
<li>Aggregated information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How We Collect Non-Personal Information </strong></p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose Non-Personal Information </strong></p>
<p>Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose. &nbsp;In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). &nbsp;If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>

<p><strong>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site. &nbsp;We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

<p><strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link or a widget on our site. &nbsp;The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates. &nbsp;We may also utilize framing techniques that may make it appear that you are still on the site when you are actually on a third party web site.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party VENDORS</strong></p>
<p>We also work with vendors and partners in operating and improving the Site.&nbsp; These vendors and other partners include advertisers (including both banner and text advertising), retargeters and web analytics companies. &nbsp;These partners and vendors use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at the Site and at times other third party sites) in order to: help manage ad campaigns, understand user interests and trends and deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on the Site or on other sites. &nbsp;You can opt out of some of our vendors' use of cookies and other technologies to tailor personalized content or advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>.
