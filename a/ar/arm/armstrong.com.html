            NOTICE: Information We Collect and How We Use It<br>
            </u></b>Armstrong collects two types of information about you when
            you visit our site: personal information (including, by way of
            example only, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail
            address) and non-personal, aggregate information (such as
            information regarding the pages on our site that you have visited
            and your IP address).</p>
            <b><u>
            <p>1. Personally-Identifiable Information – What We Collect</p>
            </u></b>
            <p>The only personally-identifying information we collect and store
            about you is the information that you choose to provide to us.</p>
            <u>
            <p>Your Personal Portfolio</p>
            </u>
            <p>The Armstrong portfolio is an easy way to keep track of the
            Armstrong products you like. Visitors can establish a portfolio by
            submitting their name (required), physical and e-mail addresses and
            telephone number (optional), and by choosing a password (required).
            To access the portfolio, visitors will be required to enter their
            username (a combination of their first and last names) and password.</p>
            <u>
            <p>Electronic Mail</p>
            </u>
            <p>We will also gather your personally-identifiable information when
            you send us an e-mail. We will use this information to respond to
            your e-mail. We may also use the information to send you
            notifications about our service.</p>
            <u>
            <p>Sweepstakes and Contests</p>
            </u>
            <p>From time to time, we may request information from you in
            connection with sweepstakes and contests we offer on our Web site.
            Participation in these sweepstakes or contests is completely
            voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose this
            information. Information requested may include contact information
            (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information
            (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to
            notify the winners and award prizes.</p>
            <p>Armstrong may co-sponsor sweepstakes and contests with other
            companies, in which case the user’s individual contact and
            demographic information is likely to be shared with these companies.
            We will request that these companies maintain the privacy of the
            registrants’ information.<br>

            companies within the Armstrong family of companies.</p>
            <p>We use outside shipping companies to ship all commercial orders,

            from us, we will share your personally-identifiable information with
            these companies to fulfill your order. We will also share our
            commercial customers’ Federal Express and UPS account numbers with
            these companies in order to fulfill commercial orders.</p>
            <p>An outside company responds to consumer and commercial requests
            for additional information about our products. We will share your
            personally-identifiable information with any such company in order

            <p>3. Non Personally-Identifiable Information: What We Collect</p>
            </u></b>
            <p>We collect and use non-personally identifiable information about
            you in the following ways:</p>
            <u>
            <p>Cookies</p>

            <p>At certain points in your visit to the Armstrong site, our server
            may send a "cookie" file to your computer. Your Web
            browser may prompt you to accept this file unless you have set your
            browser preferences to accept all cookies automatically. Cookies are
            employed primarily as a service to our customers, to extend the
            relevance and responsiveness of the Armstrong site. We may link
            cookie information with any personally-identifiable information you
            provide us. Cookie files are discarded at the end of each session on
            our site.<u><br>
            <br>
            Other Non-Personally-Identifiable Information</u></p><u>
            </u>
            <p>The Armstrong Web site may collect non-personally
            identifiable information during your visit, such as type of browser,
            operating system, domain name, or IP address. An IP address is a
            number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever
            you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that
            "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your
            computer by its IP address. When you visit pages on Armstrong's Web
            site our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to
            any personally identifiable information. This means that your
            session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. IP address
            information is used only to improve the service of the Armstrong
            site, and is then discarded at the end of each session on our site.</p>
            <font size="2">
            </font><p><font size="2"></font>Armstrong also collects information through
            "referrers" and various environmental variables. A
            "referrer" is information the Web browser passes along to
            Armstrong’s Web server that references the URL from which you
            came. "Environmental variables" include, among other
            things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you
            accessed our Web site, type of Web browser and operating system or
            platform used, the Internet address of the Web site you left to
            visit Armstrong, the names of the pages you visit while at our Web
            site, and the Internet address of the Web site you then visit. We
            collect all of this information to allow us to detect broad
            demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your
            interests and to enhance your experience on Armstrong’s Web site.
            Armstrong may store "referrer" information for a limited
            period of time prior to deleting this information.</p>

            <p>Profiling</p>

            effort to provide you with information and offers that are of
            interest to you, we may merge your personally-identifiable
            information with click-stream data and other data we have (including
            cookies and offline data). We will provide notice of this, as well
            as an opportunity to opt-out of it, at the time and place of
            information collection and before data is entered on our system.</p>
