<p><a name="children"><b><font size="2">Children Under 13:</font></b></a><br>
  <font size="2">ACG cares about the safety of children. Since our content and services 
  are not directed towards kids, children under 13 are not allowed to register 
  with our website or to participate in public posting areas on our site. As a 
  reminder, children should always get permission from their parents before sending 
  any information about themselves (such as their names, e-mail addresses, and 
  phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. </font></p>
  <p><a name="collectinfo"><b><font size="2">Information We Collect:</font></b></a><br>
    <font size="2">Generally, the information we gather on our website falls into 
    two categories: (1) information you supply when you register, sign up for 
    our product offerings, participate in sweepstakes, contests, surveys and promotions, 
    or send us correspondence, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate 
    through our site. Third-party providers featured on or linked to our website, 
    such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may gather 
    the same kinds of information about you. </font> </p>
<blockquote><font size="2"><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
  To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, 
  we collect personally identifiable information about you including your name, 
  e-mail address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional 
  information, such as birth date, content interests, and the like, but you're 
  free to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, 
  we may ask you for personal information when you sign up for products and/or 
  services, complete a survey, or report a problem with our site. Generally, we 
  use this information to communicate with you, process your orders and to help 
  improve our site.</font> 
  <p><font size="2">From time to time, we also may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself (such as name, address, and e-mail address). Generally, we use this information to verify eligibility and to notify winners. We may share this information with co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always identify that another party is involved. We don't control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use the information before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in the promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the contest or promotion. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><u>Aggregate Information</u><br>
      To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store and sometimes 
      track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent 
      to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
      The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your 
      browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. 
      However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage 
      of various features on our site that are available to other visitors. Occasionally, 
      in the course of serving advertisements to our site, advertisers or our 
      third-party advertiser may place or recognize cookies on your browser. ACG 
      does not control and is not responsible for these cookies. Information about 
      your visits to our site, such as the number of times you have viewed an 
      ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to 
      serve ads to you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">When you use our site, we may also collect your browser type, access time, and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records of this information. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information identifies you personally either; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of the advertising on our website. </font></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="infoweuse"><b><font size="2">How Your Information Will Be Used:</font></b></a><br><font size="2">Among our primary goals in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our site more valuable to you. We try to ensure that the banner advertisements we deliver to you are consistent with your interests. We may also e-mail you with messages and advertising that we think may be of interest to you. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">To make your online experience more useful and enjoyable, our site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary to provide the products or services. We will not provide your e-mail address to such third parties unless it's necessary to provide services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion. We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy and practices of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy and practices of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on our site throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy and practices may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">We may disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure 
  is (i) required by law or necessary for compliance with legal process, or necessary, 
  in our good faith belief, in order to conform with the edicts of the law or 
  comply with legal process; (ii) necessary to enforce our other agreements between 
  you and us; (iii) necessary to protect the rights, safety or interests of other 
  visitors and members of our site or other members of the public; and/or (iv) 
  necessary to protect the rights or interests of ACG or its partners, sponsors 
  or affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In 
  the event that ACG or our assets or our site (or a significant portion thereof) 
  is acquired by another company, information on our visitors and members would 
  be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose aggregate information 
  to companies that provide us with financing, technology, and corporate, financial 
  and legal advice, as well as to our partners and visitors. You acknowledge and 
  agree to disclosure in each of the foregoing circumstances. </font></p>
<p><a name="correctinfo"><b><font size="2">How to correct or update your information:</font></b></a><br><font size="2">ACG believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us.</font></p>
  <p><a name="opt-out"><b><font size="2">Opt-Out Information:</font></b></a><br>
    <font size="2">You may opt-out of receiving information from us at any time 
    simply by updating your preferences. </font> </p>

    ACG currently has no newsletter preferences.</font> 
    <p><font size="2"><u>Promotional Emails:</u><br>
      ACG currently has no promotional email preferences.</font> 
    </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="security"><b><font size="2">Security and Passwords:</font></b></a><br><font size="2">The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide procedures such as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or e-mail address, for example, make sure not to include it in any message you post publicly. <br><br><b>Unauthorized Use/Hacking:</b><br>ACG's website and system are made available for lawful activities by authorized users only. Any person using the site without authority or for any unlawful activity are subject to having his or her activities monitored, recorded, investigated, examined and/or disclosed by or to ACG and its agents, and law enforcement. ACG may also monitor and record the activities of authorized users. Any information so recorded may be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy. </font></p>
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="misc"><b><font size="2">Miscellaneous:</font></b></a><br><font size="2">The Internet is an evolving medium. Accordingly, ACG reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. If we need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes or an amended Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the site or any of the services offered therein following any such posting will constitute your acceptance of all changes. In addition, by visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Please read both carefully before using or registering with any of our sites. </font></font></p>
