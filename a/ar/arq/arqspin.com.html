<h1>Arqball LLC Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We at Arqball LLC have a firm commitment to safeguarding your privacy.  This page will inform you about our information gathering and dissemination practices.  When we refer to "Arqball", we are referring to this website and to Arqball LLC and its affiliates. Welcome to our website.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT CAREFULLY. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any personal information you share with us through this website. This privacy policy statement ("Privacy Policy") explains how we collect personal information about you through this website and how this information is then used or disclosed. It does not apply to our websites that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or that have their own Privacy Policy or to information we may collect from you or about you in other ways, including through emails you may send to us. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party.</p>

<p>Generally, we gather information about you to provide you with convenient access to certain features and services and to verify your identity in our interactions with you, to deliver a better customer service experience, to administer our business, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy and on our website. For example, before you may submit any content to our website, we ask that you create an account and sign in with a login name and password. If you choose not to provide us with the requested information, you will not be able to submit any material to our website or use our services because we cannot verify your identity.</p>

<p>We hope that this Privacy Policy will remove any concerns you may have about supplying us with information and make visiting this website a rewarding and safe experience. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion by posting the updated terms on this website. You are responsible for periodically reading this Privacy Policy. Your continued usage of this website and our services after we have updated this Privacy Policy means you have read the updated terms and agree with such changes. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any person.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>"Personally Identifiable Information"</em> means information that can identify or be traced to an individual person, such as your name, date and place of birth, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, and credit card number.</li>
  <li><em>"Non-Personal Information"</em> means information that cannot, without further information, be traced to an individual person, such as the aggregation of information such as the total number of users over a certain age or geographic location.</li>
  <li><em>"Information"</em> means Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personal Information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How it is Used</h2>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our website may include: (i) your name, address, contact information such as email address and phone number, age, gender, country of residence, and user profile, which we use for account administration and communications purposes; (ii) financial and payment information for fulfilling purchases; (iii) a username, which can be your real name or an alias, to track your activities on our website, for administrative purposes and to communicate with you; and (iv) a network address used to identify your personal computer.</p>

<p>You can access most portions of the website without entering Personally Identifiable Information and without expressly having to give consent to any specific question (beyond complying with the Terms and Conditions of the website).  We do not collect any Personally Identifiable information about you through this website unless you choose to provide it to us voluntarily.</p>

<p>"Opting-In" is the process by which you expressly indicate that you want to participate in our service or one of its features or options.  Generally, we use Personally Identifiable Information to respond to, process, and fulfill your requests, and update you on status.  To submit material to the website and use our services, you will be asked to create an account with us. To Opt-In to our service, you would click the Create Account button which can be accessed via the Sign In link in the upper left hand corner of your screen.  If you create an account with us, you will be asked to enter your name, billing and shipping address, phone number, and email address.  If you want to obtain our paid services, we require that you provide payment information such as a bank account or credit card information, and other information as required by our third party processors.</p>

<p>"Opting-Out" is the process by which you expressly indicate that you decline to receive newsletters and other communications from us, excluding email concerning your account.  To discontinue your receipt of such newsletters and communications, you can do so in the "Account Settings" portion of the "My Account" section of the website or you can send an email with your request to <a href="mailto:support@arqball.com">support@arqball.com</a>.</p>  

<p>If you do provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected or in this Privacy Policy. We may also use your postal mail or email address or phone number to send you further information about Arqball, or to contact you for the purposes of research, product development, or customer service. We may also aggregate personal and other information about you collected from this website with other information you provide us through interactions with you through the telephone or otherwise.  If you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that screen or page.</p>

<p>Arqball will not sell, license, transmit or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties unless: (1) you expressly authorize us to do so; (2) it is necessary to enable third-party providers of products and services available on this website to respond to, process and fulfill your requests; (3) it is necessary to allow our trusted service providers or agents to provide services for us; (4) we do so in order to provide our products or services to you; (5) it is in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Arqball or the merger of Arqball into another entity or any consolidation, share exchange, combination, reorganization, or like transaction in which Arqball is not the survivor; (6) as otherwise required or permitted by law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (7) we reasonably determine that it is necessary in order to protect the rights, property, or safety of Arqball, its users, or the public.</p>

<p>We will not disclose your personal information to a third party for their direct marketing purposes unless you first affirmatively agree to the disclosure.</p>

Such information includes Internet Protocol addresses, web browser type, host or service provider, referring or exit pages, operating system, and date and time stamps.</p>

<p>And, as is true of most websites, we use Cookies and Web Beacons (both defined and described below) to collect or store Non-Personal Information about your use of our website.  "Cookies" are a random and anonymous number assigned to visitors or websites.  This file holds information such as how many times visitors are accessing our website, information concerning purchases or requests, validation information for members-only sections, and which sections of the website are most popular.

<p>We may occasionally use other companies to set Cookies on our website and gather Cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers or process credit card purchases for our website. We use the Cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above.  In some cases, we retain both the Cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online – for example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical records of your past transactions. In other cases, we only retain the Cookie and/or online information you give us at your request for your use in subsequent sessions.</p>
