<p><strong>Your Information on ArrowOutlet</strong><br> <br> Once you have been approved as registered user with ArrowOutlet, you will be required to choose a user name.

<p><strong>Revoking Consent/Deleting Your Account</strong><br> <br> Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law.

<p><strong>The Use of Cookies at our Website</strong><br> <br> ArrowOutlet uses so-called “cookies”, which are files that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in customizing your experience with the online service. The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for example by keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of “pop-up” windows. You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your hard drive by adjusting the corresponding settings in your browser. However, we would like to point out that turning off these settings may result in limited functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Security Measures</strong><br> <br> Your ArrowOutlet account and profile and the information contained therein are password protected. Please note that you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else. ArrowOutlet will never ask for your password in e-mails that you receive unexpectedly or that you did not request. Please remember to log out of your account and to close your internet browser window when you leave the ArrowOutlet site; this is especially important if you use a PC in public locations. At present, this is the safest way to ensure that no one has access to your personal information. We assume no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used.&nbsp;<br> Further, We treat data as an asset that must be protected. We use lots of security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
<p><strong>Protection from Web Crawlers or Spam</strong><br> <br> ArrowOutlet assures you that we will use your e-mail address with your express consent only for the purposes stated in the Terms of Use. We will not rent or sell your e-mail address to third parties, and we will prevent your e-mail address from being recorded by “web crawlers” or “web spiders” to the best of our ability. If you believe that your e-mail address has been recorded in this way, please let us know immediately.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong><br> <br> We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 10 days after they are initially posted on the site.</p>
