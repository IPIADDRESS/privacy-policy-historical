<h3>Connecting To Social Media</h3>

<h3>Testimonials</h3>
We post testimonials on our Sites. Testimonials may contain Personally Identifiable Information. We will obtain your consent via email prior to posting the testimonial or comment.
<h2>Do we use cookies?</h2>
Yes. Cookies are small files that sites and service providers may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser. They enable the site and service provider systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. You can turn off cookies in your settings at any time.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
We may use Cookies to provide a targeted advertising experience on and off our site.
<h2>Do we use Web beacons or Pixels?</h2>
Yes. We and our Partners employ a software technology that helps us better manage content on our site. Web beacons or Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. They track your online Web movement. We embed Pixels invisibly on Web pages. They are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.

Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our partners’ Pixels. We also have no control over how they use information collected.
<h2>Do we collect software information?</h2>
Yes. We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed. We use your registry information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with software already present on your PC. We do not tie registry information gathered to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.
<h2>Do we collect hardware information?</h2>
Yes. Your computer’s operating system also stores hardware information that we examine to determine your computer’s hardware configuration including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as well as the speed of your processor. We use the information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with your computer hardware. We do not tie hardware information to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.
<h2>Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or other’s rights, property, or safety.

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
<h3>Multi-site Advertising</h3>
We have online Behavioral Advertising on our Site.

Advertisers and advertising networks use tracking technologies to collect information about users’ computers or mobile devices and their online activities (for example, web pages visited and searches made) as well as general geographic location and use that information to display targeted ads to users. We sometimes allow these ad companies to collect such information when you use our sites and apps to enable them to display targeted ads to you on and off our Site.

Many ad companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative. NAI members allow users to opt out of being tracked by cookies. To opt out of cookie tracking by NAI members, you may visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> and click on the “Consumer Opt-out” button. Companies may also be members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and to opt out of cookie tracking by DAA members, you may visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
<h3>Third party links</h3>
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
<h2>How Do Toolbars Affect Your Browser And Operating System?</h2>
Toolbars install into your Internet browser and allow you to search the Internet. If you consent to make a toolbar your default search, your Internet browser default search feature will be set and you will access search services (i) by entering queries in your browser search box; (ii) by entering queries in your browser address bar, and/or (iii) in response to misspelled, incorrectly formatted or unresolved DNS submissions in your browser address bar.

Toolbars do not affect your operating system. Toolbars can be removed at any time. For more information regarding toolbars, please view our <a href="/terms-of-service/" target="blank">Terms of Service</a>.
