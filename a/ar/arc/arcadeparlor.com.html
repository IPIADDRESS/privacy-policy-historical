<div class="static_wrapper"><div class="static_top"></div><div class="static_title"><span class="static_bg"></span>Privacy Policy</div><div class="static_content"><!--- livepreview !--><p>ArcadeParlor PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information ArcadeParlor (referred to herein as "ArcadeParlor", "Company", "we", “us”, or “our”) collects from individuals who visit www.ArcadeParlor.com (the "Site"), download the Software (as defined below) and/or participate in the services offered by ArcadeParlor as described herein ("User(s)" or "you"). Please take a moment to review this Privacy Policy, which explains how we use and maintain that information. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not visit the Site, download the Software and/or participate in the resources offered by ArcadeParlor.</p>
<p><strong>Overview and Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site and Software.</p>
<p>We collect two kinds of information through the Site. The first kind is information that can identify you as a specific individual - such as your name and email address (“Personally Identifiable Information” or "PII"). We only collect PII when you have contacted us directly. (See "Collection of Personally Identifiable Information" below). The second kind of information is the kind of non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") collected and stored automatically by many websites. It may include, for example, information about your Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser, geographic location, and pages viewed on the Site. Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your PII and cannot be linked to you personally.</p>
<p>“Games” include engaging arcade, puzzle, strategy and other video games that are provided free of charge on the Site. Games are offered free of charge via emails sent to you when you sign up on the Site (“Emails”). You can also elect to access Games via push notifications if you agree to receive such push notifications by the Site (“Push Notifications”). In addition, you can download and install the ArcadeParlor software or add-on/extension from the Site (collectively, the "Software"). The Software allows us to display third party applications as well as text link, popup/under, new tab, transitional, shopping and/or banner advertisements based on the web content viewed by that User. No PII is collected through the Software. In addition, the Site and Games may display advertisements from third parties before and/or during gameplay. All third party applications and all advertisements from the Software, Site and Games shall collectively be known as “Third Party Content”.</p>
<p>Your dealings with Third Party Content, including, but not limited to, your interaction with its advertisements and promotions, your clicking on links provided by Third Party Content, purchase of its goods, or any other type of involvement, are solely between you and the third party. Therefore we do not endorse the advertisements, products or other materials of the Third Party Content. If you interact with the Third Party Content, their terms and conditions and privacy policies apply to your rights and obligations with respect to such interaction. Accordingly, such third parties may collect PII or NPII about you.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>PII is collected by ArcadeParlor only when you provide it to us via signing up for Emails on the Site and/or the <a href="http://www.arcadeparlor.com/contact">Contact Us</a> page, in which the Site asks for your name and email address so that you can receive a response to any questions you may have.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through the Site feature described above. By providing us with your PII using this feature, you are authorizing our use and sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we may publish on the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
<p>If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or remove it by emailing our Customer Support at&nbsp;<script> document.write(baseFunctions.Base64.decode('PGEgaHJlZj0ibWFpbHRvOnN1cHBvcnRAYXJjYWRlcGFybG9yLmNvbSIgdGFyZ2V0PSJfdG9wIj5zdXBwb3J0QGFyY2FkZXBhcmxvci5jb208L2E+'));</script><a href="mailto:support@arcadeparlor.com" target="_top">support@arcadeparlor.com</a>&nbsp;or by contacting us using our <a href="http://www.arcadeparlor.com/contact">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. In addition, we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media (Features) and Widgets:</strong></p>
<p>The Site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Our Site and Software are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PII we will take steps to remove such information.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; and/or (3) as otherwise stated in this Policy.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. We may share your PII with our principals, employees, consultants, officers, directors, members, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, or our parent company and its principals, parent company, employees, officers, consultants, directors, members, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates (collectively “Related Companies”). Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.</p>
<p>We and our Related Companies may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to comply with a court order, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, Emails, Push Notifications or Software, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users or the public.</p>
<p>We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Companies may work with outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist in distributing Emails or Push Notifications; (c) assist with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone; and/or (g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site, Emails, Push Notifications and Software. We and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep confidential all information we share with them, and use the information only to perform their obligations to us.</p>
<p>In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the ArcadeParlor home page of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>As with many websites, when you visit the Site, it automatically gathers certain NPII based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at the Site, to help us improve the quality of the Site and to make your visits easy, convenient and fun. ArcadeParlor also collects your IP address to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to the general collection of NPII by the Site (including, but not limited to, IP address, browser type, operating system version, time and date stamp, and landing page), the Software may collect your IP addresses, browser information, operating system information, URLs, HTML, the content of web pages you visit and/or information about your computer, such as installed programs and running processes/services. We may use this NPII to assist us in delivering to you more relevant content in the form of Third Party Content, which appears when you are online generally. We may also work with third party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver such Third Party Content to you. We may share your NPII and/or aggregated information with our third party partners to improve the relevancy of such Third Party Content and/or to provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. These third party partners, including, but not limited to, advertising networks and advertisers, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect and track NPII such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist them in delivering Third Party Content that is more relevant to your interests. They may also utilize supplemental data from other sources and analytics methods to help deliver more relevant Third Party Content. However, if at any time, you would like to permanently stop receiving all Third Party Content, you should uninstall the Software, unsubscribe from the Emails and do not use the Site (including via Push Notifications). The directions for uninstalling the Software and disabling Push Notifications are set forth below in the section entitled "Removal."</p>
<p>You can opt-out of the use of your NPII from being used by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members. The NAI opt-out tool was developed in conjunction with NAI members for the express purpose of allowing consumers to "opt-out" of the behavioral advertising delivered by NAI members. If you opt-out of the use of your NPII from being used by NAI members, you will continue to receive ads, however, it will prevent NAI members from delivering ads tailored to your preferences and usage patterns. If you opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising (as defined <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it">here</a>) by one or more NAI member company, that choice will be stored in “opt-out cookies.” If you ever delete opt-out cookies from your browser (such as by clearing all cookies), buy a new computer, or change web browsers, you'll need to renew your opt-out choices. NAI member companies need to be able to read an "opt-out" cookie on your browser to know not to collect and use data for interest-based advertising purposes. For more information or to opt-out click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</p>
