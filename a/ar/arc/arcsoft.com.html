<div class="general-div">
<p>Your privacy is important to ArcSoft. We've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. This Privacy Policy governs your use of the ArcSoft web site at www.arcsoft.com, and all associated sites linked to www.arcsoft.com by ArcSoft, its agents and affiliates, including ArcSoft sites around the world (collectively, "Site") and all other services provided to you by ArcSoft (collectively, "Service").
