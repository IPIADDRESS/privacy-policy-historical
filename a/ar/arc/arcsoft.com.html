         <p>Your privacy is important, so ArcSoft has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect 
         when you visit our website, why we collect such information and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data 
         collection and use practices of the ArcSoft website at www.arcsoft.com; it does not apply to other online or offline ArcSoft 
         websites, products or services of ArcSoft including, but not limited to, www.photoisland.com, or the Chinese, or Japanese 
         versions of the www.arcsoft.com website. Any software downloaded or purchased from this website is governed by the privacy 
         terms set forth in the license agreement for such product and not this Privacy Policy.  The terms "you," 
         "your," "users," and "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our website.  The 
         terms "ArcSoft," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ArcSoft.  By using this website, 
         you consent to the data practices prescribed in this statement.  We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy 
         that we will include on this page.  It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed 
         about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.</p>
         <p><b>A.	INFORMATION COLLECTED </b><br>
         ArcSoft collects Personal Information (as defined below) from you and also automatically receives and records information 
         on its server logs from your browser, which may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, cookie information and the 
         page you request. We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first 
         and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work 
         or at home, to be "Personal Information."  When a user interacts with ArcSoft's website, ArcSoft's servers keep 
         an activity log unique to that end user that collects the following non-identifiable information: source IP address, time of 
         access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, and type of browser used.  In general, you can visit this 
         website without telling us who you are and without revealing any Personal Information about yourself.  We do not collect 
         Personal Information about you on this website unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
         <p><b>B.	MEANS OF COLLECTION</b><br>
         ArcSoft may automatically receive certain aggregate data as discussed above and will receive Personal Information about 
         you where you provide such information through this website or other communications/interactions with ArcSoft.  In terms 
         of your online purchases, ArcSoft uses the third-party e-commerce service provider, Element 5, to manage its online store 
         and the transactions related to that service.  When you enter the ArcSoft online store, it looks like you are still on 
         the ArcSoft website, but in actuality you are transferred to a secure site operated by Element 5 who processes your order 
         and delivers the product to you on ArcSoft's behalf.  In the future, we may engage the services of other third-party 
         e-commerce service providers, in which case we will notify you through this Privacy Policy.  ArcSoft will have access to 
         any information you provide to such third-party e-commerce service provider so that it can meet certain business requirements 
         as well as provide you with promotional offers and information regarding ArcSoft and its products.  All purchases made 
         through the third party e-commerce service provider are secure and are governed by that provider's own privacy policy and 
         not this Privacy Policy.  If you have questions about Element 5's information practices, please read its privacy policy at: 
         <a href="http://www.element5.com/privacy.html?sessionid=47152107&amp;random=bf718f11cd5d0">http://www.element5.com/privacy.html?sessionid=47152107&amp;random=bf718f11cd5d0</a>
         You always have the right to choose whether or not to provide information about yourself to ArcSoft.  If you choose not to 
         provide such information, you can still use this website but you may not be able to access certain options, offers or 
         services.</p>
         <p><b>C.	INFORMATION USE</b><br>
         ArcSoft uses the Personal Information it collects from you to provide you with information regarding our products and

         website and the programs, products and services offered on it.  Personal Information disclosed through our product 
         registration process will not only be used as set forth above but also to establish your ownership rights in the software
