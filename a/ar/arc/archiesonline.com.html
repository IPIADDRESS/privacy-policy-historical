         privacy is not a new endeavor for ARCHIESONLINE.COM. ARCHIESONLINE.COM 
         has a long-standing tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy 
         of customers who use its telecommunication networks. The company maintains 
         strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art 
         technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from 
         unauthorized intrusions. ARCHIESONLINE.COM recognizing the growth of online 
         services, including Internet services, has created additional privacy 
         concerns, particularly for consumers. Online privacy concerns focus on 
         the protection of "customer identifiable" information, which an individual 
         or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, 
         "customer identifiable" information is information which can be associated 
         with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's 
         name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about 
         online activities that are directly linked to them. It is common practice 
         and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations 
         to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business 
         and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect 
         customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, 
         and a variety of other information in the course of billing and providing 
         telephone service to a customer. Some activities on the Internet follow 
         very familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an Internet access service, 
         for example, are usually asked to provide name, address, telephone number 
         and credit card and other information that is typical when the consumer 
         orders a product or service. Similarly, business web sites may ask visitors 
         to supply information about themselves, particularly when information, 
         services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to 
         better target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.&nbsp;<br>
         <br>
         ARCHIESONLINE.COM is committed to safeguard your privacy online. Please 
         read the following policy to understand how your personal information 
         will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy 
         may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Read about 
         how ARCHIESONLINE.COM treats the privacy of all its customers and in particular 
         about vulnerable children.</font></p>

             ARCHIESONLINE.COM collects information in several ways from different 
             parts of our network of web sites. Information is gathered when you 
             register. During registration ARCHIESONLINE.COM asks for your name, 
             e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry 
             and personal interests and other specified information. This is sought 
             from you voluntarily, as ARCHIESONLINE.COM would be better able to 
             customize your experience. Thus the more precise and accurate the 
             information provided, the better the service that you get from ARCHIESONLINE.COM. 
             On registration, ARCHIESONLINE.COM gives you an ID and you are then 
             able to take the best advantage of all of Archie's many offerings. 
             However, in addition to registration, ARCHIESONLINE.COM would also 
             ask you for personal information at other times, including, (but not 
             limited to), when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored 
             by ARCHIESONLINE.COM and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase 
             using ARCHIESONLINE.COM Shopping; when you post a ARCHIESONLINE.COM 
             Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when 
             you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact 
             ARCHIESONLINE.COM we may keep a record of that correspondence. ARCHIESONLINE.COM 
             also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research 
             purposes. Wherever ARCHIESONLINE.COM collects personal information 
             we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that 
             page.<br>

             does ARCHIESONLINE.COM use my information?</b><br>
             ARCHIESONLINE.COM’ primary goal in collecting personal information 
             is to provide you, with a customized and personalized experience on 
             our network of sites, which includes interactive communications, online 
             shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely 
             free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display 
             advertisements. By knowing a little about you, ARCHIESONLINE.COM is 
             able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence 
             better service, to you. In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, 
             ARCHIESONLINE.COM plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement 
             and tell us the type of audience they want to reach, (for example, 
             males over 35 years old). ARCHIESONLINE.COM takes the advertisement 
             and displays it to users meeting those criteria. In this process, 
             the advertiser never has access to individual account information. 
             Only ARCHIESONLINE.COM has access to individual’s accounts. This kind 
             of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional 
             e-mail through which ARCHIESONLINE.COM delivers. Only special offers 
             would be sent by via e-mail from ARCHIESONLINE.COM and only if you 
             have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to 
             receive them. You can always change your account preferences at any 
             time. ARCHIESONLINE.COM does research on our users' demographics, 
             interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon 
             registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from 
             surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This 
             research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. ARCHIESONLINE.COM
