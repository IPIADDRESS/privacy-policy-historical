ARCHIESONLINE.COM has a long-standing tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy of customers who use its telecommunication networks. The company maintains strict customer information privacy policies and uses state of the art technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from unauthorized intrusions. ARCHIESONLINE.COM recognizing the growth of online services, including Internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly for consumers. Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer identifiable" information, which an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about online activities that are directly linked to them. It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety of other information in the course of billing and providing telephone service to a customer. Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an Internet access service, for example, are usually asked to provide name, address, telephone number and credit card and other information that is typical when the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, business web sites may ask visitors to supply information about themselves, particularly when information, services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.&nbsp;<br>
         <br>
         ARCHIESONLINE.COM is committed to safeguard your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically.

             ARCHIESONLINE.COM collects information in several ways from different parts of our network of web sites. Information is gathered when you register. During registration ARCHIESONLINE.COM asks for your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests and other specified information. This is sought from you voluntarily, as ARCHIESONLINE.COM would be better able to customize your experience. Thus the more precise and accurate the information provided, the better the service that you get from ARCHIESONLINE.COM. On registration, ARCHIESONLINE.COM gives you an ID and you are then able to take the best advantage of all of Archie's many offerings. However, in addition to registration, ARCHIESONLINE.COM would also ask you for personal information at other times, including, (but not limited to), when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by ARCHIESONLINE.COM and/or our many partners; when you make a purchase using ARCHIESONLINE.COM Shopping; when you post a ARCHIESONLINE.COM Classified ad; when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. If you contact ARCHIESONLINE.COM we may keep a record of that correspondence. ARCHIESONLINE.COM also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever ARCHIESONLINE.COM collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.<br>

             ARCHIESONLINE.COM’ primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, with a customized and personalized experience on our network of sites, which includes interactive communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, ARCHIESONLINE.COM is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, ARCHIESONLINE.COM plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach, (for example, males over 35 years old). ARCHIESONLINE.COM takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only ARCHIESONLINE.COM has access to individual’s accounts. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional e-mail through which ARCHIESONLINE.COM delivers. Only special offers would be sent by via e-mail from ARCHIESONLINE.COM and only if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to receive them. You can always change your account preferences at any time. ARCHIESONLINE.COM does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. ARCHIESONLINE.COM may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.<br>

             When you are on an ARCHIESONLINE.COM site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with ARCHIESONLINE.COM alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However, where services are offered in conjunction with other partner merchants, for providing co-branded service to you, it would be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner merchant. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than ARCHIESONLINE.COM, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. Promotions that run on ARCHIESONLINE.COM may be sponsored by companies other than ARCHIESONLINE.COM or may be co-sponsored by ARCHIESONLINE.COM and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data is shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most ARCHIESONLINE.COM promotions are limited to Indian residents. Please be aware that ARCHIESONLINE.COM Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.
