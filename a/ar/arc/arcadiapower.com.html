      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a small file that may be stored on your computer or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
      <p>Web beacons and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, ads, and e-mail, that communicate with third parties.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Other Technologies</h2>

We may include web beacons in e-mails, for example, to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</li>
        <li>Storing your sign-in credentials and preferences so that you don’t have to enter those credentials and preferences each time you log on to a Site.</li>
