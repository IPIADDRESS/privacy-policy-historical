                  <p><b>Our Privacy Philosophy.</b></p>
                  <p>We at Archie Comics 


Entertainment

 are determined to ensure that 
                    our visitors, customers and friends will have a fun experience 
                    while visiting this Website, without sacrificing their peace 
                    of mind as to the protection of their identity and other personal 
                    information. This policy statement tells you how we collect 
                    information on you, how it's used, and the steps we are taking 
                    to protect it from any unauthorized use.</p>
                  <p><b>Children's Online Privacy.</b></p>
                  <p>Because many visitors to this site are children, we take 
                    the utmost care to make certain that our content is appropriate 
                    for kids of all ages. We do not ask children to disclose more 
                    personal information than is necessary for them to participate 
                    in a particular activity (eg: normally just their e-mail address), 
                    and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact 
                    information. Children should obtain permission from a parent 
                    or guardian before contacting Archie Comics Entertainment in any 
                    regard, especially before entering any personal information 
                    (which we expressly discourage) or requesting information. 
                    Archie Comics Entertainment does not permit children under the age 
                    of 13 to place any orders at the Stuff Shop, or communicate 
                    with us through this Website without the express written permission 
                    of their Parent or Legal Guardian. If Archie Comics Entertainment 
                    has any reason to believe that a visitor under the age of 
                    13 is posting information, or attempting to purchase merchandise 
                    from our Stuff Shop, they will be asked to have their Parent 
                    or Legal Guardian send an e-mail or fax to us to confirm authorization.</p>
                  <p>Archie does not solicit personally identifiable information 
                    from children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
                    ("COPPA") requires Websites that cater to children 
                    - or know that a visitor to their site is a child under the 
                    age of 13 - to follow specific Federal Trade Commission rules. 
                    In our attempt to fully comply with these rules, we would 
                    like you to know that:</p>
                  <p>** Personally identifiable offline contact information will 
                    not be collected without prior parental consent.</p>
                  <p>** Personal online contact information will not be solicited 
                    and collected without prior parental consent or parental notification, 
                    which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent 
                    use of the information and the child's participation in the 
                    activity. </p>
                  <p>** Without prior parental consent, online information will 
                    only be used to respond directly to the child's request for 
                    information and will not be used for other purposes.</p>
                  <p>** Archie Comics Entertainment will not entice any child or adult, 
                    regardless of their age, to divulge more personal information 
                    than is needed to use the site or participate in any online 
                    activity by offering any special game, prize, incentive or 
                    other similar activity.</p>
                  <p>** In no case will any personally identifiable information 
                    be distributed to third parties or otherwise posted, EXCEPT 
                    in the event of a Business Transfer, Merger, or Buyout of 
                    Archie Comics Entertainment (see below for more details).</p>
                  <p><b>Information Collection and Use.</b></p>
                  <p>** Archie Comics Entertainment uses the limited information it collects 
                    from visitors, if any, for internal research, and may use 
                    this information to customize the advertising and content 
                    seen on our pages. </p>
                  <p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>.</p>
                  <p>** Archie Comics Entertainment will not contact children under 13 
                    about special offers or for marketing purposes without parental 
                    consent.<br>
                    <br>
                    **Archie Comics Entertainment will not send personally identifiable 
                    information about a child to other companies or people, UNLESS 
                    we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal 
                    process - to the extent permitted by law.</p>
                  <p><b>Ability to Update or Delete Information. </b></p>
                  <p>** Parents or Legal Guardians are welcome to send an e-mail 
                    to <a href="mailto:help@archiecomics.com">help@archiecomics.com</a> 
                    to request deletion of any information we may have on their 
                    child.</p>
                  <p>** Please note that information about a child may remain 
                    in back-up storage for some period of time after a request 
                    for deletion of that child's account. This may be the case 
                    even though no information about that account remains in our 
                    active user databases.</p>
                  <p><b>Archie Comics Entertainment's Use of 'Cookies'.</b></p>
                  <p>To enable many of the features available on our Website, 
                    we may assign cookies to your Internet browser. This unique 
                    identification number automatically identifies your browser 
                    (but not you) to our computers whenever you interact with 
                    one of our Internet domain names. When you visit our site, 
                    a cookie in effect says to our server computers "Hello, 
                    I'm browser #6426, what do you do just for me?" Only 
                    if you agree to provide information on yourself, which we 
                    normally discourage, would we be able to know anything about 
                    you other than the random number that our server computers 
                    assign to your browser in the first place. Cookies assist 
                    you, by assisting us in creating a record of your unique preferences. 
                    Archie Comics Entertainment would only use cookies to determine how 
                    many visitors we have and how often they have visited particular 
                    pages on this site. We would not use cookies to indirectly 
                    obtain a personal profile on individual visitors, as some 
                    Website Operators choose to do through the assistance of profiling 
                    software.</p>
                  <p>Many people are confused about cookies, how they are used, 
                    and what they can do. Cookies are very small text files written 
                    by an Internet server to a customer's browser when information 
                    is exchanged. Cookies only contain information that the server 
                    computer "knew" in the first place and can only 
                    be read by the serving domain that placed them. Cookies are 
                    an essential part of how the Internet works today and allow 
                    servers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. 
                    If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides 
                    personalized content to you without requiring that you "log 
                    in," this is accomplished through the use of cookies. 
                    Since cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" 
                    on your computer and have no ability to search your computer 
                    for other information or transmit it to anyone. Cookies are 
                    implemented as part of the technology implemented by your 
                    web browser. </p>
                  <p><b>The Stuff Shop.</b></p>
                  <p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from the 
                    Stuff Shop will be required to provide their full name, billing 
                    and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and 
                    a credit card number. If the order is being shipped to a third 
                    party, we will also need the recipient's name and mailing 
                    address. Before collecting information in connection with 
                    a Stuff Shop order, we will verify the validity of the purchaser's 
                    credit card. On a rare occasion, we might solicit additional 
                    voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping 
                    preferences. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from 
                    ordering anything at all from our Stuff Shop without the express 
                    written permission of their Parent or Legal Guardian.</p>
                  <p><b>Business Transfer.</b> </p>
                  <p>In the event that Archie Comic Online or substantially all 
                    of its assets are acquired by a third party, customer information 
                    will be one of the transferred assets. However, use of any 
                    information collected on children under the age of 13, if 
                    among the transferred assets should such a transaction take 
                    place, will only be used in accordance with the policies set 
                    forth herein in compliance with COPPA.</p>
