<p><b>Our Privacy Philosophy.</b></p>

<p>We at Archie Comics are determined to ensure that 
our visitors, customers and friends will have a fun experience 
while visiting this Website, without sacrificing their peace 
of mind as to the protection of their identity and other personal 
information. This policy statement tells you how we collect 
information on you, how it's used, and the steps we are taking 
to protect it from any unauthorized use.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Children's Online Privacy.</b></p>
<p>Because many visitors to this site are children, we take 
the utmost care to make certain that our content is appropriate 
for kids of all ages. We do not ask children to disclose more 
personal information than is necessary for them to participate 
in a particular activity (eg: normally just their e-mail address), 
and we take steps to prevent children from posting contact 
information. Children should obtain permission from a parent 
or guardian before contacting Archie Comics in any 
regard, especially before entering any personal information 
(which we expressly discourage) or requesting information. 
Archie Comics does not permit children under the age 
of 13 to place any orders at the Stuff Shop, or communicate 
with us through this Website without the express written permission 
of their Parent or Legal Guardian. If Archie Comics 
has any reason to believe that a visitor under the age of 
13 is posting information, or attempting to purchase merchandise 
from our Stuff Shop, they will be asked to have their Parent 
or Legal Guardian send an e-mail or fax to us to confirm authorization.</p>
<p>Archie does not solicit personally identifiable information 
from children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
("COPPA") requires Websites that cater to children 
- or know that a visitor to their site is a child under the 
age of 13 - to follow specific Federal Trade Commission rules. 
In our attempt to fully comply with these rules, we would 
like you to know that:</p>
<p>** Personally identifiable offline contact information will 
not be collected without prior parental consent.</p>

<p>** Personal online contact information will not be solicited 
and collected without prior parental consent or parental notification, 
which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent 
use of the information and the child's participation in the 
activity. </p>
<p>** Without prior parental consent, online information will 
only be used to respond directly to the child's request for 
information and will not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>** Archie Comics will not entice any child or adult, 
regardless of their age, to divulge more personal information 
than is needed to use the site or participate in any online 
activity by offering any special game, prize, incentive or 
other similar activity.</p>
<p>** In no case will any personally identifiable information 
be distributed to third parties or otherwise posted, EXCEPT 
in the event of a Business Transfer, Merger, or Buyout of 
Archie Comics (see below for more details).</p>
<p><b>Information Collection and Use.</b></p>
<p>** Archie Comics uses the limited information it collects 
from visitors, if any, for internal research, and may use 
this information to customize the advertising and content 
seen on our pages. </p>

<p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>.</p>
<p>** Archie Comics will not contact children under 13 
about special offers or for marketing purposes without parental 
consent.<br>
<br>
**Archie Comics will not send personally identifiable 
information about a child to other companies or people, UNLESS 
we are required to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal 
process - to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><b>Ability to Update or Delete Information. </b></p>
<p>** Parents or Legal Guardians are welcome to request deletion of any information we may have on their 
child. <a href="../talkback.html">(Click Here) </a></p>

<p>** Please note that information about a child may remain 
in back-up storage for some period of time after a request 
for deletion of that child's account. This may be the case 
even though no information about that account remains in our 
active user databases.</p>
<p><b>Archie Comics's Use of 'Cookies'.</b></p>
<p>To enable many of the features available on our Website, 
we may assign cookies to your Internet browser. This unique 
identification number automatically identifies your browser 
(but not you) to our computers whenever you interact with 
one of our Internet domain names. When you visit our site, 
a cookie in effect says to our server computers "Hello, 
I'm browser #6426, what do you do just for me?" Only 
if you agree to provide information on yourself, which we 
normally discourage, would we be able to know anything about 
you other than the random number that our server computers 
assign to your browser in the first place. Cookies assist 
you, by assisting us in creating a record of your unique preferences. 
Archie Comics would only use cookies to determine how 
many visitors we have and how often they have visited particular 
pages on this site. We would not use cookies to indirectly 
obtain a personal profile on individual visitors, as some 
Website Operators choose to do through the assistance of profiling 
software.</p>
<p>Many people are confused about cookies, how they are used, 
and what they can do. Cookies are very small text files written 
by an Internet server to a customer's browser when information 
is exchanged. Cookies only contain information that the server 
computer "knew" in the first place and can only 
be read by the serving domain that placed them. Cookies are 
an essential part of how the Internet works today and allow 
servers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. 
If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically provides 
personalized content to you without requiring that you "log 
in," this is accomplished through the use of cookies. 
Since cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" 
on your computer and have no ability to search your computer 
for other information or transmit it to anyone. Cookies are 
implemented as part of the technology implemented by your 
web browser. </p>

<p><b>The Stuff Shop.</b></p>
<p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from the 
Stuff Shop will be required to provide their full name, billing 
and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and 
a credit card number. If the order is being shipped to a third 
party, we will also need the recipient's name and mailing 
address. Before collecting information in connection with 
a Stuff Shop order, we will verify the validity of the purchaser's 
credit card. On a rare occasion, we might solicit additional 
voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping 
preferences. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from 
ordering anything at all from our Stuff Shop without the express 
written permission of their Parent or Legal Guardian.</p>
<p><b>Business Transfer.</b> </p>
<p>In the event that Archie Comic Online or substantially all 
of its assets are acquired by a third party, customer information 
will be one of the transferred assets. However, use of any 
information collected on children under the age of 13, if 
among the transferred assets should such a transaction take 
place, will only be used in accordance with the policies set 
forth herein in compliance with COPPA.</p>
