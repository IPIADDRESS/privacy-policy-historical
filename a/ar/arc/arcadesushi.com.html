Disputes</h3><p data-reactid="303">Any disputes regarding this Privacy Policy are subject to the Terms of Service on the Website(s) that you access and will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, applicable to agreements made and performed in New York.  You agree that any and all disputes and causes of action arising out of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) and held at the JAMS regional office in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, New York.  This obligation applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a statute, or any other legal theory. Included are all claims that may arise after the termination of this Privacy Policy and claims related to direct marketing efforts, including complaints concerning unsolicited text messages, emails, and telemarketing calls. We agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not in a class action or representative proceeding. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual and not on a class-wide basis, and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and agree that this agreement specifically prohibits you from commencing arbitration proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any other person. This provision concerns a transaction in interstate commerce, and therefore shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.</p><p data-reactid="304">The remedy for any claim shall be limited to actual damages, and in no event shall any party be entitled to recover punitive, exemplary, consequential, or incidental damages, including attorney’s fees or other such related costs of bringing a claim or seek injunctive relief or any other equitable claim.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  For New Jersey residents, the previous two sentences apply only to the maximum extent permitted under New Jersey law.</p><h3 id="contact" data-reactid="305">17.
