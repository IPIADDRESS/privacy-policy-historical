Based in some very real techniques actually practiced around the world today, Absolver eschews the fantastical in favor of a more thoughtful and honest approach to martial arts. In fact, it&apos;s so authentic to all the skills many Sloclap members have actually learned over the years that its customization options might overwhelm even some of the most devout practitioners. Depth of combat is just one of the many reasons Absolver is going to change the way we play fighting games.","authors":{"id":746604,"slug":"lukebrown","name":"Luke Brown","first_name":"Luke ","last_name":"Brown","nickname":"lukebrown","description":"Arcade Sushi editor-in-chief Luke Brown is an experienced video game journalist who has contributed to Official Xbox Magazine and Games Radar.

Making things even more alien were the posters of &quot;Terror-Billy&quot; plastered over every open space that wasn&apos;t already filled with fascist propaganda or decoration.\r\n\r\nIn Wolfenstein II, you may be stepping into the shoes of a resistance hero, but in the Nazi-occupied United States, BJ Blazkowicz is public enemy number one.","authors":{"id":746604,"slug":"lukebrown","name":"Luke Brown","first_name":"Luke ","last_name":"Brown","nickname":"lukebrown","description":"Arcade Sushi editor-in-chief Luke Brown is an experienced video game journalist who has contributed to Official Xbox Magazine and Games Radar.
