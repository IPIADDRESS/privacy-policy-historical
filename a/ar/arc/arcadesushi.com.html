</div><div data-reactid="110"><p>2.2 When you interact with the Services, certain information about your use of the Services is automatically collected, regardless of whether you create an account on the Services.

At that point, we&apos;d already been playing Phoenix Labs&apos; upcoming multiplayer action role-playing game for a hunt or two, but wanted to change things up to see what the different weapon loadouts offered. After using the hammer to hunt down  massive frost-powered owl creature, we became enamored with it. Not just with the hammer gun mind you, but with the co-op action at the core of Dauntless.","authors":{"id":746604,"slug":"lukebrown","name":"Luke Brown","first_name":"Luke ","last_name":"Brown","nickname":"lukebrown","description":"Arcade Sushi editor-in-chief Luke Brown is an experienced video game journalist who has contributed to Official Xbox Magazine and Games Radar.

At that time, there was little to do but wander a randomly generated dungeon and complete a few small battles. Twelve months later, Nightwar still has that same delicious style and core battle mechanics, but Airship&apos;s been hard at work building on that template to craft a robust and deep RPG that will more than satisfy fans from both worlds.","authors":{"id":746604,"slug":"lukebrown","name":"Luke Brown","first_name":"Luke ","last_name":"Brown","nickname":"lukebrown","description":"Arcade Sushi editor-in-chief Luke Brown is an experienced video game journalist who has contributed to Official Xbox Magazine and Games Radar.
