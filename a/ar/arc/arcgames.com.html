    <p><b>What Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User&nbsp; of 
    yours is collected</b> </p>
    <p>Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous 
    or personally identifiable: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Anonymous Information" refers to information that cannot be tied back 
      to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people 
      visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their 
      names, where they live, or their date of birth.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>"Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User" or "PIIOCOU" 
      refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your 
      name, phone number, or postal address.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The amount of Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User 
    that you choose to disclose to us is completely up to you. In our effort to 
    provide personalization and opportunities for prizes and services, we may at 
    times ask you to submit information such as your name or email address, or 
    to share your interests and hobbies with us. The type of information may 
    include: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Credit card information to process your request for products, 
      programs, or services. </li>
      <li>Information you provide when registering to receive goods or services 
      from one or more of our partners. </li>
      <li>Information you provide when entering into a contest, sweepstakes or 
      promotion sponsored by ArcGames and/or one of our partners. </li>
      <li>Information you provide when filling out a user survey. </li>
      <li>Information you provide if you contact customer service. </li>
      <li>Data related to the areas of ArcGames that you visit and how often you 
      visit those areas. This includes co-branded sections of ArcGames that are 
      part of our overall service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange 
    of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold 
    requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the 
    services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a 
    personalized start page a personalized stock portfolio, a sweepstakes entry, 
    or the purchase and shipment of products and prizes to people who visit our 
    network. </p>
    <p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape 
    Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some 
    information to ArcGames every time you access content on one of our sites. 
    Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just 
    on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the 
    computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our 
    site. All of this information may be collected by ArcGames and used to help 
    improve our offerings to you. </p>
    <p>We use third-party advertising cookies to serve some of the ads that 
    appear when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not 
    including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your 
    visits to this and other Web sites to provide advertisements about goods or 
    services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information 
    about this practice and to know your choices about not having this 
    information used by these companies, we encourage you to contact those 
    companies directly or the Network Advertising Initiative at 
    www.networkadvertising.org for further information on the policies of major 
    third party ad servers and how to opt-out.. </p>
    <p><i>Children Under the Age of 13</i> </p>
    <p>As a matter of policy, ArcGames does not knowingly collect PIIOCOU from 
    anyone under the age of 13 or allow such persons to register. If you are a 
    person under age 13 who registered on the ArcGames Website prior to the date 
    of transfer, no data pertaining to you (including any PIIOCOU) has been 
    provided to us. </p>
    <p><b>How the information is used</b> </p>
    <p>We use the personal information you supply us, including your 
    registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services data, to enhance 
    our services, fulfill your requests for products, programs, or services, 
    personalize your experience and provide you or permit others to provide you 
    with special offers we think you will find valuable. We also use other 
    information obtained from user site traffic patterns to better provide you 
    with a personalized experience and special advertising offers and 
    promotions. We view personalized advertising as beneficial to our users. </p>
    <p>We also use your registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services 
    data information in connection with the sweepstakes and other promotions in 
    order to track your progress, to notify you if you are a winner and to 
    ensure that we comply with the applicable laws. </p>
    <p>ArcGames uses the information described above to do, among other things, 
    the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personalize and enhance the ArcGames site and service such as 
      providing you with your personalized information, and advertisements we 
      believe will be of interest to you. </li>
      <li>Send PIIOCOU about ArcGames and its site features, prizes and special 
      offers, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of 
      communications. </li>
      <li>Send you advertising from third parties including selected and trusted 
      ArcGames partners, unless you have opted out of receiving these types of 
      communications. </li>
      <li>Provide your PIIOCOU to selected 3rd parties unless you have opted not 
      to permit such sharing. </li>
      <li>Provide you with advertising and other promotional offers that we 
      believe will be of interest to you. </li>
      <li>Contact users for feedback regarding ArcGames and ArcGames's partners 
      via email surveys.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may also use the information we collect to develop summary reports for 
    our advertisers. An example of a summary report might be "200,000 people 
    clicked on this link and of those people, 35% were registered users above 
    the age of 25." We provide this information to assist our advertisers in 
    determining how to promote their products. We do not tell our advertisers 
    who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements unless you have told 
    us this is acceptable. </p>
    <p>Unless you have opted out of receiving special offers, emails or other 
    communications from selected third parties, we also may provide a report to 
    our advertiser which tells them who responded to a particular offer. For 
    example, we might send you an email, launch a new window within your 
    internet browser, or send you other advertisements in electronic form which 
    offer you a discount on a particular good or service. If you click on that 
    e-mail or advertisement or accept an offer or discount contained therein, we 
    may provide the advertiser with the information necessary to provide you 
    with that discount or offer. </p>
    <p>ArcGames may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to 
    provide Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User to 
    appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or 
    judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the 
    appropriate documentation. ArcGames may also provide information to law 
    enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of individual 
    as permitted by statute. </p>
    <p>Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect 
    information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content 
    through the use of cookies (using the same techniques as described above). 
    Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot control this 
    collection of information. As the consumer you should contact these 
    advertisers or content providers that place information on the ArcGames 
    Website directly if you have any questions about their use of the 
    information they potentially collect.</p>
    <p>Information that you provide while using products such as ArcGames 
    Message and/or forums Boards and ArcGames Chat (when instituted) is 
    available for all to see. Discretion should be used in entering Personally 
    Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User within such forums, as it may 
    be collected by third parties. ArcGames does not actively associate the 
    message content entered by our users in ArcGames Message and/or Forums 
    Boards, or ArcGames Chat (when instituted) products with those users' 
    registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services information. Our 
    server computers will retain this information, however; and it is 
    potentially available for distribution to third parties - most obviously 
    law-enforcement agencies acting under subpoena power, per the terms of this 
    section of our Privacy Policy. We do not use this information to target any 
    advertising to our users, nor is it ever willingly distributed to any third 
    party, such as an advertiser, except if subpoenaed.</p>
    <p><b>With whom the information may be shared</b> </p>
    <p>In general, ArcGames does not disclose your Personally Identifiable 
    Information Of Customer Or User to any third party without first providing 
    you with an opportunity to opt out, except in special situations described 
    below, such as to comply with the law or administer the site. Unless you 
    have opted out, ArcGames may make your Personally Identifiable Information 
    Of Customer Or User available to selected companies. You can elect to 
    opt-out at anytime by emailing us at
    <a href="mailto:administration@arcgames.com">administration@arcgames.com</a> 
    with OPTOUT as the subject. You can also elect not to use certain services 
    or participate in certain promotions if you do not want your information 
    shared with the third parties who are sponsoring or administering such 
    promotions. In the event that all or substantially all of ArcGames's stock 
    and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, ArcGames may 
    transfer Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User to the 
    acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your 
    Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User will be used in a 
    materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our 
    policy regarding notification of changes. </p>
    <p>ArcGames may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information Of 
    Customer Or User if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so 
    in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. 
    ArcGames may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer 
    Or User when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is 
    necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may 
    be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and 
    the public or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties 
    which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining ArcGames.</p>
    <p><b>What happens when you leave ArcGames to go to other sites</b> </p>
    <p>ArcGames does not control the information collection and distribution 
    policies on Internet domains other than those internet domains that are 
    under the control of ArcGames itself. When you are on the ArcGames Website, 
    you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. For example, 
    if you "click" on a banner advertisement or an ArcGames Website search 
    result, or a text link, or a picture link, the "click" may take you off the 
    ArcGames Website site. These other sites may independently collect data, 
    solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you. ArcGames is 
    not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data, 
    that you may create when using such third party sites. </p>
    <p>We also offer you access to "co-branded" services that are jointly 
    provided by ArcGames and selected companies. In many cases, these co-branded 
    services will contain ArcGames Website branding, but may not be hosted by 
    ArcGames. You may notice that you are on a co-branded site if the pages say 
    "provided by", "hosted by", "ArcGames Hosting, ArcGames Web Hosting", if 
    standard ArcGames branding is not displayed on the top of the page or at the 
    bottom of the page, or if you are asked to subscribe for any service or 
    provide additional information. In such cases, if you use the co-branded 
    service, ArcGames may be entitled to receive information about what you do 
    when using that service. If you elect to provide additional personal 
    information using a co-branded service, the information you provide may be 
    shared or jointly retained by the provider of that service in accordance 
    with that provider's privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you 
    to read the privacy polices of these other companies and to contact these 
    companies directly if you have any questions about their use of this 
    information. When you are using a co-branded service, we will attempt to 
    make sure that there is a link to the service provider's applicable privacy 
    policies and terms of service. </p>
    <p>We may also offer you access to software products which are installed on 
    an individual user's computer. ArcGames software applications automatically 
    communicate over the Internet with our servers and, in order to provide you 
    with ArcGames Website services, may convey to ArcGames certain information 
    regarding your activities at destinations other than the ArcGames Website, 
    such as the URL of sites you visit. ArcGames software applications may also 
    upgrade their functionalities from time to time, and some of these 
    functionalities may expand the scope of the information that is communicated 
    to ArcGames Website's servers.</p>
    <p><b>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and 
    distribution of personal information</b> </p>
    <p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose Personally Identifiable 
    Information Of Customer Or User and that choice will not prevent you from 
    using the ArcGames Website. Please note, however if you should choose to 
    withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some 
    of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as a 
    personalized information or newsletter, a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase 
    and shipment of products and prizes. </p>
    <p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from ArcGames or 
    from having your Personally Identifiable Information Of Customer Or User 
    shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by 
    emailing us at <a href="mailto:administration@arcgames.com">
    administration@arcgames.com</a> with OPTOUT as the subject. If you elect to 
    "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with 
    third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your 
    personal information for internal purposes, to conduct sweepstakes and 
    promotions, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer 
    the site or comply with applicable law. </p>
    <p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration of any of ArcGames 
    products and/or services confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert 
    messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their 
    ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of 
    email contact opt-in status. An example of a Service Alert message would be 
    notification of the impending closing of an account that is believed to be 
    abandoned. And finally, we also reserve the right to contact you if 
    compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a 
    violation of our Terms of Service. ArcGames is retaining these rights 
    because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you 
    as a matter of law or regarding matters which will be important to you. 
    These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing 
    service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of 
    communications are rare.</p>
    <p><i>Children Ages 13-17</i> </p>
    <p>We will not share the PIIOCOU of users who are 13 to 17 years old with 
    any third party - even if that user gave us permission to do so during 
    registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services - except in cases 
    where the information is being shared with a nonprofit organization that 
    offers bona fide outreach and support services to children. In cases where 
    minors have volunteered information in the context of a peer counseling or 
    mentoring environment on the ArcGames Website, this information will be 
    shared with that nonprofit organization. As reflected in this Privacy 
    Policy, we will provide PIIOCOU about our users age 13-17 to law enforcement 
    or judicial authorities upon request and receipt of proper documentation. 
    Additionally, if we believe that ArcGames property or an individual's safety 
    or security is at risk, we will provide this information to proper court or 
    law enforcement agencies. </p>
    <p>Although ArcGames will not share the PIIOCOU of users who are 13-17 years 
    old with any third party, the ArcGames Website includes co-branded web 
    properties, sponsor pages and links to other sites where you may be offered 
    an opportunity to provide PIIOCOU directly to a third party. If you elect to 
    provide such information, we recommend that you review the privacy practices 
    of that party. For more information on co-branded sites, see the section 
    entitled "What happens when you leave ArcGames to go to other sites", above.</p>
    <p><b>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the 
    loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control </b>
    </p>
    <p>ArcGames operates secure data networks protected by industry standard 
    firewall and password protection systems, along with special security 
    measures designed by ArcGames. Our security and privacy policies are 
    periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized 
    individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your 
    registration of any of ArcGames products and/or services account password is 
    encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly 
    sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for 
    a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission. </p>
    <p>ArcGames takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely 
    and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. 
    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
    secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, 
    we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or 
    from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own 
    risk. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ArcGames 
    will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an 
    unsolicited email. You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the 
    security of your ArcGames registration Name and password.</p>
    <p><b>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</b> </p>
    <p>ArcGames believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access 
    and edit the personal information that you have provided to us. To update 
    the information retained about you, or to deactivate your account that you 
    may have, please email us at <a href="mailto:administration@arcgames.com">
