		<meta name="Description" content="The Architect's Newspaper emerged from the desire, expressed by most architects we know, for a publication that speaks directly to them. We hear, constantly, that architects feel underserved or underwhelmed by existing design publications. They want something that reflects their interests and practices. No rah-rah, no puffery. Just useful information. Insightful, readable criticism. Diverse voices. Open dialogue.">
