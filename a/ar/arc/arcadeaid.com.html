      <p align="center" class="underline bold large">42 ENTERTAINMENT PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p class="underline bold">Introduction</p>

<p>42 Entertainment, LLC ("42 Entertainment") respects the privacy rights of our customers and is committed to protecting the information collected from you through our websites, social networking applications, software, and mobile applications ("Services").  To further this commitment, we have adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, use and disclose the information you provide to 42 Entertainment through our Services. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The information we collect, how we do so and the purposes of our collection</li>
  <li>How we use and with whom we share such information</li>
  <li>How you can access and update such information</li>
  <li>The choices you can make about how we collect, use and share your information</li>
  <li>How we protect the information we store about you</li>
</ul>
<p>By using our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our Services.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to read and accept the terms of service and privacy policy for the Services and any third-party platform that allows access to our Services (e.g. social networking sites, mobile application stores).  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other entities, through which certain of our Services are offered or to which our Services may be connected.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by 42 Entertainment in connection with your use of our Services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time and we encourage you to check back often to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version and the terms of our Privacy Policy.</p>


<p class="underline bold">1) Information We Collect</p>

<p class="bold">Technical and Usage Information</p>
<p>We receive and store certain types of non-personal technical information whenever you interact with us.  For example, we automatically send and receive information to and from your computer which we use to automatically update (new features, bug fixes, etc.) our Services.  We may collect your IP address, geolocation location information on mobile devices, operating system type, browser type, and other similar technical information. </p>
<p>Like many other companies, we also use "cookies" and other automated tools to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our Services.  While such information will typically be used in an aggregated way to improve our products and services, some information may be used to personalize your experience, or to offer you products and services specifically based on your preferences and usage.</p>

<p class="bold">Customer Support Correspondence</p>
<p>When you ask for assistance from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you provide, information about your experience with our Services or activity on the Services.</p>

<p class="bold">Purchase Related Information</p>

This personal information, such as first and last name, valid e-mail address and credit card billing data, may be necessary to purchase virtual currency, virtual items, enter a promotion or sweepstakes, or to otherwise transact business with us.</p>

<p class="bold">Information about You Received from a Social Networking Site, Your Application Store, or Mobile Device</p>
<p>If you access our Services using a mobile application from an app store or through a social networking site, certain information is available to us through those platforms.  The information you allow 42 Entertainment to access varies by what experience of Service we are offering, but certain Services may be available via a social networking platform or mobile application store, and is affected by the privacy settings you establish on those sites.  For example, 42 Entertainment may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the social networking site, the application store, and your preferences on your mobile device including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your first and last name</li>
  <li>Your profile picture or its URL on a social networking site</li>
  <li>Your mobile device technical information if you access our Services through a mobile device</li>
  <li>Your email address</li>
  <li>Your physical location and that of your access devices through geolocation</li>
  <li>Your gender</li>
  <li>Your birthday</li>
  <li>Your mobile device telephone number</li>
</ul>

<p class="bold">SMS Notifications</p>

These messages notify you of activity on our Services and may allow you to play certain elements of our transmedia experiences from your phone.  You can adjust the types of notifications you receive and when you receive them by editing your SMS notification settings.  Standard text messaging rates apply.  We will alert you if we ever use premium SMS texting.</p>

In such cases, 42 Entertainment's use of your personal information is governed by this Privacy Policy, and the other entity's use of your personal information is governed by that entity's own privacy policy and/or terms of service.</p>
<p>Compliance with Law, Protecting our Property or Users, Sale and Merger</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of 42 Entertainment, our customers, or the public.  In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed to a third party as part of any business transition, such as a bankruptcy, merger, sale, transfer of company assets, acquisition or similar event, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law. </p>

<p>We may use and share with third parties certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information among 42 Entertainment users.  We may also allow advertisers to collect technical or aggregated information, which they may share with us, with tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons.  (Beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner ads bring users to a given site.)</p>


<p class="underline bold">5) Children's Privacy</p>

We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use.  To prevent unauthorized electronic access to personal information, we maintain information collected online behind a firewall-protected server; use SSL encryption for purchases made through our Services; and limit access only to those employees performing a legitimate business function. </p>
<p>However, please understand that we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur.  Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.  In addition, we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe and to log out of your account after use. </p>
