				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				
				<p>Aruba Networks believes in the privacy of information obtained from our customers, partners, resellers, distributors, and other visitors to our website, and is committed to protecting that privacy. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we handle and view personal information of visitors to our websites and applies to Aruba Networks, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries worldwide.</p>
				
				<h3>Aruba’s Collection of Information</h3>
				<p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a national identification number, an email address, postal or physical address or other contact information, occupation, industry or other information including market questions needed to answer a request, to better provide information and services or to comply with various national, state, provincial or local governmental reporting requirements.</p>
				
				<p>The submission of personal information is voluntary. Aruba may collect personal information as described below. In each case, we only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to provide an individual with requested information and services and to conduct our business.</p>
				
				<h3>Aruba may collect personal information for purposes that include but are not limited to:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Viewing/accessing of white papers, technical briefs or product demonstrations</li>
					<li>Participation in marketing promotions, events, webinars, seminars, podcasts, teleconferences, executive roundtables, direct mail or general marketing</li>
					<li>Career opportunities or other Human Resources activities</li>
					<li>User surveys</li>
					<li>Use of our password protected “Channel Partner Site” portal</li>
					<li>Responding to a formal inquiry</li>
					<li>Providing product-oriented technical support or consulting services.</li>
					<li>In addition, when accessing certain documents or services on our website, visitors may be asked to provide certain information, such as how they can be contacted, where they work, and what they do. We may also track non-personal information (also see Why We May Use “Cookies” in this Privacy Policy Statement) about web pages and content accessed by visitors to Aruba’s website and the number of times such content is accessed by a specific visitor. Aruba collects this non-personal information in an effort to improve the quality of its website and also to answer questions as well as improve delivery and quality of information to visitors of the Aruba website.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Opting-Out</h3>
				<p>When personal information is collected, we will inform the individual at the point of collection, via a form or other method, the purpose for the collection and where appropriate, allow the individual to elect whether to provide the information to Aruba and/or specify how we can use such personal information. Aruba will allow interested parties to either “opt-in” or “opt-out” of specific communication by emailing or otherwise sending us an “unsubscribe” notice.</p>
				
				<h3>Why We May Use “Cookies”</h3>
				<p>A “cookie” is a message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a text file. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
				
				<p>The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customized Web pages for them. When you enter a Web site using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your Web browser which stores it for subsequent use. The next time you go to the same Web site, your browser will send the cookie to the Web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom Web pages. Instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, for example, you might see a welcome page with your name on it. Cookies can also help us recognize you as a unique visitor when you revisit the Aruba website, to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your specific preferred interests, or to avoid showing you the same advertisements repeatedly; be used to develop leads for our internal sales group and our business partners and provide direct marketing communications to you if you have explicitly consented to receive such communications; also help compile statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. Your personal identity, however, is not available via these statistics.</p>
				
				<p>Two types of cookies may be used on this website: session cookies (which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site) and persistent cookies (which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, though how long usually depends on the lifetime of the specific cookie).</p>
				
				<h3>You May Disable or Enable Cookies at Any Time</h3>
				<p>You have the ability to enable or disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser (you may need to consult your browser’s help file), as well as delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. However, you may not be able to use some of the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled/deleted.</p>
				
				<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
				<p>Aruba’s website may, from time to time, provide links to other third party websites which are outside our control and not covered by this Policy and may be different from this Policy. You may wish to review the privacy policies posted on all third party websites.</p>
				
				<h3>Privacy of Minors and Children</h3>
				<p>Our websites do not and will not target and are not intended to solicit or attract children. Aruba does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. For the purposes of this document, children means anyone under the age of 13.</p>
				
				<h3>Aruba’s Privacy Policy and Possible Future Changes to It</h3>
				<p>Aruba has the right to amend and change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Updated versions of this document with revised “updated” date will indicate new information is posted.</p>
