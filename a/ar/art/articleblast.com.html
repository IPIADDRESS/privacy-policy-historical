    <h2>3.  Information Collection Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>Information You Provide to Us</u>. We may collect information that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Services when you (i) register as a user of the Service; (ii) make changes to your user profile information, (iii) send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us through the Service, or (iv) use the Services, such as make a transaction through the Services.

        <u>Information Automatically Collected Through the Service</u>. Crowdtilt Open, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may automatically collect information about usage of your Crowdtilt Open site and those who visit and transact through it. The information automatically collected about those accessing or using your Crowdtilt Open site may include, but is not limited to, device ID, device type, browser type and version, geo-location information, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Service, ad data, IP address and standard web log information.

      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;To opt-out from having Google Analytics collect and use your information, please visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;To opt-out from having ClickTale collect and use your information, please visit http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        <u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u>. Crowdtilt Open, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may use cookies, locally stored objects and web beacons to automatically collect information about your use of the Services. Cookies are small bits of information that are transferred to and stored in separate files within your computer's browser. The Services uses both "persistent cookies" which remain on your computer after you have closed your browser as well as "session cookies" which exist only during a visitor's online session and disappear from your computer when you close your browser. Locally stored objects or "flash cookies" are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use.

You can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. You can also disable the storage of flash cookies. For additional information about managing and disabling flash cookies, please visit http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html. However, if you reject cookies or disable flash cookies you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.
