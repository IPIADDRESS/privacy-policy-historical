</div>

<p>
Artima Software, Inc. (“Artima” or “we”) believes your privacy is tremendously important.
We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. Below is our privacy
policy spelled out in the necessary legal language. It describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any
questions or comments regarding Artima's privacy policy or its enforcement, please contact us at privacy AT artima DOT com.
</p>

<p>
1. ABOUT THE ARTIMA NETWORK. The Artima Network, which consists of the Artima Developer (http://www.artima.com)
and other Web sites and email mailing lists (hosted at lists.artima.com), is owned and operated by Artima. 
</p>

<p>
2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT. Artima collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail
address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service.  We collect
non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways through your IP address, computer settings
or most-recently visited URL; see the sections below entitled “Cookies”, “Click Tracking”
and “IP Address”. If you contact Artima we may keep record of that correspondence. 
</p>

<p>
Our mailing lists require users to provide their email address. We use these email addresses to send the user
information about activities at the Web sites. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
“Opt Out” section below. 
</p>

<p>
From time to time, we may collect information on behalf of partners for the purpose of later delivering the
information to the partner, such as providing a form you must fill in to download a white paper or trial software
package from the partner; see the “Use of Information” section below.
</p>

<p>
3. COOKIES. A “cookie” is small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and
stored on your computer’s hard drive.  We use cookies in parts of our Web sites to allow you to log in
and, optionally, to automatically remember your username and password.  
</p>

<p>
We sometimes use outside ad companies to display ads on our site.  These ads also may contain cookies.  Cookies
received with banner ads are collected by the ad company, and we do not have access to this information.  
</p>

<p>
By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie
is set, or to reject all cookies.  If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those 
Web site services that require cookies to participate.
</p>

<p>
4. PUBLIC FORUMS. Our sites may make discussion forums, chat rooms, message boards and/or news groups available
to their users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information.
You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
</p>

<p>
5. CLICK TRACKING. Artima uses a method called “click tracking” to log user movement throughout our
service. As part of this effort, we passively collect IP address, Web browser type, domain names, access times,
referring URLs and page views for each session. This information is used to keep track of login names and
passwords, to offer users a personalized experience, to enhance navigation, to provide content tailored to
the user’s interest, and to time out their session.
</p>

<p>
6. USE OF INFORMATION. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first
obtaining your express consent, unless required by law.   Non-personal demographic and profile data may be shared
with advertisers or partners on an aggregated basis.
</p>

<p>
From time to time we will send out email to our subscribers for third parties. You may opt out of receiving
communications from us below. Pages containing forms with which we collect
information on behalf of partners, as described in the “Information We Collect” section above, will
contain a notice similar to: “The information you submit with this form will be shared with
&lt;partner name&gt;.” By submitting data via a form contained on a page with such a notice, you give us
permission to share the submitted data with that partner.
</p>

<p>
7. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES. Artima Network Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that
Artima is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide
any information directly to parties other than Artima, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the
personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal
information to third parties.
</p>

<p>
8. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we
will not knowingly provide access to the Artima Network to persons under the age of thirteen (13).
If Artima later learns that any member (the owner of a user account) is under the age of thirteen (13), we will
take appropriate steps to remove the member’s information and postings from our Web sites and restrict that
member from future access to their Artima Network account until they reach age 13.
</p>

<p>
9. OPT OUT. Our sites provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us.  We give users
the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or
to no longer receive our service. 
</p>

<p>
To unsubscribe from an Artima newsletter or opt-in list, log in and edit your settings at: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.artima.com/account">http://www.artima.com/account</a>
</p>

<p>
Uncheck the checkboxes next to the lists from which you'd like to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests will generally be
acted upon within 48 to 72 hours.
</p>

<p>
10. IP ADDRESSES. The Artima Network automatically receives and records your IP address information in our server logs.
This information is only visible to Artima administrators and is used to calculate how many unique users visit Artima Network
Web sites each month, to better understand how our audience uses the site, to identify and block individuals who are not
permitted to use our service, to provide better, more customized service to our users, to help diagnose problems with our
server, and to administer the Web site.
</p>

<p>
11. CORRECT/UPDATE. You can change any information previously provided by logging in and editing your settings at: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.artima.com/account">http://www.artima.com/account</a>
</p>

<p>
We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is corrected in our records.
</p>

<p>
12. SECURITY PROCEDURES. Artima has implemented security measures to protect member information from loss,
misuse and alteration. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal
regulations to protect personal information about you.
</p>

<p>
13. CONSENT. This Privacy Policy is a part of the Artima Network’s Terms of Use Agreement. By using the
Artima Network, users are using a service provided by Artima and they agree to be bound by the Terms of Use Agreement
and this Privacy Policy. Some terms may be defined in the Terms of Use Agreement. This Privacy Policy only addresses
activities from our servers. 
</p>

<p>
14. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES. If Artima changes its policy and seeks to use your personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be notified via email or a system message
visible on the Artima Network Web sites. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that
do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a notice on our Web site notifying users
of the change. In some cases where we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications
from us to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices.  Your continued use of the Artima Network following the
posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof. 
</p>
