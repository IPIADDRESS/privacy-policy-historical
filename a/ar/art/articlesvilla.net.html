			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Articlesvilla.net strives to offer its visitors the many advantages  of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized  experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name,  e-mail address) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will  never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third  party. Period.</p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information  when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You  may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and  contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of  our site. Like most Web sites, Articlesvilla.net also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that  may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of  your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you  and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie  may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to  re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number  of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our  site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us  with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to  accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and  password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features  according to your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your  visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We  respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify  you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information  about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other  users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages  are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business  partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally  Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you  individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  www.Articlesvilla.net to communicate with you about your registration  and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;  services and products offered by www.Articlesvilla.net and other topics  we think you might find of interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Articlesvilla.net  may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications  with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the  operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access  such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law.  In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,  we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses.  In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred  assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court  order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do  so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to  us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it  appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice  prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
<p>Articlesvilla.net expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third  parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other  content providers accessible through our site, may have their own  privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during  your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a  www.Articlesvilla.net page, certain content that is actually created or  hosted by a third party. Also, through Articlesvilla.net you may be  introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,  contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Articlesvilla.net is  not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You  should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when  providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other  third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify  some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For  example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may  include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have  seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our  site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies  or other technology to gather information. Articlesvilla.net does not  control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting  information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such  third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by  third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are  beyond the control of Articlesvilla.net and this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Articlesvilla.net does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as  permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a  child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that  information immediately. If you believe Articlesvilla.net has any  information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the  address listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>
<p>We can be reached by emailing us.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p>
<p>Articlesvilla.net reserves the right to change this policy at any  time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued  use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will  mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time  any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that  applied at the time the information was collected.</p>
<p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a  dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it  with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following  location: Austin. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated  with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution  through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding  arbitration at the following location: Austin, under the rules of the  American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by  the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to  and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf  of any party.</p>
