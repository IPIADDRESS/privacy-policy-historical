    <big>Privacy Policy Overview</big></strong></p>
    <p>We understand your need to maintain your privacy when using the Internet for your communication, shopping, 	exploration and play. &nbsp; </p>
    <p>We ask you for your personal information when you register as a user on our site, when you make a purchase or enter a contest or sweepstakes. We also may ask you various questions about your interests or preferences. We use this information to personalize the site for you, to inform you about or offer you new features or services customized to your preferences, for marketing purposes, to contact you about your purchases, or to notify you if you have won a prize or contest.</p>
   <p>We'll give you the choice whether to receive email or other contact from us and from any of the companies we work with, and we give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving unwanted communications (click <a href="#Choice/Opt-Out">here</a> for instructions.) Finally, we provide the opportunity for you to update and/or correct information we have about you (click <a href="#Correct/Update">here</a> for instructions.) </p><p> We do not sell your personally identifiable information. We may share it with companies that help us operate the site, such as our credit card companies and the company that packages and ships our merchandise for delivery to you. We might also share it with prize providers of sweepstakes and contests. We may share your personal information with other companies that provide products or services we think will be of interest to you.</p>
    <p>We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard any personal information, and any financial information we receive from you is encrypted. However, we may be required to release personal information about you as a result of a law suit or subpoena or as immediately necessary to protect our rights or the rights and safety of other users. Additionally, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet.</p>
    <p>For a complete discussion of the terms of our Privacy Policy, please see the FAQ below. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of our <a target="top" href="http://www.artistdirect.com/faq/termsofuse.html">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.

    <p><a name="1"><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></a><br>This Website collects information that falls into one of two categories - personally identifiable information and aggregated information.  Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you.  Aggregated information is information that is not associated with a specific user, such as the number of people who visit the Website from various states.</p><p>
We collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, residence address, and credit card information) whenever you voluntarily submit it to the Website.  Examples of this type information include when you make a purchase, answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback or post in our chat rooms or message boards. If you register, we might also ask you about your music preferences or other information to customize the site for you.  You always have the option of choosing not to reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be unavailable if you do not.  In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our Website or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.</p><p>
In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis.  For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><a href="#FAQ"><small>back to FAQ</small></a></p>
    <p><a name="2"><strong>How do we use
    the personal information we collect?</strong></a><br>
     Both aggregated and personally identifiable information is used to operate and enhance our site and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you.</p><p>
Except as described below or otherwise indicated, we do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.  On some pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, we may tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties.  Information gathered from such pages may be shared with or sold to third-parties.</p><p>
We also may share or sell your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to our Website or are affiliated with our Website in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Website, and to provide you with new products and services.  </p><p>
We use the personal information we collect to communicate about or deliver a purchase, to notify you if you've won a prize, or to be able to personalize a part of the site with the services and information you choose. If you chose to subscribe to our newsletter or have not opted out of getting email from us or from other companies about events, products and services, we use your personal information to select and deliver messages to you.</p><p>
Aggregated information is used to sell and deliver advertising. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties, including informing our advertisers whether their advertisement was effective.</p><p>
Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email address in an email to a third party or when you order merchandise in the Superstore.  Importantly, information you provide as part of your Member Profile is not confidential, and is accessible by the public.  Similarly, any information you provide in chat rooms, message boards, or other public forums is not confidential.  For such activities, a separate warning may not be provided.  Your choice to disclose personally identifiable information in these cases is voluntary.</p><p>
In addition, you agree that ARTISTdirect.com may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of ARTISTdirect.com or its affiliated entities.</p>

    <p><a name="3"><strong>Is
    the Site secure so that other people can not obtain your information from the site without
    your consent?</strong></a><br>
   Personal information that we collect is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Credit card information is encrypted. All the information we collect and store is protected by our firewall. Also, any information that we store at our business is kept secure, and only designated employees may obtain access to it. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet.

      <p><a href="#FAQ"><small>back to FAQ</small></a></p>
     <p><a name="4"><strong>Limits on our abilities</strong></a><br>
    We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties.  We may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

    the privacy of users who are 13 and under?</strong></a><br>We are committed to protecting the safety and privacy of all our users, including those who are 13 or under. We do not collect or display personally identifiably information about users who are under the age of 13.</p>

Arrangements can be made for a user to determine what personal information we have stored about that user.

We use cookies or IP addresses for a number of uses, including helping us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests, and to allow us to better understand how users use our site. You are always free to instruct your web browser to decline our cookies if it has the capability to do so, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do.</p><p>
