<p>(d) in order to protect or defend our rights or property or to protect the personal safety of our employees or the public at large.</p>
<p>4.3 We may from time to time engage third parties to perform services (including the processing of personal data) on our behalf, such as hosting our data (including your personal data) and Website; sending emails and other communications relating to our products and/or services; providing analytic services, such as tracking usage of our operational sites or websites; or performing other administrative services for us. We shall only use processors that will commit to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure that their processing activities meet the requirements of Data Privacy Laws and ensure the protection of your data protection rights. Prior to allowing these service providers to access your personal data, we will enter into a formal agreement with them to ensure that they handle and process the information in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>4.4 We will not share your information with parties outside of the European Economic Area (the <strong>EEA</strong>) unless we are legally permitted or required to do so. You should be aware that certain non-EEA countries do not require the same standards of protection of personal data as are legally required in the EEA. If we send your data to these countries, we will ensure that there are appropriate and suitable safeguards to protect your personal data. This will involve at least one of the following:</p>
<p>(a) we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;</p>
<p>(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and</p>
<p>(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</p>
<p>If you require further information on these mechanisms, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@artuk.org">info@artuk.org</a>.</p>
<p><b><b>5. Data security</b></b></p>
<p>5.1 All information you provide to us is stored within the EEA on secure servers provided by a third party vendor. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to our Website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we will limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to access your data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>5.2 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>5.3 The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. It is your responsibility to check those policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
<p><b><b>6. Your rights</b></b></p>
<p>6.1 You have the right to:</p>
<p>(a) request access to personal data held about you by us and be provided with information in relation to that data (including the purposes for which the data are processed, the recipients to whom that personal data have been or will be disclosed, how long it will be stored for, details of any automated decision-making and your right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office);</p>
<p>(b) have inaccurate personal data amended or erased, and to have incomplete personal data completed;</p>
<p>(c) request the erasure of your personal data (the so-called ‘right to be forgotten’);</p>
<p>(d) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data (including where your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes or on the basis of legitimate interests);</p>
<p>(e) request that your personal data be transferred to another data controller or provided in a format that will permit this transfer (the so-called ‘right to portability’);</p>
<p>(f) object to any decision that affects you being taken solely by a computer or other automated process (including profiling);</p>
<p>(g) withdraw any consent you have granted to us in connection with the use of your personal data at any time by updating your preferences in your online account via the Website or by emailing <a href="mailto:info@artuk.org">info@artuk.org</a>; and</p>
<p>(h) lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (<strong>ICO</strong>) (see https://ico.org.uk/concerns/ for further details on how to lodge a complaint). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
<p><b><b>7. <strong>Retention of personal data</strong></b></b></p>
<p>Your personal data will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required for the relevant specified purpose that it was collected for, provided that we may retain personal data in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules. As a general rule, this means we will retain your personal data for the duration of your involvement with us and for up to six years afterwards. However, retention and destruction of personal data will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

</ul>
<ul>

<li>Legitimate Business Interests – this means the interests of Heritage Digital Ltd in managing our business to provide you with the best products, service and customer service in the most secure and appropriate way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Legal Obligation – where there is statutory or other legal requirement to share the information e.g. when we have to share your information with government and civil departments for the purposes of law enforcement and the investigation of any fraudulent activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a list of the ways that we may use your personal information, and which of the reasons described above we rely on to do so.</p>
