<h1 class="title">Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>ArticlesAlley.com Directory Privacy Policy</p><p>
  ArticlesAlley.com Directory strives to offer its visitors the many  advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and  personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your  name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of  this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to  any unauthorized third party. </p><p>
  <strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p><p>
  How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access  to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as  newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you  participate on our site. Like most Web sites ArticlesAlley.com Directory also  collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that  may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your  Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold  information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user  name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each  time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we  may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can  choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser  to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,  and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your  preferences.</p><p>
  <strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p><p>
  Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy  and do not share your information with anyone.</p><p>
  Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)  may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help  enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or  what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be  shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does  not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone  to identify you individually.</p><p>
  We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on ArticlesAlley.com  Directory to communicate with you about your registration and customization  preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products  offered by ArticlesAlley.com Directory and other topics we think you might find  of interest.</p><p>
  Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticlesAlley.com Directory  may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.  Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our  site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will  use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time  as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with  other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be  among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to  do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,  and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or  necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure  in such cases.</p><p>
  <strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p><p>
  ArticlesAlley.com Directory expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates  to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link  to, or view as part of a frame on an ArticlesAlley.com &nbsp;Directory page, certain content that is  actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticlesAlley.com &nbsp;Directory you may be introduced to, or be able  to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by  other parties. ArticlesAlley.com Directory is not responsible for the actions  or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy  policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page  operated by a third party.</p><p>
  While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your  preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our  advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the  advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement  before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third  parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. ArticlesAlley.com  Directory does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the  resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of  such third parties.</p><p>
  You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ArticlesAlley.com  Directory and this policy. </p><p>
  <strong>Children</strong></p><p>
  ArticlesAlley.com Directory does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by  law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in  violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you  believe ArticlesAlley.com Directory has any information from or about anyone  under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p><p>
  <strong>Contacting Us</strong></p><p>

  <strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p><p>
  ArticlesAlley.com Directory reserves the right to change this policy at any  time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of  our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept  those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted  will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the  information was collected.</p><p>
  <strong>Governing law</strong></p><p>
  This policy and the use of this Site are governed by United States and  Michigan law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to  resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon arbitrator in the following  location: Detroit, Michigan or Southfield, Michigan. Any costs and fees other  than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each  of us.</p><p>
  If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution  through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the  following location: Detroit, Michigan, U.S., under the rules of U.S. and  Michigan Law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be  entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p><p>
