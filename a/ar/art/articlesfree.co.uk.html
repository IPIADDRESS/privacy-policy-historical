<p class="articletitle"><strong>Articles Free Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>ArticlesFree  strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet  technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail  address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this  privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address  to any unauthorized third party. Period.
</p><div id="content">
<div>
<div>

  <p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong>    </p>
  <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information  when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You  may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and  contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of  our site. Like most Web sites, ArticlesFree also collects information  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be  transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your  Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and  hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may  store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter  that information each time you visit, or may control the number of  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.  As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us  with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to  accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and  password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features  according to your preferences.
    * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
    * Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
    * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.    </p>
  <p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong> </p>
  <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your  visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We  respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

    Aggregated Information (information that does not personally  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine  information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained  from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn  which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).  Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers  and business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.

    We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  www.ArticlesFree to communicate with you about your registration and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;  services and products offered by www.ArticlesFree and other topics we  think you might find of interest.

    Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticlesFree may  also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications  with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the  operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access  such information. We will use your information only as permitted by  law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our  business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or  businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the  transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably  required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts  you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we  deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you  with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. </p>
  <p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong> </p>
  <p>ArticlesFree expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third  parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other  content providers accessible through our site, may have their own  privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during  your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a  www.ArticlesFree page, certain content that is actually created or  hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticlesFree you may be  introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features,  contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. ArticlesFree is not  responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You  should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties  when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third  party.

    While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other  third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to  identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.  For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may  include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you  have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available  on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use  cookies or other technology to gather information. ArticlesFree does  not control the use of this technology by third parties or the  resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or  policies of such third parties.

    You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by  third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are  beyond the control of ArticlesFree and this policy. </p>
  <p><strong>Children</strong> </p>
  <p>ArticlesFree does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as  permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from  a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that  information immediately. If you believe ArticlesFree has any  information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the  address listed below. </p>
  <p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong> </p>
  <p>ArticlesFree reserves the right to change this policy at any time.  Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of  our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you  accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any  change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that  applied at the time the information was collected. </p>
  <p><strong>Governing law</strong> </p>
  <p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by USA law. If a  dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it  with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following  location: Austin. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees  associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.

    If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory  solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding  arbitration at the following location: Austin, under the rules of the  American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by  the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.

    This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to  and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf  of any party. </p>
  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
