<p><strong>Connecting with Other Users.</strong> We aim to provide a platform and marketplace where Users can discover and engage with a wide range of artwork, design and other items from around the world, including items from the various galleries, institutions and others that use our Services as exhibitors or sellers. To help make this happen, our Services may include features, such as messaging tools and email addresses hosted on our Services, that enable you to contact and communicate with other Users. For example, when a gallery or other seller lists an artwork or other item on our Services, our Services may enable you to contact them about that item or about other items they may have available. </p>

As mentioned above, this Policy does not apply to any entity that we do not own or control, or to any person that we do not employ or manage, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.</p>
<h2 id="with-whom-do-we-share-personal-information-">With Whom do We Share Personal Information?</h2>

We do receive certain information from the payment processor, including a unique token that we associate with you to authorize your purchases, and in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, in order to help prevent fraud and identity theft. </p>
<h2 id="other-websites-and-services">Other Websites and Services</h2>

<p>Artsy is based in the United States. Our Users (including the galleries and other organizations that use our Services as exhibitors or sellers), service providers, and other third parties you may interact with in connection with our Services, may be located in the United States and other countries around the world, including countries that may not offer the same level of protection for Personal Information as that offered in the United States. By accessing or using our Services in the United States or any other country or jurisdiction, you agree that your information may be transferred and processed in the United States and any other country or jurisdiction.</p>

<h2 id="children-s-information">Children’s Information</h2>

If you believe we may have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13, please <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">contact us</a>. </p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Every Artsy account is protected by a password to help maintain privacy and security on our Services. If you register for an account, we urge you to use a strong password containing unique numbers, letters and special characters, and to protect the confidentiality of your password at all times. If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or password, you agree to immediately <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">notify us</a> and change your password. Please note that while we seek to protect your information and maintain the security of our Services, due to the possibility of hardware or software failure, unauthorized entry or use and other factors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information, whether online or offline. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. Please also note that any information you provide to us via email is unencrypted.</p>
<h2 id="statutory-requests">Statutory Requests</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions have laws that give people the right to access or correct their Personal Information which a company has about them. We will honor any statutory right you may have to access or correct your Personal Information that we have in our records, and you can email such requests to <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>. Once we receive your request, we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfill your request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, would require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an existing practice), would jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical to fulfill (for example, requests to access information located on backup systems). </p>
<h2 id="eu-u-s-privacy-shield">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</h2>
<p>Artsy is a participant in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and we have certified that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, such as tracking URLs, to collect information about how you or others access or engage with our Services, Content, emails, and ads displayed on or off our Services, and to operate, develop, improve, and customize our Services, Content, and marketing, including ads displayed on or off our Services. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may have settings that enable you to decline or delete cookies on your device.

For example, a cookie could enable our Services to recognize your browser, while another cookie could store your account preferences and other information to help make our Services more customized. We may use two kinds of cookies, “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or are deleted. “Web beacons” (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFS”) are pieces of code or pixels embedded in a web page or email to track engagement with and responses to emails, web pages or ads, or to access or communicate with cookies. “Tracking URLs” are special URLs that can be used to track engagement with and responses to emails or web pages.</p>

These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to help provide their services to us, and to collect information about your and others’ online activity across different websites. These providers may also collect your IP address, device identifier, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The third-party advertising providers we use include but are not limited to Google Analytics, and we use its Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting features, which enables Google Analytics to collect data about traffic on our Services through <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">Google advertising cookies</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous identifiers</a>. We and third-party providers, including Google Analytics, may use first-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by the website you are visiting) and third-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by a third-party website other than the website you are visiting) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Services. We do not control the practices of any third-party providers, and this Cookie Policy (and our Privacy Policy in general) does not cover the use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by any third parties. </p>
<p><strong>Opting-Out.</strong> Third-party providers may offer you a way to opt-out of receiving cookies from them by visiting their own websites or the websites of industry groups such as the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. For example, you may opt-out of receiving ad-related cookies from Google through its <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">Ad Settings</a>. If you opt-out of receiving cookies from one of these providers, it may place a cookie on your device to remember your preference. Accordingly, if you delete cookies, install a new browser, or start using a new device, you may need to repeat the opt-out process. We do not respond to browser-initiated “do not track” signals, as there currently is not an industry standard for responding to them. </p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Cookie Policy.</strong> As this Cookie Policy is part of our Privacy Policy, we may update it at any time as described in our Privacy Policy. Please review this Cookie Policy regularly to be informed of any updates.</p>
