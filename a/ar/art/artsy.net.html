<p>Your privacy is important to us, and we want you to be informed about our privacy practices and your choices about privacy as an Artsy user. This Privacy Policy describes how Artsy may collect and use your information when you use the Artsy website, products and services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use, which can be viewed at: <a href="/terms">artsy.net/terms</a>. By using the Services, you agree that your information may be collected, stored, shared and used as described in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and feel free to <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">contact us</a> if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your privacy as an Artsy user. </p>

<h2 id="personalinformation">Personal Information</h2>

<p>In this Privacy Policy, the term "Personal Information" refers to information about a person that can be used to contact or identify that person. You may be asked to provide certain Personal Information when you register for an Artsy account or use certain features of the Services. Personal Information includes but is not limited to your name, username, email address, shipping address, phone number and payment information. You may choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but this may limit your ability to register for an Artsy account or our ability to provide you with certain features of the Services. We will only share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise with your prior consent. </p>

<h2 id="additionalinformation">Additional Information</h2>

<p>Besides Personal Information, you may provide us with additional information when you use the Services, for example, in forms that you complete on the Services, in your user profile, or otherwise when you communicate with us, including but not limited to information about your preferences and interests. This additional information would be considered part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be personally identified, for example, if preference information is combined with your name or contact information. However, by itself, this additional information is not personally identifying and is not considered Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h2 id="logdata">Log Data</h2>

<p>As with many online service providers, our systems record certain information about how users access and use the Services. Examples of this log data may include Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet browser and operating system used to access the Services, device and application identifiers, access times and dates, referring and exit pages, click-stream data, pages viewed, time spent on pages, search terms, transaction information, location, bounce rate and login frequency. We may use log data to administer the Services and to customize, measure and improve the Services for you and other users.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Depending on your Internet browser type and settings, we may use “cookies” to record log data or to store certain information (e.g. login information) so you will not have to re-enter it later in your visit or the next time you use the Services. Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or other device to record or store information. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies remain on your computer until you choose to delete them or they expire. Most browsers have an option to disable cookies. However, disabling cookies may limit our ability to provide you with certain features of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to our own use of cookies and not to the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>

<h2 id="mobileuse">Mobile Use</h2>

<p>You may be able to access the Services using a mobile device, either through a mobile application or a mobile web browser. When you download or use our applications or otherwise access the Services from a mobile device, we may receive information about your location and mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device which may be used to customize the Services for your location. Most mobile devices enable you to control or disable location services in the device’s settings menu, and your choices for location services may vary depending on the mobile device that you use to access the Services.</p>

<h2 id="ouruseofinformation">Our Use of Information</h2>

<p>In addition to other uses specified in this Privacy Policy, we use your information mainly to administer and operate the Services, to communicate with you, and to provide you with the products, services and information that you request. We may also combine your Personal Information with other information we obtain from you and aggregate it with information collected from other users in order to customize, measure and improve the Services, for example, by informing our choices of which products and features to develop and offer to you and other users. We may also use your combined information to serve you individually, for example, to provide or recommend artwork, products or services to you based on your use of the Services and your preferences and interests.</p>

<h2 id="communications">Communications</h2>

<p>We may email you or otherwise contact you to provide you with individual support, for example, to communicate with you about your account, inquiries or transactions. If you communicate with us by email, phone or otherwise, we may keep a record of those communications. We may also email you to promote artwork, products or services, or to provide you with general information about the Services, for example, to inform you about new features or other updates to the Services. If you do not wish to receive promotional communications from us, you may indicate this preference by following the instructions in our emails or adjusting your account settings. However, we may still send you non-promotional communications such as those regarding your inquiries or transactions, your relationship with Artsy, or updates to the Services or our general policies.</p>

<h2 id="accountsandprofiles">Accounts and Profiles</h2>

<p>To register for an Artsy account, you will be required to provide your full name and a valid email address. Registered users may access, add, remove or update certain information in their account settings or user profile, and it is your responsibility to keep all information in your account settings and user profile accurate and up to date. To facilitate interaction between users, certain information that you enter in your user profile will be publicly accessible through the Services and associated with you, unless we indicate otherwise, including your username, bio, location, website and profile picture. If you provide us with your phone number, it will be used only to provide you with individual support and will not be published on the Services, unless you specifically choose to do so. If your account is terminated, we may keep a record of the Personal Information associated with your account and use of the Services as required or permitted by law for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="usercontentandfollows">User Content and Follows</h2>

<p>As described in our Terms of Use, the Services may include interactive features that enable users to post or share certain User Content or other Content on the Services in a way that will be accessible to others. When you post User Content on the Services, any information (including Personal Information) in the User Content becomes publicly accessible and may be indexed by third party search engines, and may be published and otherwise used by us as described in our Terms of Use. Accordingly, all users should be considerate of others when posting information on the Services. In addition, the Services may include features that enable you to “follow” other users in order to view the User Content and other Content that they post or share through the Services. To facilitate interaction on the Services, users may be notified of which other users have followed them. </p>

<h2 id="otherwebsitesandservices">Other Websites and Services</h2>

<p>The Services may provide links and features that enable you to access other websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other websites or services, and we encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites or services that you access. If you login to Artsy through another social networking service or you link your Artsy account to your account on another social networking service, we may record your username on that service and other information that you make publicly accessible through that service, which may vary depending on your privacy settings on that service. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any entities that we do not own or control, or to any people that we do not employ or manage.  </p>

<h2 id="nonpersonalinformation">Non-Personal Information</h2>

<p>We may aggregate or anonymize log data or other information that we obtain from you or other users so that the information does not contain any Personal Information. We may use and share such aggregated or anonymized information or other non-personally identifying information for any purposes, including but not limited to marketing or general demographic and industry analysis. Information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. </p>

<h2 id="affiliatedbusinesses">Affiliated Businesses</h2>

<p>We work with affiliated businesses that may offer or sell goods or services to you through the Services, including the galleries, organizations and others that may use the Services to exhibit or sell artwork and other property. If you purchase goods or services from an affiliated business or you otherwise choose to interact with an affiliated business through the Services, we may share your Personal Information related to that purchase or interaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transactions and use of the Services. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of affiliated businesses, and where applicable, you are encouraged to read their privacy policies to be informed of how they may use your information.</p>

<h2 id="thirdpartyserviceproviders">Third Party Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may have third party companies or individuals provide services on our behalf related to the Services, including but not limited to maintenance services, email administration, web and data analytics, and database hosting. Unless we indicate otherwise, these third party service providers are permitted to use your Personal Information only as applicable to perform their services on our behalf.  </p>

<h2 id="paymentinformation">Payment Information</h2>

<p>If you make a purchase on the Services, you may be able to enter certain payment information, such as your credit card number, type and expiration date. We do not store credit card information entered on the Services. Such information is stored by our third party payment processor, and the use and storage of such information will be subject to the payment processor’s own <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/terms">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. We receive certain information from our payment processor, including a unique token that we connect with your account to authorize your purchases. In certain cases, we may also receive the last four digits of the credit card number associated with your token in order to prevent fraudulent transactions or other unauthorized activity. Any credit card information entered on the Services will be encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for your protection.</p>

<h2 id="internationaluse">International Use</h2>

<p>Artsy is based in the United States, and the affiliated businesses and service providers described in this Privacy Policy may be located in the United States and other countries around the world. If you use the Services in the United States or any other country, you agree that your information may be transferred and processed in the United States and in other countries besides the country in which you live, including countries that may not offer the same degree of protection for Personal Information as that offered in the United States.  </p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>Every Artsy account is protected by a password to maintain privacy and security on the Services. We urge you to use a strong password containing unique numbers, letters and special characters, and to protect the confidentiality of your password at all times. If you suspect that your password has been compromised, you should immediately notify us and change your password. In addition, we use strong encryption to protect user information on the Services, and we do not store or transmit any clear text passwords. However, due to the possibility of hardware or software failure, unauthorized entry or use and other factors, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information in our systems. </p>

<h2 id="businesstransfers">Business Transfers</h2>

<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, the Personal Information of our users may be one of the assets transferred. In this event, registered users will be notified by email of any such change of ownership or applicable privacy policies. </p>

<h2 id="childrenundertheageof13">Children Under the Age of 13</h2>

<p>The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from people in this age group. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete the information. If you believe that we may have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>.   </p>

<h2 id="legalpurposes">Legal Purposes</h2>

<p>We may access, preserve and disclose any Personal Information or other user information if we believe that access, use, preservation and disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or government request; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use or any other Artsy agreements or policies, or investigate potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Artsy, you or any other person or entity.</p>

<h2 id="changestothisprivacypolicy">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please review it periodically. Unless we notify you otherwise, the most current version of this Privacy Policy will apply to any information that we have about you and your account. We will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy by posting the updated version of this Privacy Policy on the Services, and in certain circumstances we may also provide notice of changes by posting an additional notice on the Services or by email. Your continued use of the Services after any changes to this Privacy Policy become effective will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
