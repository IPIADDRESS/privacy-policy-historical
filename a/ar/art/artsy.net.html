<p><strong>Registration, Access and Records </strong> To register for an Artsy account, you will need to provide your full name and a valid email address. If you have received our permission to use our Services as a business, you may need to complete an additional registration process and provide additional information.

It is your responsibility to update all such information as necessary to keep it accurate and current.

<h2 id="favorites-and-follows">Favorites and Follows</h2>
<p>Our Services may include features that enable you to designate your “favorite” artists, designers or other creators, artwork or other items, or categories of artwork or other items. Our Services may also include features that enable you to “follow” galleries, institutions or other Users, artists, designers or other creators, or categories of artwork or other items.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the right to share any information about others that you may share with us or with others through our Services. </p>
<h2 id="user-communications">User Communications</h2>
<p><strong>Connecting with Other Users.</strong> We aim to provide a platform and marketplace where Users can discover and engage with a wide range of artwork, design and other items from around the world, including items from the various galleries, institutions and others that use our Services as exhibitors or sellers. To help make this happen, our Services may include features, such as messaging tools and email addresses hosted on our Services, that enable you to contact and communicate with other Users. For example, when a gallery or other seller lists an artwork or other item on our Services, our Services may enable you to contact them about that item or about other items they may have available. </p>
<p><strong>Sharing Information with Other Users.</strong> When you use our Services to contact another User or perform a transaction with another User, they may obtain your name, email address and (as applicable) other contact information from us to facilitate your communications or transactions. Sometimes other Users may be able to obtain additional information about you when you use our Services to contact them or perform a transaction with them.

Our Services may include settings that enable you to choose how certain information is shared with other Users when you contact them or perform a transaction with them, as indicated when you use these Services or in your profile and account settings. Please note that other Users may have their own privacy policies that apply to their use of information, and you may wish to ask them about their policies before sharing information with them to be informed of their practices. As mentioned above, this Policy does not apply to any entity that we do not own or control, or to any person that we do not employ or manage, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.</p>
<h2 id="with-whom-do-we-share-personal-information-">With Whom do We Share Personal Information?</h2>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Under this Policy, "Personal Information" means information that by itself can be used to identify or contact a specific person (for example, a person’s name, email address, postal address or phone number), and Personal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous so that by itself, it no longer identifies and can no longer reasonably be used to contact a specific person.

<p><strong>Legal Purposes.</strong> We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and/or other information if we believe that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request (such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders), which may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside the United States; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use or our other policies or agreements with Users, or investigate potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) protect or enforce the rights or property of Artsy, you, or any other person or entity; or (v) prevent physical harm to any person, including situations involving possible violence or self-harm. </p>
<h2 id="aggregated-and-non-personal-information">Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>We may aggregate or make anonymous any Personal Information that we have obtained in any way from or about you or others so that such information no longer contains any Personal Information.

<h2 id="payment-information">Payment Information</h2>
<p>If you use our marketplace or register for certain Services, you may need to provide payment information, such as a credit card number, type and expiration date.

We do receive certain information from the payment processor, including a unique token that we associate with you to authorize your purchases, and in certain cases, the last four digits of the credit card number associated with that token, in order to help prevent fraud and identity theft. </p>
<h2 id="other-websites-and-services">Other Websites and Services</h2>
<p>Our Services may include links to other websites or services that we do not own or control, and other websites or services that we do not own or control may include links to our Services.

Our Users (including the galleries and other organizations that use our Services as exhibitors or sellers), service providers, and other third parties you may interact with in connection with our Services, may be located in the United States and other countries around the world, including countries that may not offer the same level of protection for Personal Information as that offered in the United States. By accessing or using our Services in the United States or any other country or jurisdiction, you agree that your information may be transferred and processed in the United States and any other country or jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In cases of onward transfer to third parties of Personal Information of EU individuals received pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Artsy remains accountable for the onward transfer of such Personal Information.</p>
<h2 id="children-s-information">Children’s Information</h2>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from people in this age group. If you believe we may have collected Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13, please <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">contact us</a>. </p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Every Artsy account is protected by a password to help maintain privacy and security on our Services. If you register for an account, we urge you to use a strong password containing unique numbers, letters and special characters, and to protect the confidentiality of your password at all times. If you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or password, you agree to immediately <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">notify us</a> and change your password. Please note that while we seek to protect your information and maintain the security of our Services, due to the possibility of hardware or software failure, unauthorized entry or use and other factors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information, whether online or offline. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. Please also note that any information you provide to us via email is unencrypted.</p>
<h2 id="statutory-requests">Statutory Requests</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions have laws that give people the right to access or correct their Personal Information which a company has about them. We will honor any statutory right you may have to access or correct your Personal Information that we have in our records, and you can email such requests to <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>. Once we receive your request, we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfill your request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, would require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an existing practice), would jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical to fulfill (for example, requests to access information located on backup systems). </p>
<h2 id="eu-u-s-privacy-shield">EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</h2>
<p>Artsy is a participant in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and we have certified that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>For more information about the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/privacyshield">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>As this Policy is part of our Terms of Use, any disputes involving you and us that relate to privacy or the use of your information, and that arise out of or are related to this Policy or our Services, will be subject to our Terms of Use, including any provisions regarding the limitation of damages and liability, choice of law, and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, you can also submit your complaint to Privacy Trust, an independent third party. Visit Privacy Trust’s website <a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/drs/artsy">here</a> to file a complaint. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. </p>
<h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our business changes with time, and our Privacy Policy will change also. We reserve the right to change this Policy, including our Cookie Policy, without prior notice, at any time at our sole discretion. For example, and without limitation, we may change this Policy to reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. All changes to this Policy will be effective when posted on our Services, or at such later date as may be specified in the updated Policy. We will notify you of any changes to this Policy by posting the updated Policy on our Services, and you agree to review this Policy regularly and inform yourself of all applicable changes. By continuing to use our Services after any changes to this Policy become effective, you agree to such changes and the updated Policy. Unless we notify you otherwise, the current version of this Policy will apply to all information that we have about you or your account. </p>
<h2 id="contacting-artsy">Contacting Artsy</h2>
<p>If you have questions or comments about our Privacy Policy or practices, would like to know what Personal Information we hold about you, or would like to update such Personal Information, you may contact us by email sent to <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>, or by postal mail sent to Art.sy, Inc., 401 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10013, U.S.</p>
<h1 id="cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, such as tracking URLs, to collect information about how you or others access or engage with our Services, Content, emails, and ads displayed on or off our Services, and to operate, develop, improve, and customize our Services, Content, and marketing, including ads displayed on or off our Services. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may have settings that enable you to decline or delete cookies on your device. Please note that if you decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of our Services, as some of our Services require cookies to operate.</p>
<p><strong>What these Technologies Are.</strong> “Cookies” are small data files placed on your computer or other device which record information. For example, a cookie could enable our Services to recognize your browser, while another cookie could store your account preferences and other information to help make our Services more customized. We may use two kinds of cookies, “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or are deleted. “Web beacons” (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFS”) are pieces of code or pixels embedded in a web page or email to track engagement with and responses to emails, web pages or ads, or to access or communicate with cookies. “Tracking URLs” are special URLs that can be used to track engagement with and responses to emails or web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics, Service, and Ad Providers.</strong>  We may use third-party analytics and services providers who help us to better understand how our Services and Content are accessed and used, including for web analytics, audience measurement, personalization and segmentation, and relationship management purposes. In turn, this information helps us to develop and improve our Services and Content. Our third-party analytics and service providers include but are not limited to Google Analytics and Mixpanel. These providers may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about how Users access or engage with our Services, Content, emails, and ads on or off our Services. For more information about how Google may collect and process information in connection with Google Analytics, click <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party advertising providers, including ad networks or exchanges, to help display ads on our Services or on other websites, including customized ads based on past online activity. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to help provide their services to us, and to collect information about your and others’ online activity across different websites. These providers may also collect your IP address, device identifier, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The third-party advertising providers we use include but are not limited to Google Analytics, and we use its Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting features, which enables Google Analytics to collect data about traffic on our Services through <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">Google advertising cookies</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous identifiers</a>. We and third-party providers, including Google Analytics, may use first-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by the website you are visiting) and third-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by a third-party website other than the website you are visiting) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Services. We do not control the practices of any third-party providers, and this Cookie Policy (and our Privacy Policy in general) does not cover the use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by any third parties. </p>
<p><strong>Opting-Out.</strong> Third-party providers may offer you a way to opt-out of receiving cookies from them by visiting their own websites or the websites of industry groups such as the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. For example, you may opt-out of receiving ad-related cookies from Google through its <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">Ad Settings</a>. If you opt-out of receiving cookies from one of these providers, it may place a cookie on your device to remember your preference. Accordingly, if you delete cookies, install a new browser, or start using a new device, you may need to repeat the opt-out process. We do not respond to browser-initiated “do not track” signals, as there currently is not an industry standard for responding to them. </p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Cookie Policy.</strong> As this Cookie Policy is part of our Privacy Policy, we may update it at any time as described in our Privacy Policy. Please review this Cookie Policy regularly to be informed of any updates.</p>
