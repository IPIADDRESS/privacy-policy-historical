<h3>ArticleClick.com Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>ArticleClick.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors.
  We strive to offer our visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and
  to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use personally
  identifiable information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone
  number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will NEVER sell, barter,
  or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
<p>We collect information from online visitors who ask to be on our newsletter
  mailing list and/or receive periodic email announcements. Anyone who wishes
  can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time.</p>
<p>All online visitor data collected by ArticleClick.com is protected against
  unauthorized access. We will not sell, trade, or give your personal information
  to other companies or organizations.</p>
<p>How we gather information from users:</p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services we provide.
  For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access
  to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters
  or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate
  in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
  areas of our site. Like most Web sites, ArticleClick.com also collects information
  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent
  to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
  or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit.
  Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing
  you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control
  the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information
  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
  information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,
  but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may
  be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
  customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
<p>What we do with the information we collect:</p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy
  and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
  may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance
  our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
  are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with
  our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include
  any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify
  you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on ArticleClick.com
  to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences;
  our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by ArticleClick.com
  and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information collected by ArticleClick.com may also
  be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
  troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes
  and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide
  technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for
  example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted
  by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business,
  we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
  transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also
  disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when
  we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the
  collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities
  whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide
  you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements:</p>
<p>ArticleClick.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect
  the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
  partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through
  our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
  For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part
  of a frame on a ArticleClick.com page, certain content that is actually created
  or hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticleClick.com you may be introduced
  to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
  offered by other parties. ArticleClick.com is not responsible for the actions
  or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies
  of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated
  by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
  may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences
  or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served
  by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
  on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies
  or other technology to gather information. ArticleClick.com does not control
  the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and
  is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable
  information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed
  publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge
  and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
  Such activities are beyond the control of ArticleClick.com and this policy.</p>
<p> Children's Privacy</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age
  of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age
  of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. ArticleClick.com encourages
  parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's
  online experience safer:</p>
<p>* Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent
  or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.</p>
<p>* Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</p>
<p>* Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is
  treated.</p>
