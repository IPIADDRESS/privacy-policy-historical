<p class="articletitle" align="left"><b>Your ArticleStars Directory Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p align="left">ArticleStars.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to
			provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use
			Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
			street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this
			privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email
			address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
<p align="left"><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
<p align="left">How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
			visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
			services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide
			information when you register for access to certain portions of our
			site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you
			make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
			sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other
			interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, ArticleStars.com
			also collects information automatically and through the use of
			electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For
			example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or
			use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from
			your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name
			and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
			each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
			encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
			adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through
			other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
			information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept
			cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions
			of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,
			and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to
			your preferences.</p>
<p align="left"><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
<p align="left">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your
			visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We
			respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p align="left">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
			identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
			information about your usage patterns with similar information
			obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services
			(e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are
			most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared
			with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
			does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you
			or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p align="left">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
			www.ArticleStars.com to communicate with you about your registration
			and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy
			policy; services and products offered by www.ArticleStars.com and
			other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
<p align="left">Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticleStars.com
			may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to
			site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
			transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
			communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical
			support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for
			example) may access such information. We will use your information
			only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we
			continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
			with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
			information may be among the transferred assets. We may also
			disclose your information in response to a court order, at other
			times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in
			connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
			to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
			necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
			disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
<p align="left">ArticleStars.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates
			to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
			parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
			content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
			privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example,
			during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a
			frame on a www.ArticleStars.com page, certain content that is
			actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
			ArticleStars.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
			information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by
			other parties. ArticleStars.com is not responsible for the actions
			or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable
			privacy policies of those third parties when providing information
			on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p align="left">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other
			third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to
			identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.
			For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and
			may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether
			you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
			available on our site may offer services operated by third parties
			and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
			ArticleStars.com does not control the use of this technology by
			third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible
			for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p align="left">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
			Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat
			areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected
			and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in
			unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such
			activities are beyond the control of ArticleStars and this policy.
			</p>
<p align="left"><b>Children</b></p>
<p align="left">ArticleStars.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
			Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
			permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information
			from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete
			that information immediately. If you believe ArticleStars.com has
			any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at
			the address listed below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Contacting Us</b></p>
<p align="left">We can be reached by emailing us.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p align="left">ArticleStars.com reserves the right to change this policy at any
			time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your
			continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these
			terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected
			prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the
			rules and laws that applied at the time the information was
			collected.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Governing law</b></p>
<p align="left">This policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York
			law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to
			resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the
			following location: Buffalo. Any costs and fees other than attorney
			fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of
			us.</p>
<p align="left">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
			solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to
			binding arbitration at the following location: Buffalo, under the
			rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the
			award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with
			jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p align="left">This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended
			to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on
			behalf of any party.</p>
