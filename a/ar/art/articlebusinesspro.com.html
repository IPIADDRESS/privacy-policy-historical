<p>Simply stated, here at FreeIQ.com we
hate spam as much as you do. Therefore, we will not sell, lease or
rent your e-mail address to anyone. Period.</p>
<p><br>
</p>

<p>Now for the fine print, to keep the
lawyers happy...</p>

<h2>Collection of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>In order to access some Free IQ
services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address and
password, which form the basis of your account. As part of creating
your account, you may also be requested to provide questions and
secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist
in resetting your password, as well as an alternate email address.
Finally, a unique affiliate ID number may be assigned to your account
which will be used to identify your account and associated
information.</p>
<p>To access some Free IQ products and
services we ask you to provide personal information, such as your
e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. We
may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age,
gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a
purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for
additional information, such as your credit card number and billing
address, which is used to create a Free IQ billing account.</p>
<p>We may collect information about your
visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other
actions taken in connection with Free IQ sites and services. We also
collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every
website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and
language, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
<p>When you receive newsletters, RSS
feeds, or promotional e-mail from Free IQ, we may use web beacons
(described below), customized links or similar technologies to
determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you
click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or
other information.</p>
<p>In order to offer you a more consistent
and personalized experience in your interactions with Free IQ,
information collected through one Free IQ service may be combined
with information obtained through other Free IQ services. We may also
supplement the information we collect with information obtained from
other companies. For example, we may use services from other
companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on
your IP address in order to customize certain services to your
geographic area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Free IQ collects and uses your personal
information to operate and improve its sites and deliver the services
or carry out the transactions you have requested. These uses may
include providing you with more effective customer service; making
the products or services easier to use by eliminating the need for
you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and
analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies;
and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your
interests and preferences.</p>
<p>We also use your personal information
to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service
communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, affiliate
payments, affiliate promotional opportunities, information on
technical service issues, and security announcements. We may also
occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to
inform you of other products or services available from Free IQ and
its affiliates.</p>
<p>Personal information collected on Free
IQ sites and services may be stored and processed in the United
States or any other country in which Free IQ or its affiliates,
subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a Free IQ
site or service, you consent to any such transfer of information
outside of your country. We may also aggregate personal information
(such as age) with other similar information from other users, and
share your data with other parties, as long as the information shared
with third parties is not personally identifiable to you (in other
words, kept anonymous). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sharing of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Except as described in this statement,
we will not disclose your personal information outside of Free IQ and
its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. Some
Free IQ pages allow you to choose to share your personal information
with select Free IQ partners so that they can contact you about their
products, services or offers. See the Communication Preferences
section below for more information.</p>
<p>Some Free IQ services may be co-branded
and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for
or use such services, both Free IQ and the other company may receive
information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to
provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the
processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, data
mining, ad delivery, hosting websites, processing transactions, or
performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will
be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to
deliver the service. They are required to maintain the
confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it
for any other purpose.</p>
<p>When you purchase products on Free IQ
that are sold by other providers, that provider will be supplied with
your contact information for shipping and contact purposes, and the
usage of that information will be subject to that provider's privacy
policies.</p>
<p>When you sign up to join a content
provider's mailing list, that provider will receive  your name and
email address, the usage of which will be subject to that provider's
privacy policies.</p>
<p>We may access and/or disclose your
personal information if we believe such action is necessary to: (a)
comply with the law or legal process served on Free IQ; (b) protect
and defend the rights or property of Free IQ (including the
enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to
protect the personal safety of users of Free IQ services or members
of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Accessing Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You may have the ability to view or
edit the personal information retained by Free IQ online. In order to
help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others,
you will be required to sign in with your account information
(username and password). You can access and update your profile on
FreeIQ.com by logging into your account and clicking the Personal
Info link. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Communication Preferences</h2>
<p>You can stop the delivery of future
promotional e-mail from Free IQ sites and services by following the
specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.</p>
<p>These communication choices do not
apply to mandatory service communications that are considered part of
certain Free IQ services, which you may receive periodically unless
you cancel the service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Free IQ is committed to protecting the
security of your personal information. We use a variety of security
technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store
the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited
access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit
highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or
password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of
encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<p>If a password is used to help protect
your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to
keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with
anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always
choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access
to your information from subsequent users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h2>
<p>Many Free IQ sites are intended for
general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal
information from children. When a Free IQ site does collect age
information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will
block such users from providing personal information. We will not
knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more
information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.</p>
<p>We encourage you to talk with your
children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal
information online. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
<p>Free IQ websites use "cookies"
to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your
online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on
your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that
can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
viruses to your computer.</p>
<p>Free IQ websites use cookies to store
your preferences and other information on your computer in order to
save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same
information and to display your personalized content and appropriate
advertising on your later visits to these sites.</p>
<p>When you sign in to a site using your
account, Free IQ stores your unique account information in an
encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move
from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each
page. </p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or
decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you
prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign
in or use other interactive features of Free IQ sites and services
that depend on cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use of Web Beacons</h2>
<p>Free IQ Web pages may contain
electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called
single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies
on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages
and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in
promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine
whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
<p>Free IQ may also employ Web beacons
from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics
and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We
prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to
collect or access your personal information.</p>
<p>Finally, we may work with other
companies that advertise on Free IQ sites to place Web beacons on
their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often
clicking on an advertisement on a Free IQ site results in a purchase
or other action on the advertiser's site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</h2>
<p>The majority of the online banner
advertisements you see on Free IQ Web pages are displayed by Free IQ.
However, we may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers
or ad networks, to display advertisements on Free IQ Web pages. Some
of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer
in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about
where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their
advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This
information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements
that they believe will be of most interest to you. Free IQ does not
have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad
servers or ad networks.</p>
<p>Free IQ may maintain relationships with
a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as:
Avenue A; BlueStreak; DoubleClick; Mediaplex; Pointroll; RealMedia;
TangoZebra; and Unicast. Those ad networks that use persistent
cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find
more information at the website of either the individual ad network
or the Network Advertising Initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Controlling "Spam" or Unsolicited E-mail</h2>
<p>Free IQ is concerned about controlling
unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." Free IQ has a
strict Anti-Spam Policy prohibiting the use of email addresses in our
database to send spam. Free IQ will not sell, lease or rent its
e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Enforcement of This Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>If you have questions regarding this
statement, you should contact us by <a href="feedback.dhtml">using our Web form</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Changes to This Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>We will occasionally update this
privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer
feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the
"last updated" date at the top of this statement. If there
are material changes to this statement or in how Free IQ will use
your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently
posting a notice of such changes to your login screen prior to
implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. In
case of change, you will have the ability to opt-out if you object to
the change. If you do not opt-out within 30 days of notification, the
new privacy policy changes will apply to your account as if you had
expressly opted in under the new privacy policy. We encourage you to
periodically review this statement to be informed of how Free IQ is
protecting your information.</p>
