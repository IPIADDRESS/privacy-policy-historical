  <title>Article Runner Privacy</title>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>ArticleRunner.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information
(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject
to the terms of this privacy policy. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We respect your privacy, we will
never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized
third party. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How we gather information
from users</span><br>
<br>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. <br>
For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features,
such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. <br>
<br>
You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
our site. Like most Web sites, ArticleRunner.com also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) or
use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your
visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site.<br>
<br>
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information
through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us
with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to
accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and
password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features
according to your preferences.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What we do with the
information we collect</span><br>
<br>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
and deliver more individualized content and advertising. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We respect your privacy and do
not share your information with anyone.</span><br>
<br>
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other
users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages
are visited most or what features are most attractive). <br>
<br>
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.<br>
.<br>
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
ArticleRunner.com to communicate with you about your registration
and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;
services and products offered by ArticleRunner.com and other topics
we think you might find of interest.<br>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticleRunner.com may
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications
with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the
operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access
such information. <br>
<br>
We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.<br>
<br>
We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Affiliated sites, linked
sites and advertisements</span><br>
<br>
ArticleRunner.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other
content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a
ArticleRunner.com page, certain content that is actually created or
hosted by a third party. <br>
<br>
Also, through ArticleRunner.com you may be introduced to, or be able
to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. <br>
<br>
ArticleRunner.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. <br>
<br>
You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.<br>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some
of your preferences or retrieve information about you. <br>
<br>
For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may
include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you
have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use
cookies or other technology to gather information.<br>
<br>
ArticleRunner.com does not control the use of this technology by third
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any
actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
<br>
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of ArticleRunner.com and this policy. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Children</span><br>
<br>
ArticleRunner.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from
a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
information immediately. If you believe ArticleRunner.com has any
information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the
address listed below.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes to this Policy</span><br>
<br>
ArticleRunner.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you
accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any
change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that
applied at the time the information was collected.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This
statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and
do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of
any party.<br>
