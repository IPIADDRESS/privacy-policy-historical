			<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:15px">
	AOPS INCORPORATED PRIVACY POLICY - EFFECTIVE September 5, 2017
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">
	This Privacy Policy applies to all users. Please <a href="#coppa">click here</a> for our specific information practices with
	regards to children under 13 (also provided at the end of this policy).
</p>

<p>
	We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only
	collect the information necessary to provide our services efficiently.  
</p>


<h2>
	Users using our online community or other online resources
	requiring membership
</h2>

<p>
	To post information in a forum, to use some of our online educational
	tools, or to attend online classes, you must become a member of the Art
	of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal
	information we require is your email address and a username that you select.
	The username that you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you;
	it is strongly recommended that it not be your real name, but a pseudonym.
	You will also select a password, which is needed to log on. We do ask about
	your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none
	of this information is required for membership in the Community.
</p>
<p>
	Your email address is used by us to send messages to you. We do so to
	confirm your username and password if you should forget your username
	or password. We also use your email address to assist in administering
	our web site and to help enforce our conduct rules (for example,
	people who post offensive messages in the forum can be banned). Should
	you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email
	address will be used for communication purposes for that class. We
	will not send solicitation emails collected as part of the Art of
	Problem Solving Community unless the user elects to join our mailing
	lists. Your email address will not be shared with or sold to any third
	party without your explicit consent to the effect.
</p>
<p>
	Our site has forums (message boards), private messaging, and real-time
	discussion available to its members. Please remember that any
	information that is disclosed in these areas is potentially available
	to other members and in some cases to the general public. You should
	not disclose any personal information, such as your real name,
	address, telephone number, email address, etc. Your username is the
	only identity that you need to have, and that is how people should
	know you on our site.
</p>
<p>
	We may disclose data we collect from Community members to a third party
	for educational research, business, and other purposes. Such data will never contain any
	personally identifiable information, and will not allow a third party to identify any
	individual user.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
	A "cookie" is a small piece of data placed on your computer by us.
	Within your web browser, cookies placed by our website can only be
	accessed by our website. We use cookies to 
	maintain session and preference information to improve the use of the website.
	We do not use cookies to target advertisements to specific users. You may set
	your web browser to decline our
	cookies, however this will render large portions of our website
	unusable.
</p>
<p>
	We also allow cookies to be placed on your computer by third parties
	for the purpose of website analytics. This allows the third parties to
	collect data about your use of our website. The data collected by these cookies may include
	information such as your IP address or mobile identifier, the type of
	computer operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the
	user visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information
	regarding the online or mobile service provider. This data is not used to target
	advertisements to specific users. We don't share the data that a
	third party collects with anyone besides that third party. 
	The third parties are required to not share any personally identifiable
	information they may collect with anyone other than us (except as may be
	required by law). We use the data that is collected in the following
	ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		to report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use
		our website;
	</li>
	<li>
		to understand overall visitor behavior; and
	</li>
	<li>
		to inform how we update and improve our website.
	</li>
</ul>



<h2>Teachers using our Teacher Tools</h2>
<p>
	Teachers using our Teacher Tools on our website must first be
	members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We collect certain
	additional information from teachers wishing to use the Teacher
	Tools. We collect: your name, your school's name and address, a
	contact phone number and email address, and your school's website URL.
	We use this information to verify that you are a teacher at a
	legitimate educational institution or homeschool, and to contact you
	regarding the Teacher Tools. We may request from you other proof of
	school affiliation, as necessary, to determine your eligibility to use
	our Teacher Tools. We will not share this information with any third
	party (except as may be required by law).
</p>
<p>
	Teachers may enroll
	students in their classes using the Teacher Tools. In the case
	that such a student is under the age of 13, teachers agree that they,
	or their school, are acting as the students' parents' agent in
	providing consent for the online collection of students' personal
	information within the school context. (Please see
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools">
		this website from the Federal Trade Commission</a>
	for more information.) Please note that we will only use children's
	information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>
	Students enrolling in a class within his or her
	school, established by a registered teacher using our Teacher Tools
</h2>
<p>
	Students who enroll in a class set up by a registered teacher
	using our Teacher Tools 
	do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We
	will collect your name, and you will also have to choose a unique
	username and password, which are both needed to log on. (If you are
	already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
	your already-existing username and password, but you may have to
	additionally provide your real name.) Your real name and username,
	along with other data that we have collected including (but not
	necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our
	Alcumus online educational system, will be shared with the teacher in
	whose class you are enrolling. We will not use this information for any other purpose,
	and will not share this information with any other third party (except
	as may be required by law). Please note that we will only use children's
	information we collect with the school's consent for educational purposes.
</p>

<h2>Customers purchasing a product or service</h2>

<p>
	We collect certain information from a customer who is purchasing a
	product and/or service using our online ordering system. Such
	information may include: your name, your shipping address, your
	billing address, your credit card information, your email address, and
	your phone number. This information is used to process your purchase
	and to contact you if there is an issue with your purchase. We will
	share this information with our credit card payment processor.
	Additionally, your name, shipping address, email address, and/or phone
	number may be shared with the United States Postal Service or other
	private carrier, for the purpose of delivering any purchased goods to
	your shipping address. We will store all of this information on our
	secure server, except for your credit card information, which is only
	retained until your payment has been processed and is not stored
	thereafter; however, this information may be retained by our credit
	card processor for the purpose of processing additional transactions,
	refunds, and/or chargebacks. We
	will not use this information for any purpose other than to process
	your purchase, and will not share this information with any other
	third party, except as described above or as may be required by law.
	We may use your email address for marketing purposes, but only if you
	give your permission to do so during the purchasing process, and such
	permission may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us (via the
	methods listed under "Contact Information" below).
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
	We implement commercially reasonable security methods to protect the
	information we collect from you. While the security of your personal
	information is of the utmost importance to us, we cannot absolutely
	guarantee the security of any information you choose to disclose.
</p>

<h2>Effective date and notice of future changes</h2>

<p>
	This Privacy Policy is effective September 5, 2017. This Privacy Policy
	may be updated from time to time as necessary.
</p>

<a name="coppa"></a>

<h1>COPPA Policy</h1>

<p>
	The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires
	that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use,
	or disclosure of personal information from children under the age of 13, and to
	obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any
	such information. If we discover we have collected information from a child in a
	manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either seek the parent's
	consent for that collection or delete the information. We won't require a child
	to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an
	activity.
</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect and share</h2>

<p>
	When we use the term "children" or "child", it refers to individuals under the age
	of 13. We may collect and share the following personal information with verifiable
	parental consent (where necessary under COPPA) from children:
</p>

<p>
	(a) Children may provide us their email address during registration or as part of
	receiving our services. We may use this email address to communicate directly with the
	child. This email address is never made available to any other user of
	the site, nor to any third party.
</p>

<p>
	(b) A username used to uniquely identify each child is created during 
	registration. This username may be
	disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online
	classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may
	participate. Other members of the website may use the child's
	username to directly contact the child (for example, by private
	message or in online classroom discussions).
</p>

<p>
	(c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name.
	The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be
	disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific
	authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has
	requested access from the child to view the child's online school
	reports. Such third parties must request permission from us before
	they request this information from the child, and we make a
	reasonable effort to determine if the third party has your consent and their request is
	legitimate before granting such permission. The child's real name
	will never be made publicly available on our website by us.
</p>

<p>
	(d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's
	participation on the website; for example, online homework submissions,
	live classroom discussions, etc. These data may be combined or associated
	with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site, at
	the child's or parent's discretion.
</p>

<p>
	(e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal
	information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on
	a blog or in our online classroom). Such information may be publicly
	displayed on the website alongside the child's username. We strongly discourage
	users from sharing personal information, but we cannot prevent it in every
	instance. This policy addresses how parents can delete information posted by
	their children in item #2 below.
</p>

<p>
	(f)  When children use our websites, certain information may automatically be
	collected by third parties: IP address or mobile identifier, the type of computer
	operating system, the web browser, the frequency with which the user visits
	various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online
	or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such
	as cookies, which are described above.
</p>

<p>
	This data is primarily collected and shared with third parties for internal 
	purposes, in order to: 
</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>
		report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use our website;
		</li>
		<li>
		understand overall visitor behavior; and
		</li>
		<li>
		inform how we update and improve our website.
		</li>
	</ul>
	The third-party operators who may collect information for these purposes 
	on our sites and applications are Alphabet Inc., Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.com, Inc.  This information
	is not used to target advertising to specific users. For any questions about how we or any
	third-party uses your data, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Our contact information
	is provided below in item #3.
<p></p>
<p>
	(g) We may disclose a child’s personal information if permitted or required by law, for
	example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.
</p>
<p>
	(h) We generally do not collect personal information from a child until we have received
	verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA. There are limited instances where we
	may collect information without parental consent in compliance with COPPA, including:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		An email address is collected from a child at the time of registration, solely to 
		contact the child's parent in order to obtain the necessary parental consent; 
		</li>
		<li>
		To protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology; and
		</li>
		<li>
		A username is selected by the child; however, this username cannot be used to contact 
		the child, nor be used for the purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of above, unless
		and until we receive verifiable parental consent.
	</li></ul>

<p></p>

<h2>2. Parental rights and responsibilities</h2>
<ol class="part2" type="a">
	
	<li>
		At any time, a parent can review or ask us to delete a child's
		personal information, or can refuse to permit its further collection
		or use, by contacting us by any of the means listed in item #3 below.
	</li>
	<li>
		Parents may also access their child’s personal information by logging
		onto their account and can delete their child’s personal information.  Parents
		will need their child’s username and password, and our login page explains how
		parents can recover a username or password if they cannot recall this information. 
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Contact information</h2>

<p>
	Questions or comments about this policy, or requests pursuant
	to item #2 above, may be sent to:
