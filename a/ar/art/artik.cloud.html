                <h2>SAMSUNG ARTIK CLOUD™ PLATFORM PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                <p>
                Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Samsung," "we," "us," "our") know how important privacy is to our customers, and we strive to be clear about how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information.  This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") provides an overview of our information practices.  The Privacy Policy applies to (i) the SAMSUNG ARTIK CLOUD™ Platform, a platform operated by Samsung that enables mobile devices and applications to upload information, (ii) the following SAMSUNG ARTIK CLOUD™ websites:  <a target="_blank" href="https://artik.cloud">https://artik.cloud</a> (the "User Portal"), <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.artik.cloud">https://developer.artik.cloud</a>  (the "Developer Portal"), <a target="_blank" href="https://trials-admin.artik.cloud">https://trials-admin.artik.cloud</a> (the "Trial Tool Administrator Site") and <a target="_blank" href="https://trials.artik.cloud">https://trials.artik.cloud</a> (the "Trial Tool Participant Site"),  and (iii) any Samsung device, website or online application that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Platform").  This Privacy Policy does not address personal information that you provide to us in other contexts (e.g., through a business relationship not related to the Platform).
                </p>
                <p>
                Please note that this Privacy Policy applies regardless of whether you use a computer, mobile phone, tablet, TV, or other device to access the Platform.  It is important that you read the Privacy Policy carefully because anytime you use the Platform, you consent to the practices we describe in the Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the practices described in the Privacy Policy, you should not use the Platform or click on the "I Agree" button (if available).
                </p>
                <h3>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</h3>
                <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers how Samsung treats personally identifiable information that it collects and receives through the Platform.  "Personal Information" means information about you that is personally identifiable or from which you can be identified together with other information(e.g., your name, address, email address or phone number).
                </p>
                <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</h3>
                <p>
                We do not collect Personal Information about you through the Platform without your knowledge or action.  We use Personal Information that we collect to (i) provide the Platform services you request; (ii) understand the way you use the Platform services so that we can improve your experience; (iii) comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and our legitimate business interests; and (iv) offer you products or services we consider may be of interest to you or for other marketing purposes. Your information is collected and used in the following ways through the Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>The Platform.</b>  Samsung operates the Platform, which offers an interface that allows cloud-based services to store and exchange data from diverse devices.  The Platform exposes application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable developers to store or read data from devices, services and mobile applications.  The Personal Information collected through the APIs and hosted on the Platform's cloud servers may include, but is not limited to, name, credit card information, and other demographic information of the user and biometric health data recorded by the third party service, or a device.  The Personal Information collected through the Platform is used to offer the Platform's services.  Personal Information stored through the Platform may include medical information if a user has chosen to store such information. The Personal Information is transferred to the United States (where privacy laws may not be as adequate as in the jurisdiction in which you are based if outside the United States) to Samsung and third parties engaged by Samsung to enable us to operate the Platform or provide a service to you. By using the Platform you expressly agree to the transfer of the Personal Information to the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Platform Websites.</b>  Samsung offers various products and services on websites associated with the Platform, including the User Portal, the Developer Portal, the Trial Tool Administrator Site and the Trial Tool Site.  Personal Information is collected through the registration forms of the Platform websites, and may include, but is not limited to, name, phone number, fax number, email address and, if applicable, credit card information.  The Personal Information collected through the Platform websites is used to offer the particular products and services available through the Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Information About Your Use of the Platform.</b>   In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of the Platform, such as the applications and devices you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Platform service.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Other Information We Collect.</b>  We also may collect other information about you, your device(s), or your use of the Platform in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Protected Health Information Subject to HIPAA.</b>  When Samsung provides the Platform to certain healthcare providers, health plans and other healthcare organizations, Samsung may be subject to federal healthcare privacy and security standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") or equivalent provisions protecting sensitive personal data under other applicable laws.  To the extent that the Personal Information provided to Samsung is "protected health information" subject to HIPAA or sensitive personal data subject to equivalent provisions in other applicable laws, Samsung will safeguard the privacy and security of that information in accordance with applicable HIPAA or other applicable legal requirements.
                </p>
                <h3>TO WHOM DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>
                Except as described below and in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information to any third parties without your consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Disclosures to Certain Third Parties.</b>  We may disclose your Personal Information to our subcontractors, agents, or payment service providers (who may be located in the United States) that we contract with to assist us in providing the Platform; provided that any such subcontractors or agents shall agree in writing to comply with the privacy and security standards described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Disclosures Under Special Circumstances.</b>  There may be instances when we disclose your Personal Information to other parties:
                </p><ul>
                <li>to comply with the law or respond to compulsory legal process (such as a search warrant or court order) or request for information from a regulator;</li>
                <li>to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Platform; or</li>
                <li>to protect the rights, property or safety of Samsung, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, or customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                <b>Other Parties in Connection With Corporate Transactions.</b>  We may share your Personal Information with other business entities in connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of Samsung's business to that business entity.  We will require any such successor business entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Other Parties With Your Consent or At Your Direction.</b>  In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when you consent to or request such sharing.
                </p>
                <h3>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION AND ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>
                <b>Aggregated Data.</b>  Samsung collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and also counts, tracks, and aggregates the visitor's activity into Samsung's analysis of general traffic-flow through the Platform.  To these ends, Samsung may merge information about you into aggregated group data.  In some cases, Samsung may remove personal identifiers from Personal Information and maintain it in aggregate form that may later be combined with other information to generate anonymous, aggregated statistical information. Such anonymous, group data may be shared on an aggregated basis with Samsung's affiliates, business partners, service providers and/or vendors; if it does so, Samsung will not disclose your individual identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Web Server Logs and IP Addresses.</b>  An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that automatically identifies the computer/machine you have used to access the Internet. The IP address enables our server to send you the web pages that you want to visit, and it may disclose the server owned by your Internet Service Provider. Samsung may use IP addresses to conduct website analyses and performance reviews and to administer the Platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Cookies, Beacons and Similar Technologies.</b>  We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Cookies.</b>  Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:
                </p><ul>
                <li>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don't have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.</li>

                <b>Other Local Storage.</b>  We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.

                <b>Beacons.</b>  We also may use technologies called beacons (or "pixels") that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We may use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of the Platform and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content that is more relevant to you.

                <h3>SECURITY</h3>
                <p>
                Samsung understands that storing data in a secure manner is essential. Samsung stores Personal Information and other data using reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to secure data against foreseeable risks, such as unauthorized use, access, disclosure, destruction or modification.  Although we make good faith efforts to store the information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Further, while we work to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
                </p>
                <h3>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
                <p>
                Our Platform services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control.  We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by such websites or other services.  You should exercise caution, and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.
                We also make available to you certain products or services (e.g., apps available through the Platform) developed by third parties.  Samsung is not responsible for these third-party products or services.
                </p>
                <h3>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECTION</h3>
                <h4>Under Age 13</h4>
                <p>
                We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.
                </p>
                <h4>Under Age 18</h4>
                <p>
                Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Information that they have provided to Samsung while using the Platform deleted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@artik.cloud">privacy@artik.cloud</a> requesting deletion.  Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems.
                </p>
                <h3>DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS AND SIMILAR MECHANISMS</h3>
                <p>
                Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates, although web browsers incorporate and activate this functionality in different ways, and it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted. There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Samsung currently does not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.
                </p>
                <h3>CORRECTING, UPDATING OR DELETING INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>
                The Platform gives users the option to correct, update or delete information previously provided to us by the user; however, we will maintain copies of user information to the extent retained as part of the Platform's standard backup/archive process or required by law or regulatory requirements and subject to our legal obligations.
