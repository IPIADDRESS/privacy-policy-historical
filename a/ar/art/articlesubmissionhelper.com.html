<p>This site is owned and operated by ArticleSubmissionHelper.com. Your   privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com, we want to make your experience online   satisfying and safe.</p>
<p>Because we gather certain types of   information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our   policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of   that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we   gather and how we use it.</p>
<h2>Information ArticleSubmissionHelper.com Gathers And Tracks</h2>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com gathers two types of information about users:<br>
  Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.   These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters,   to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and   from participation in polls and surveys:</p>
<p>Information   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com gathers through aggregated tracking   information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites.   This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers'   needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the   demographics of our audience. Because ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing   such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service   free to users. Under no circumstances does ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.</p>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
<p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Forums policy
        <p>Users   of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for   these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages,   although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration   the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Polling
      <p>We   may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their   opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about   important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated   and are not identifiable to any particular user.   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com may use a system to "tag" users after they   have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This   tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Surveys
      <p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to   our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information   in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never   share any of this information about specific individuals with any third   party.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Consistent with the Federal   Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never   knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under   the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>
<h2>Usage Tracking</h2>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we   do not correlate this information with data about individual users.   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com does break down overall usage statistics   according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by   reading this information from the browser string (information contained   in every user's browser).</p>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com sometimes   tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search   function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.   We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users   like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track   what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs   overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We   may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your   computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information   although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to   information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the   only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply   yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie   files created by other sites. ArticleSubmissionHelper.com uses cookies   to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising   system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and   click rates.</p>
<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your   browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting   cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do   not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do   need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling   and surveys.</p>
<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their   experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or   personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content   based on the interests of our users.</p>
<p>As stated above, we use   information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out   electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,   surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to   subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and   occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might   be particularly interested in something we are doing.   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com never shares newsletter mailing lists with   any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
<p>When   we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users   like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track   what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs   overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We   track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of   what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular   user enters.</p>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com creates aggregate reports   on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and   partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,   and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to   their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual   users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user   clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any   individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal   process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
<h2>Sharing of the Information</h2>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your   needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's   demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We will not   share information about individual users with any third party, except   to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the   personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>ArticleSubmissionHelper.com   operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall   and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are   periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized   individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.</p>
<h2>Opt-out Policy</h2>
<p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters.</li>
  <li>Opting   not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely   alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information   from our users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using this site, you   consent to the collection and use of this information by   ArticleSubmissionHelper.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy,   we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of   what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances   we disclose it.</p>
