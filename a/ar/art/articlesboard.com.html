<p class="articletitle"><b><u>Articles Board Privacy Policy</u></b></p>

<p>ArticlesBoard.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information
(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject
to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or
rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>

<p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>

<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
our site. Like most Web sites, ArticlesBoard.com also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize
you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having
to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather
information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not
to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features
according to your preferences.</p>

<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>

<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your
visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We
respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>

<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained
from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn
which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.</p>

<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.ArticlesBoard.com to communicate with you about your
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
privacy policy; services and products offered by www.ArticlesBoard.com and other topics we think you might find of
interest.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticlesBoard.com may also be used for other purposes, including but
not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of
e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests,
and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide
technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting
service for example) may access such information. We will use your
information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner
with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose
your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with
the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note
we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>

<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>

<p>ArticlesBoard.com expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that
third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and
other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during
your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a www.ArticlesBoard.com page, certain content that is actually created
or hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticlesBoard.com you may
be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites,
features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. ArticlesBoard.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of
those third parties when providing information on a feature or page
operated by a third party.</p>

<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other
third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to
identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.
For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may
include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you
have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use
cookies or other technology to gather information. ArticlesBoard.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the
resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or
policies of such third parties.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of ArticlesBoard.com and this policy.
</p><p><b>Children</b></p>

<p>ArticlesBoard.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13
except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any
information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will
delete that information immediately. If you believe ArticlesBoard.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,
please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p><b>Contacting Us</b></p>

<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>

<p>ArticlesBoard.com reserves the right to change this policy at any
time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued
use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will
mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time
any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that
applied at the time the information was collected.</p>

<p><b>Governing law</b></p>

dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it
with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following
location: kerala. Any costs and fees other than lawyer fees
associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>

solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding

of any party.</p>
