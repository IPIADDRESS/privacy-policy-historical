			<h4 class="textPageTitle">Privacy Policy</h4>
		
			<p class="textNormal">
			At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting every User's privacy. We use the information we collect
			to process orders and to provide a more personalized service. Artsonia's privacy policy, described below, 
			is designed to use the information we collect about visitors with utmost care and responsibility.
			</p>

			<hr size="1" noshade="" color="#CCCCCC" style="border:1px #CCCCCC dashed;">

			<p class="textNormal"><b>1. Information Provided By All Users of the Website</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			The information Users provide to Artsonia through the website is used to process orders, to provide
			enhanced and more personalized service, and to properly index and display
			artwork. The data in Artsonia's databases is protected against unauthorized
			access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software.
			</p>

			<p class="textNormal">
			The information Users provide to Artsonia is for internal business use only by Artsonia. We do not
			sell this information to anyone.
			</p>
		
			<p class="textNormal">
			Personally identifying information that Users provide upon registration as a member of an artist's fan
			club may be revealed to the artist's parents but not to any other third parties.
			The first name and relationship to the artist may be posted alongside the
			artwork to enable artists and parents to see who all have joined the fan club
			and have seen the artwork.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is
			necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply the terms of Artsonia's user
			agreements or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, the users
			or others.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>2. Information Provided By Teachers</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Teachers who wish to display their students' artwork on Artsonia are required to register as members. The
			information provided during the registration process is used to communicate
			with the Teacher as well as to create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will
			list the Teacher name and the name of the school. Teachers should be aware that
			the personal information about themselves - the name and school - is posted on
			the website and publicly accessible to all users of the website and could be
			collected and disclosed by others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such
			collection or disclosure. Artsonia does, however keep all Teachers emails
			completely private (emails are never posted on the website) and does not sell
			this list to anyone.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			To organize artwork, teachers input first and last names of students in a secured teacher roster.
			The first and last names are entered in separate fields, and unique screennames
			are then generated for each student, based on the entry in the first name
			field. It is the Teacher's responsibility to ensure that only the first names
			are added in the first name field. Artsonia cannot be held responsible for
			Teachers entering last names or any other identifying information in the first
			name field. The information in the last name field is never posted publicly on
			Artsonia, and both the first and last names will never be divulged to any third
			party. Artsonia does not sell or barter any identifying information about
			students to any third parties.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>3. Information Provided by Kids (Children Under 18)</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Kids who wish to display their artwork on Artsonia are required to register with Artsonia.
			Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information from kids than is
			absolutely necessary. During the registration process we ask for the following
			information: the kid's first and last names (these enable Artsonia to generate
			a unique screenname for each kid), grade and country of residence (these enable
			Artsonia to index the artwork under grade-based and country-based galleries), a
			title for the artwork (which is displayed with the artwork) and a parent's
			email address. Artsonia sends the parent an email notifying that their
			son/daughter has registered with Artsonia with the intention of displaying
			his/her artwork on the Artsonia website. If parental consent is not received
			within two weeks, all information about the kid is deleted from Artsonia's
			records and the kid's registration is cancelled. Further, every time a kid
			uploads any piece of artwork to Artsonia, the parent is informed by email. If
			parental consent is not received within two weeks, that artwork and its title
			are removed from Artsonia's databases. In no event will Artsonia display an
			artwork uploaded by a kid without first receiving consent from one of his/her
			parents.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li class="textNormal">
					We DO NOT collect online contact information from kids without parental
					notification, which will include an opportunity to suspend participation in the
					activity.
				</li>
				<li class="textNormal">
					We DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from kids.
				</li>
				<li class="textNormal">
					We DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from kids.
				</li>
				<li class="textNormal">
					We DO NOT publicly post identifiable information collected from kids without first
					obtaining parental consent.
				</li>
				<li class="textNormal">
					We DO NOT require a kid to provide Artsonia with more information than is
					reasonably necessary to participate as a condition of participation.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Kids under 13 years of age are not allowed to register for Artsonia fan clubs and kids under 18 are
			not allowed to purchase any products from Artsonia.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			If a Parent of a kid under 18 wants Artsonia to remove their kid's artwork that has already been
			published on the website (either by the kid with the parent's permission or by
			the kid's school), the Parent can request that the artwork and all information
			about the kid be removed from Artsonia's records. Parent need to compose and
			mail a signed letter to the address noted below indicating the kid's screenname
			and the artid(s) of the artwork(s) that the Parent wants removed.

			<p class="textNormal"><b>4. Identifying Information About Artists</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the artists showcasing their work on
			Artsonia. These artists will be identified only by their screenname (which is
			often, but not necessarily, the artist's first name and a numerical suffix).
			Artsonia does not post the full name, mailing address or email address of
			artists on its website. There is no way for the visitors of the website to
			directly and privately contact the artists based on a screenname.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			However, if the artist has signed his/her full name as part of the artwork image, or if the submitter
			erroneously entered the last name of the artist in the first name textbox
			field, Artsonia cannot take responsibility for any damages incurred due to the
			negligence of the submitter of the artwork. We strongly encourage teachers and
			parents to submit artwork and/or digital images of artwork where the artist's
			last name (if it exists in the artwork) has been removed, erased or covered. We
			strongly encourage teachers and parents to verify that only the first name is
			entered in the first name field when submitting artwork.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>5. Information Posted Publicly on Artsonia</b></p>

			<p class="textNormal">
			Users should be aware that any personal information - such as name or school - that is posted on
			Artsonia is accessible to other users of the website and could be collected and
			disclosed by others. (For example, if a User leaves a comment for an artist).
			Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure. We
			strongly discourage users from using personally identifying information in
			comments that they leave for artists. Specifically we encourage parents who
			approve the comments to erase all email addresses and last names.
			</p>

			<p class="textNormal"><b>6. eCards (Electronic Greeting Cards)</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			When a User sends an electronic greeting card through Artsonia, an email is sent to the recipient on
			the User's behalf. Artsonia's policy is to respect the privacy and
			confidentiality of the content of the electronic greeting cards sent. Artsonia
			does not sell, barter or exchange email addresses provided when sending an
			electronic greeting card.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>7. Cookies</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Cookies are small text files that Artsonia writes to a User's computer to make it easier for the User
			navigate within the website. Artsonia cookies do not contain any personally
			identifying information such as passwords. Visitors to Artsonia have the option
			of disabling cookies via browser preferences. However, if cookies are disabled,
			some features of Artsonia may not function properly.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>8. Aggregate Statistics</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Artsonia may report aggregate statistics about visitors, traffic patterns, electronic postcard
			usage and related site information to partners, sponsors, advertisers,
			subsidiaries, affiliates and other reputed third parties, but these statistics
			do not include any personally identifying information.
			</p>
			
			<p class="textNormal"><b>9. Choice / Opt-Out</b></p>
			
			<p class="textNormal">
			Artsonia provides Users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving any future communications
			from Artsonia and its partners at any time. If a User wants to remove their
			information from Artsonia's database and not receive future communications,
			please contact Artsonia at <a href="mailto:info@artsonia.com">info@artsonia.com</a>.
