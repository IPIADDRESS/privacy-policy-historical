<h4 class="textPageTitle">Privacy Policy</h4>

<p class="textNormal">
At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting every User's privacy.  
We use the information we collect to process orders and to provide a more personalized service.  
Artsonia's privacy policy, set forth below, is designed to use the information we collect about visitors with 
the utmost care and responsibility.
</p>

<hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" color="#cccccc" style="border:1px #CCCCCC dashed;">

<p class="textNormal"><b>1. Information Provided By All Users of the Website</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">The information Users (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use) provide to Artsonia through Artsonia.com (the "Website") is used to process orders, to provide enhanced and more personalized service, and to properly index and display artwork, lesson plans / lesson plan starters, and other materials.  The data in Artsonia's databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software.</p>
<p class="textNormal">The information Users provide to Artsonia is solely for Artsonia's internal business use.  We do not sell this information to anyone.</p>
<p class="textNormal">Personally identifiable information that Users provide upon registration as a member of the fan club of an Artist (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use) may be revealed to the Artist's Parent (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use) but not to any third parties.  The first name (that is, whatever name a member types into the "first name" field in the fan club enrollment) and relationship to the Artist may be posted alongside artwork to enable Artists and Parents to see all who have joined the fan club and seen the artwork.</p>
<p class="textNormal">Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply the terms of Artsonia's user agreements (including without limitation the Terms and Conditions of Use) or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, its Users or others.</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>2. Information Provided By Teachers</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Any Teacher (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use) who wishes to display their students' artwork or their lesson plan starters on Artsonia is required to register as a member.  The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the Teacher as well as to create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will list the Teacher name and the name of the school.  Teachers should be aware that, because personal information about themselves (i.e., their name and school) is posted on the Website and is publicly accessible to all users of the Website, that information could be collected, used, and disclosed by others.  Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information.  Artsonia does, however, keep all Teachers' email addresses completely private (emails are not posted on the Website) and does not sell this list to anyone.</p>
<p class="textNormal">The following conditions also apply to Teachers that choose to upload class artwork:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="textNormal">To organize artwork, Teachers input first and (optionally) last names of students in a secured Teacher roster.  The first and last names are entered in separate fields, and unique screen names are then generated for each student, based on the entry in the first name field.</li>
	<li class="textNormal">It is the Teacher's responsibility to ensure that only the first names are added in the first name field.  Artsonia is not responsible if a Teacher types last names or any other personally identifiable information about a child into the first name field.</li>
	<li class="textNormal">The information typed into the last name field is not posted publicly on the Website (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use).  It is used as a means to organize the roster for the Teacher's benefit only, and can only be accessed within the secure Teacher section.</li>
</ul>

<p class="textNormal"><b>3. Information Provided By Parents</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Parents who are interested in displaying their child's artwork on Artsonia are required to register as members.  The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the Parent as well as to create an Artist gallery on Artsonia.  Parents should be aware that, because the information the Parent types in the first name field textbox when registering is posted on the Website and is publicly accessible to all users of the Website, that information could be collected, used, and disclosed by others.  Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information.  Artsonia does, however, keep all Parent last names, email addresses and physical addresses completely private (that is, not posted on the Website), and does not sell this information to anyone.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="textNormal">To create an Artist gallery, Parents type the first and last name of their child into the appropriate textboxes.  The first and last names are entered in separate fields, and a unique screen name is then generated for the child Artist, based on the text typed into the first name field.  </li>
	<li class="textNormal">It is the Parent's responsibility to ensure that only the first name is typed into the first name field.  Artsonia is not responsible if a Parent types a last name or any other personally identifiable information about their child into the first name field.</li>
	<li class="textNormal">The information in the last name field is not posted publicly on the Website.</li>
	<li class="textNormal">In addition, as part of the Parent account creation process, Artsonia records the IP address used to register and agree to Artsonia Terms &amp; Conditions of Use.</li>
</ul>

<p class="textNormal"><b>4. Information Provided by Kids (Children Under 18)</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Artsonia is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.  Our information collection practices are described below.  Artsonia urges kids to check with their Parents before entering information on any Website, and we urge Parents to discuss with their kids the potential danger of revealing personal information to anyone they don't know.</p>
<p class="textNormal">Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information from kids than is absolutely necessary.  Leaving a comment for an Artist and joining an Artist's fan club are the only two activities that require Artsonia to collect information from any child under 18.</p>
<ul>
	<li class="textNormal">We DO NOT publicly post children's' email addresses (which are given to us when children sign up for a fan club).</li>
	<li class="textNormal">We DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from kids.</li>
	<li class="textNormal">We DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from kids.</li>
</ul>
<p class="textNormal"><b>Artwork Submission:</b>  Persons under 18 may NOT submit any artwork for publication.  Only Parents and Teachers are allowed to submit the artwork of those under 18.</p>
<p class="textNormal"><b>Fan Club Membership:</b>  Fan club members receive email alerts when an Artist for which they are a fan club member publishes new artwork or receives a comment, and the first name of the fan club member is publicly listed in the Artist's gallery.  Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to join another Artist's fan club.  When joining a fan club, Artsonia asks for the child's first name, their relationship to the Artist (i.e. friend, cousin, brother, sister), their email address and their Parent's email address.  Upon joining the fan club, the Parent is sent an email announcing their child's fan club membership and is given a simple opt-out unsubscribe option.  If the Parent unsubscribes, then the child's fan club registration is deleted.</p>
<p class="textNormal"><b>Comments:</b>  Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to leave a comment for another Artist.  However, if the person who submits a comment is under 13 years old, we require that a Parent's email address be provided.  When posting the comment on the Website, Artsonia sends an email alert to the email address of the commenting child's Parent that includes the comment itself and directions to delete it should the Parent desire to do so.  In addition, the comment is not posted until the Parent of the Artist who is receiving the comment officially approves it.  Artsonia sends an email to the Artist's Parent alerting them of a new comment, and the comment is not posted publicly until that Parent views and approves the comment for posting.  In other words, when a child under 13 leaves a comment for another child, the Parent of the commenter is alerted via email with an option to delete the comment, AND the Parent of the Artist that received the comment is alerted via email to approve and post the comment.</p>
<p class="textNormal"><b>Artist Statements:</b> Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to leave an Artist statement about their artwork. However, they can only do so via the Parent who has logged in to their Parents login area. Therefore, it is the Parent's responsibility to ensure the statement is appropriate and does not contain last names or contact information.</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>5. Personally Identifiable Information About Artists</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the Artists showcasing their work on Artsonia.  Artists will be identified only by their screen name (which often but not necessarily consists of the Artist's first name and a numerical suffix).  Artsonia does not knowingly post the full name, mailing address or email address of Artists on its Website.</p>
<p class="textNormal">As noted above, we require that Teachers and Parents only type the first name of the Artist into the first name field when submitting artwork.  We also require that Teachers and Parents remove, erase or cover any appearance of the Artist's last name on the artwork and/or digital images of artwork itself before submitting it to the Website.  Artsonia is not responsible for any damages resulting directly or indirectly from the negligence of the submitter of the artwork, including if the submitter erroneously typed the last name of the Artist into the first name textbox, or if the Artist has listed his or her full name as part of the artwork image and that artwork is submitted to Artsonia.</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>6. Information Posted Publicly on Artsonia</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Users should be aware that any personal information (including names of persons or schools) that is posted on Artsonia by Users is accessible to other Users of the Website and could be collected, used, and disclosed by others.  For example, if a User includes his or her full name or the name of a school in a comment for an Artist, then once that comment is approved, that information would be accessible to all Users of the Website.  Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information provided in comments approved for posting.  We strongly discourage Users from including personally identifiable information in comments that they leave for Artists.  Specifically, we encourage Parents to erase all email addresses and last names from comments for their child that they approve for posting to the Website.</p>



<p class="textNormal"><b>7. Cookies</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Cookies are small text files that Artsonia writes to a User's computer to make it easier for the User to navigate within the Website.  Artsonia cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as passwords.  Visitors to the Website have the option of disabling cookies via browser preferences.  However, if cookies are disabled, some features of the Website may not function properly.</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>8. Aggregate Statistics</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Artsonia may report aggregate statistics about visitors, traffic patterns, electronic postcard usage and related site information to partners, sponsors, advertisers, subsidiaries, affiliates and other third parties, but these statistics do not include any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>9. Choice/Opt-Out</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">Artsonia provides Users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving any future communications from Artsonia and its partners at any time.  If a User wants to remove their information from Artsonia's database and not receive future communications, please contact Artsonia at <a href="mailto:info@artsonia.com">info@artsonia.com</a>.</p>
