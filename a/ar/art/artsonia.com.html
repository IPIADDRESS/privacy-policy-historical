			<p>We want to ensure you know what data we collect and how we use it. We want users to fully understand and make informed decisions with regards to the information they share with us. In addition, we made a <a href="https://artsoniablob.blob.core.windows.net/videos/Student-Privacy-20180821.mp4">short video</a> for students highlighting  the most important details in our Privacy Policy in a format they can understand. </p>
			<p>You should read this policy in <a href="#FullPolicy">full</a>, but here are a few key points:</p>
			<p><b>Personal Data We Collect:</b> Please see <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006768294">this chart</a> for the detailed categories of information we collect from each user type as well as <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424973">this chart</a> for more detail on our mobile app permission and our <a href="tracking.asp">Online Tracking Technologies Policy</a>. You can also find more details <a href="#ProtectChildrensPII">below</a>.</p>
			<p><b>How We Use the Information We Collect:</b> We use the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> we collect from students (or about students from teachers) to provide and improve the Service, for <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006764014">educational</a>, security, and safety purposes, or as required by law. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. See <a href="#ProtectChildrensPII">here</a> for more information on our use of information collected from students, and <a href="#InfoUsed">here</a> for additional information on our use of information collected from teachers, parents and other non-student users.</p>
			<p><b>Data Retention:</b> We will not retain student <a href="https://artsonia.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> for any longer than is necessary for <a href="https://artsonia.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/360006764014">educational purposes</a> and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. Additionally, we will delete personal information associated with student accounts if they are <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000673693">inactive</a>. Note, however, some content within a student account, such as Artwork, will be kept after deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of "education records" under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)). We store non-student user <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Service to you and others. For non-student users, personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000726294">deleted</a> or until we no longer need the data to provide the Service, whichever occurs first. <a href="#DataRetention">Click here</a> for more details on Data Retention.</p>
			<p><b>What Student Information is Shown Publicly?</b> No child can upload Artwork (and the associated title and statement) unless the child's teacher is utilizing the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature and <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> is obtained by either a) having Artsonia collect verifiable parental consent directly from the parent, or b) having the teacher certify that he/she has collected the appropriate <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">School Consent</a> prior to allowing the students access to the Classroom Mode feature. Additionally, no child uploaded artwork (and associated title and statement) is shown publicly unless the child's parent or legal guardian has given <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a>, regardless of whether or not School Consent was utilized as the method of consent.</p>
			<p><b>We Never Sell Personal Information:</b> We will never sell or rent your <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> or non-personal information. We will only share personal information with a limited set of <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">third-party service providers</a> necessary to provide or develop our services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are. We will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy and ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols. See <a href="#InfoShared">here</a> for more details.</p>
			<p><b>You own your data:</b> We don't own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (students, parents and/or schools) will own your content and information.</p>
			<p><b>Security and Privacy by Design and Default:</b> We use security industry best practices to protect personal information, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect personal information. We design products with security and privacy in mind from day one. See <a href="#DataSecurity">here</a> for more information.</p>
			<p><b>Transparency and Choice:</b> We will be transparent about our practices, so that you can make meaningful choices about how your <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> is used. If we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us). See <a href="#Transparency">here</a> for more information.</p>
			<p><b>Right to Access and Correction of Data:</b> We support access to and correction of student <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents when the information is collected directly from a student and Artsonia obtains the parental consent (not the school). Teachers, parents and other users can contact us as described in the <a href="#Contact"><i>Contacting Artsonia</i></a> section below, or <a href="/contact.asp">here</a> to access, correct or update their personal information, or they can use the features in their account settings to do so. See here for more information, including about your additional rights of data portability and right to object or withdrawal consent.</p>

				Artsonia LLC ("Artsonia," "we," "us," and "our") is an online student art museum with Artworks published from thousands of schools worldwide. Thousands of teachers, parents and students use Artsonia every day. Teachers use it to manage school art galleries in a safe and educational manner, providing a positive and safe educational environment for students to showcase their creative works, developing students' pride and self-esteem and involving parents and relatives in student arts education. As a parent, if you create an account on Artsonia, teachers might send you newsletters about school art projects, or you might receive notifications from Artsonia of new Artwork your child has created. Additionally, you will be able to do certain other tasks, such as: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>View <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424534">feedback</a> from the art teacher</li>
				<li>Approve <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000420993">comments</a> left on your child's Artwork</li>
				<li>Add and edit <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423673">"fan club" members</a> for your child</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Parents can only access the above features and create an account linked to their child's school after receiving either 1) an email invite directly from their child's teacher and using the link provided in that email (which embeds a unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408154">parent code</a>); or 2) through providing a unique parent code during registration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By using the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature, students can upload their artwork, photography, voice or videos (collectively referred to as "Artwork"), art titles and statements, view stats about their portfolio, and leave comments for other students. If the student is under 13, they will not be able to utilize Classroom Mode unless either a) Artsonia first obtained <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> directly from the parent, or b) the teacher has enabled the Classroom Mode feature and certified that he/she has collected the appropriate <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> (or acted as the agent of the parent and consent on their behalf) prior to allowing the students access to the Classroom Mode feature. Additionally,  the first student in the class to use the Classroom Mode feature must enter or scan the unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423513">school access code</a> they receive from their teacher. In addition, prior to utilizing the Classroom Mode feature, the student's teacher must first create a child's <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screenname</a> by submitting a list of students for his/her classroom to Artsonia (the screenname is then generated by Artsonia). After the unique school access code has been entered, students then <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000813594">select their name</a> from a list of names shown to them once they begin typing in their name. This list of names shown is generated by Artsonia from the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405153">list of names provided by the student's teacher</a> to Artsonia and consists of their first name, last initial and assigned screenname. Additionally, at the teacher's option, they may enable a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423573">PIN feature</a> which means that the student must also enter the PIN as well as selecting their name from the list shown to them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				None of the Artwork of a student under 13, either submitted by students or teachers, will be shown publicly until Artsonia has also obtained <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a>.  In addition, all Artwork will be reviewed by the teacher to determine if there is any personal information on the Artwork, title or artist statement.  If the Artwork does contain personal information, the teacher will either remove or <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000813414">mask</a> any student personal information or will indicate that the Artwork submission contains personal information. If the teacher indicates the Artwork  contains personal information, then the Artwork will NOT be made public.

Artsonia may be acting as both a Controller and Processor as those terms are defined under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). For more information please see <a href="#Controller">below</a>. </p>
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you login to use Artsonia through https://www.artsonia.com (the "Artsonia Platform"), our mobile application (the "Artsonia App"), or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Service").  Additionally, this Privacy Policy applies if you browse the Artsonia informational website or buy <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421193">Custom Merchandise</a> located at <a href="/">https://www.artsonia.com</a> (the "Artsonia Website"). If you use the Artsonia App, Artsonia Website, or the Artsonia Platform with multiple devices – these will synch with each other. In addition, this Privacy Policy also covers Artsonia's treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other third parties might share with us, for example, the teacher's National Education Association ("NAEA") membership ID number passed to us from <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">NAEA</a>.

These other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information. </p>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles. We've tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you're not familiar with terms like personal information, cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000120913">key terms</a> first. For students, we have a <a href="https://artsoniablob.blob.core.windows.net/videos/Student-Privacy-20180821.mp4">short video</a> that highlights the most important details of our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We've also added a column on the right that provides short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with "Basically...") to help even more with understanding, but it isn't legally binding. </p>
			<p>Your privacy is important to Artsonia and a responsibility we take seriously, so we encourage you to review our Privacy Policy. If you have any questions, we're here to help.

		What Information Does Artsonia Collect from Children, and How Is It Used?
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="legal-section-content col-md-7">
			<p>The statements that we make regarding the information we collect from or about students and how we use this information applies equally to all students regardless of their age. Accordingly, where this Privacy Policy references students or any information collected from or about students, our privacy policy applies to students under 13 years of age as well as students 13 years of old and above. </p>
			<p>Artsonia collects the minimal amount of information from children necessary to use our Service. This information is necessary to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service and for security and safety purposes. Additionally, Artsonia follows the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) COPPA rules for parental consent.  Prior to a student accessing Artsonia, the teacher must have elected to obtain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> prior to the student submitting any data by either a) requiring Artsonia to collect verifiable parental consent, or b) certifying he/she has obtained appropriate parental consent or chosen to act as the agent of the parent and consented on the parent's behalf under what is commonly referred to under COPPA as <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">school consent</a> ("School Consent"). For more information on School Consent, please see the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools">FTC's COPPA FAQs</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Student Account Creation</b></p>
			<p>If the teacher activates the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature, the student's class is assigned a unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423513">school access code</a> provided by the student's teacher to connect with the class.  This unique school access code is usually entered or <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000426814">scanned</a> by the first student to use the Service in the classroom. Next, we ask students to choose their name from a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000813594">list shown to them</a> once they start typing their name in their class. The list of names shown to the student by Artsonia is generated by Artsonia from the list provided to Artsonia by the student's teacher and is usually their first name, last initial and assigned screenname. If the teacher has chosen to not obtain parental consent through the School Consent method, then prior to students submitting data and the student is under 13, the student will <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000810213">not be able to choose</a> their name, and will not be able to further continue uploading Artwork or using the Service, until Artsonia has received verifiable <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> (under COPPA) from the child's parent or legal guardian. Although not required under COPPA, we may also choose to impose parental consent requirements on students 13 and above at our discretion.  Currently, we <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405153">receive the parent or guardian email address of a child from the child's teacher</a> which we will then use, consistent with the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">requirements of COPPA</a>, to seek verifiable parental consent or provide  parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has separately created an account on our Service. </p>
			<p><b>Artwork</b></p>
			<p>Once we receive <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a>, or once the teacher has certified he/she has obtained appropriate <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">School Consent</a>, the child may then choose his or her name, and can continue to upload Artwork and any associated title and statement to that Artwork (which may contain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>) and is collected by Artsonia. The students are assigned a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">unique screenname</a> by Artsonia (which often but not necessarily consists of the students first name and a numerical suffix) based on this <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405153">list of names</a> provided by the child's teacher.  This unique screenname (and not the student's entire first and last name) is what is shown on the Artsonia Website next to any student uploaded Artwork (including any student entered title and statement associated with the Artwork).  Additionally, no Artwork uploaded by a child will be shown <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425054">publicly</a> until Artsonia has received <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> from that child's parent or legal guardian, regardless of whether or not School Consent was utilized as the method of consent. </p>
			<p><b>Viewing and Commenting on Artwork</b></p>
			<p>In addition to submitting Artwork and associated title and statement, while the student is accessing the Service through Classroom Mode, the student may enter in a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000420993">comment</a> (which also may contain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>) on another student's Artwork (in order to teach children about digital citizenship). Prior to being posted on the public Artsonia Website, these comments are then proofread by the student's teacher and the teacher will confirm that there is no personal information contained within the student's comment (or alternatively, they can edit and remove the personal information). For more information about comment approvals and how to edit comments <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423653">click here</a>.</p>
			<p>Beyond this, student access to our Service does not allow the child the ability to upload any other content to their account, or enter any other personal information. Children are also restricted from accessing certain features on our Service that would allow the child to post or disclose additional <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>. Currently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We DO NOT allow children under 13 to join a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000485913">Fan Club</a>.</li>
				<li>We DO NOT allow children under 13 to leave a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000420993">comment</a> on the Artsonia Website unless they are participating in Classroom Mode which is moderated by their teacher.</li>
				<li>We DO NOT allow children under 13 to leave a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421973">teacher compliment</a> on the Artsonia Website.</li>
				<li>We DO NOT allow children under 13 to submit a Contact Us inquiry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the <a href="#InfoAutoCollected"><i>Information Collected Automatically</i></a> section. </p>
			<p>We also receive from the child's teacher (and link to the student's account) whatever <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405153">name he or she has provided for the student</a>, the student's current grade, and the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424534">feedback</a> submitted by that teacher on the child's Artwork. Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name, only initials, or even just seat numbers). This <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006768294">chart</a> details the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.</p>
			<p>We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006764014">educational</a>, security and safety purposes, or as required by <a href="#California">law</a> or to enforce our <a href="/terms/">Terms</a>. We will not require children to provide more <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent's consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">service providers</a> necessary to provide the Service, as required by <a href="#InfoShared">law</a>, authorized school personnel as directed by the child's school, or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Information collected from students (including <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> and information collected automatically) is <b>never</b> used or disclosed for <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006763834">third-party advertising</a>. Additionally, personal information collected from students is never used for <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000488793">behaviorally-targeted advertising</a> to students (first or third party). Lastly, children's personal information is <b>never</b> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers. </p>

			<p>No child uploaded Artwork (and associated title and statement) is shown publicly unless the child's parent or legal guardian has given <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> to Artsonia (even if School Consent was utilized previously). Additionally, prior to the Artwork (and associated title and statement) being shown publicly, we first ask that the child's teacher review the Artwork uploaded by the child (and associated title and statement) to decide whether or not there is <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> of the child contained within the Artwork or the associated title and statement. If there is no personal information (or if the teacher removed or <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000813414">masked</a> all personal information), then we <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423613">require the teacher to represent</a> to us that they have reviewed and approved the child uploaded Artwork and associated title and statement to the Artsonia Website for public posting. We will then delete from our servers any original (unmodified) artwork and associated title and statement that may have contained personal information. If the teacher reviews the Artwork and associated title and statements and determines there is personal information and does not mask or remove it, then the Artwork and associated title and statement will NOT be available on the Artsonia Website for public posting, but will be available to be viewed privately by teachers and parents. Additionally, consistent with the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en/articles/115000856053">requirements of COPPA</a>, we ensure that any geolocation metadata that may be contained in the photos is removed prior to posting the files on the Artsonia Website.</p>
			<p>In addition, a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000420993">comment</a> (which also may contain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>) entered by a child while using the Service in Classroom Mode, on another child's Artwork (in order to teach children about digital citizenship) may be shown publicly. Prior to being posted publicly, these comments are proofread by the child's teacher, and we <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007743614">require the teacher to affirmatively represent</a> to us that they have reviewed and removed all personal information within the comment. Parents will also receive notification of the comments being posted to their child's Artwork. </p>
			<p>Any <a herf="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000420993">comments</a> left on a student's Artwork by non-students must first be <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423653">approved by the student's parent</a> before they are shown publicly on the Artsonia Website. Parents will receive notice when non-students leave comments about their child's Artwork and must approve the comment. </p>
			<p>It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the students showcasing their Artwork on Artsonia. Students' Artwork and comments will be identified by their unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screenname</a> (which often but not necessarily consists of the artist's first name and a numerical suffix). This unique screenname (and not the student's entire first and last name) is what is shown on the Artsonia Website next to any student uploaded Artwork (including any related title and statement associated with the Artwork) and comment. Artsonia does not knowingly post the full first name and last names of students on the Artsonia Website or Service next to student Artwork or comments. </p>
			<p>No student's <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424534">feedback</a> on their Artwork received from teachers is made available or visible to the public through Artsonia.

				We will not retain a child's <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> for any longer than is necessary for <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006764014">educational purposes</a> or legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child's personal information. Additionally, we only keep a child's personal information for as long as the account is <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000673693">active</a>, unless we are required by law or the child's school to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our <a href="/terms/">Terms</a>. Please note that deletion does not include Artwork, newsletters or teacher feedback as we may be required to retain these at the direction of the school (e.g. maintenance of "education records" under FERPA or student data under various state student privacy laws). Please see <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007908753">here</a> for how to request deletion of education records.

			<p>We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you may choose to voluntarily provide us while using the Services (described below under <a href="#InfoYouProvideToUs"><i>Information You Provide to Us</i></a> and (2) information collected automatically as a result of your use of the Services (described below under <a href="#InfoAutoCollected"><i>Information Collected Automatically</i></a>). We may also receive information about you from third-party sources (as described below under <a href="#InfoFromThirdParties"><i>Information Received from Third-Party Sources</i></a>). The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, parent, fan, customer (e.g. someone who purchases a custom keepsake), or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use Artsonia (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).

			<p>We ask for and collect the following <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> about you when you use the Service. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services. </p>
			<p>There are currently five categories of users on our Service: teachers, parents, fans, customers (who purchase various products), and students. Additionally, as a non-logged in general visitor to the Artsonia Website you may provide personal information to us. We describe the information collected from students, including students under 13, in the <a href="#ProtectChildrensPII"><i>How We Protect Children's Personal Information</i></a> section above; for other users, we collect and store the information provided from each type of user as described below. Our use of the information set forth below is described further in the <a href="#InfoUsed"><i>How We Use the Information We Collect</i></a> section. If you are using the Artsonia App, we may ask you for certain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424973">mobile app permissions</a>. We have also prepared <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006768294">this chart</a> of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored. </p>
			<p><b>Information Provided by Teachers</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><i><b>Account Sign-up and Profile Information:</b></i> Any teacher who wishes to display their students' Artwork, lesson plans or other educational materials on Artsonia is required to register as a member and will be asked to provide some basic information such as first and last name, email address, phone number, password and a profile photo. A teacher may also choose to provide an additional personal description or "bio." The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the teacher as well as to create a public school gallery on Artsonia, which will list the teacher's name, profile photos (if provided), bio (if provided) and the name of the school. The teacher's name will also be used in <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421573">automated emails from Artsonia</a>, sent on behalf of the teacher, such as teacher-requested <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000426574">newsletters</a> and <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000422113">student activity reports</a>. If an Artsonia Website visitor sends a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421973">compliment</a> to a teacher in the public gallery (the teacher's email is not shown publicly), Artsonia will deliver this compliment to the teacher's email address on file. Teacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers and by the general public on the Service. </li>
				<li><i><b>School Information:</b></i> As a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you will be asked to provide the name and address of the school that you are associated with (or to associate your account with an existing school already recognized on the Service). By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000810813">collaboration features</a> for teachers within the same school such as sharing roster students with other <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425514">verified teachers</a> in that school.</li>
				<li><i><b>Class Information:</b></i> To organize Artwork and to allow students to use the Service, teachers input first and (optionally) last names of students in a student roster. It is entirely the teacher's choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter John S or John Smith. The first and last names are entered into separate fields, and unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screennames</a> are then generated by Artsonia for each student, based on the entry in the first name field. Additionally, teachers will need to enter the student's grade (e.g. first grade), and optionally homeroom information as well as the student's parent email address. The parent email address given to Artsonia by the student's teacher will be used to obtain <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a> and will not be further by Artsonia unless the parent separately creates an account on Artsonia. Alternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the students first and last names, current grade and parent email address. Student last names are used to identify students in the school roster and are only visible to <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425514">verified teachers</a> at the same school.  Homeroom names are used to organize the roster for the teacher's benefit and are only viewable within that teacher's account. The student's first names are used in email correspondences to parents and Fan Club Members and is also the default caption (which can be edited) on all <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421193">custom merchandise</a> sold in the gift shop. </li>
				<li><i><b>Lesson Plans:</b></i> As a teacher, you may choose to submit information about your <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000486994">lesson plans</a> on Artsonia ("Lesson Plans"). Such information may include, the lesson title, grade level, content and achievement standards, objective of the lesson, how to assess the achievement of the objectives, the required materials, a description of the lesson procedure, resources, discussion questions, and links to sample artwork. Once you publish your Lesson Plans, they can be viewed by other teachers signed into the Artsonia Platform or Artsonia App, but they will not be viewable by the general public on the Artsonia Website. Additionally, you may choose to: 1) turn off the ability to allow other teachers to provide <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425954">feedback</a> on your Lesson Plans (the feedback will only be viewable by you unless you later elect to publish the feedback) and 2) opt-in to allow Artsonia to <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423233">share your Lesson Plans</a> with other <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000834473">artist and teacher organizations</a>. </li>
				<li><i><b>Artwork:</b></i> As a teacher you may elect to either turn on the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature to allow students to upload their own Artwork (and corresponding title and statements) or you may choose to upload the student's Artwork yourself (as well as optionally providing the corresponding title and statement). The Artwork that you upload on behalf of the students, as well as the Artwork you approve while using Classroom Mode, will not be shown publicly (along with the student's unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screenname</a>) until Artsonia receives <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a>.  Additionally, you may choose to upload your own Artwork, which will be immediately available to the public under a screenname you choose to represent you as the teacher, and will also be shown next to your teacher bio in the school gallery, which may display certain personal information entered with your bio, including your first and last name and photograph.</li>
				<li><i><b>Feedback:</b></i> As a teacher, you can provide <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424534">feedback</a> on your student's Artwork. This feedback cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student's feedback can only be viewed on Artsonia by that student (if the teacher utilizes the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423573">PIN feature</a> with the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature), the teacher who wrote the feedback, that student's parents, and other teachers the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to use the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> feature, other students in the school will not be able to see each other's feedback and will not see their own feedback (unless the teacher utilizes the <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423573">PIN feature</a>). </li>
				<li><i><b>Inviting Others:</b></i> As a teacher, you can invite your students' parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address. We will collect and store the email you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </li>
				<li><i><b>Messaging:</b></i> As a teacher, you can create an <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000426574">electronic newsletter</a> to communicate with parents as well as <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000422113">student activity reports</a>. We will store any content sent with the electronic newsletters (e.g., links text and images), to provide the Service, and to help teachers keep a log of their communications with parents. </li>
				<li><i><b>Testimonials:</b></i> You may provide personal information (such as your name, photo and/or a video) if you choose to give us a testimonial. We post testimonials on our Service or the Artsonia Website which may contain this personal information in the testimonial. We obtain the individual's consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us as described in the <a href="#Contact"><i>Contacting Artsonia</i></a> section below.</li>
				<li><i><b>Fundraising Information:</b></i> As a teacher, you may participate in <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423273">fundraising</a> on Artsonia if your school is located in the United States or Canada. If so, you may also provide a fundraising statement and photo which will be sent along with your full name in emails to parents and Fan Club Members, including to promote products (e.g. the custom keepsakes containing Artwork from the student's in the teacher's class). Additionally, once a teacher has received <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000426614">funds</a>, they may enter additional personal information to <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000426674">redeem funds</a>, including directly on third party sites (e.g. Amazon).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Teachers should be aware that, because personal information about themselves (i.e., their name, profile photo, bio and school) and any Artwork they submit (either their own Artwork or that of their students) is posted on the Artsonia Website and is publicly accessible to all users of the Artsonia Website, that information or content could be collected, used, and disclosed by others. Additionally, <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000486994">Lesson Plans</a> can be viewed by other teachers as well as feedback on your Lesson Plans (if you elect to publish the feedback). Also, if you chose to do so, your Lesson Plans may be <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423233">shared</a> with other <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000834473">organizations</a>. Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information or content by others you choose to share with, or those that view your information or content publicly. Artsonia does not publicly post teachers' email addresses on the Artsonia Website, and does not sell or share that list with third parties except where teachers have explicitly authorized Artsonia to do so, or to our <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">service providers</a> as necessary to provide the Service. </p>
			<p><b>Information Provided by Parents</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><i><b>Account Sign-up and Profile Information:</b></i> As a parent, you may wish to sign-up for an account on Artsonia and connect to your child at a participating school. You will need a unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408154">parent code</a> from that child's teacher, which will either be sent home to you directly with your child or be sent to you via an email link from the email address provided by your child's teacher to Artsonia. You will then be asked to provide some basic information such as first and last name, email address (if you were not sent the link via email), phone number (optional), password, and relationship to the child (e.g. mother). The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the parent as well as to create a public school art gallery on Artsonia, which will list the parent's first name as well as the relationship to the child in the child's art gallery as a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000485913">Fan Club Member</a>. Parent profiles are not viewable by the general public on the Service, but first name and relationship to the child will be in the Fan Club Member list linked to the artist gallery. You may also create an account on behalf of your child that is not connected to a school by providing the child's first and last name and your email address. Only the information provided by you in the "first name" box will be used to create a unique <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screenname</a> for your child and posted publicly.</p>
					<p>Please note that if you do not create an account on Artsonia, the email provided by your child's teacher will not be further used to send marketing communications to you. If you created an account on Artsonia, we will email you as further set forth under the section entitled <a href="#Communications"><i>Communications from Artsonia</i></a>. </p>
				</li>
				<li><i><b>Fan Club Information:</b></i> As a parent, you may <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423673">invite others to become fans</a> of your child's Artwork. To do so, you provide certain information to Artsonia, such as the individual's first name, last name, relationship to your child and their email address. The information you provide in the "first name" box and relationships that you provide to Artsonia will be shown publicly alongside your child's art gallery. Artsonia will use the emails that you provide to send notifications to these individuals, including when new Artwork is published, and may send additional marketing emails.  Fan Club Members always have the option to opt-out of any marketing communications using opt-out links at the bottom of emails received. See the section entitled <a href="#Communications"><i>Communications from Artsonia</i></a> for more details. </li>
				<li><i><b>Artwork:</b></i> As a parent (if you have a parent account on Artsonia) you may elect to upload your child's Artwork (and corresponding title and statements) yourself. The Artwork that you upload on behalf of your child will be shown publicly with the child's <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000405093">screenname</a>. </li>
				<li><i><b>Comments on Artwork:</b></i> As a parent, you will receive notice when anyone (student or non-student) leaves comments about your child's Artwork.  If a non-student leaves a comment about your child's Artwork you must <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423653">approve the comment</a> prior to the comment being posted publicly (student comments will be approved by your child's teacher before being publicly posted). Please click here for additional information on how to edit or delete the comment.</li>
				<li><i><b>Inviting Others:</b></i> As a parent you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the Artsonia App, for example by email or SMS. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you from having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly as described in the <a href="#Contact"><i>Contacting Artsonia</i></a> section below. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Parents should be aware that, because 1) the information the parent types in the first name field textbox when registering on Artsonia or when adding Fan Club Member, or 2) the content they upload when adding any Artwork of behalf of their child or 3) any comments on their child's Artwork they approve, are posted on the Artsonia Website and are publicly accessible to all users of the Artsonia Website, that information or content could be collected, used, and disclosed by others. Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information or content by others.</p>
			<p><b>Information Provided by Fans or Fan Club Members</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><i><b>Account Sign-up and Comments:</b></i> Any individual who wishes to sign-up as a <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000485913">fan</a> of an artist ("Fan" or "Fan Club Member") will be asked to provide some basic information such as first and last name, email address, relationship to the child (e.g. aunt), and date of birth. Artsonia asks for the date of birth as only users over thirteen (13) years of age are allowed to leave comments on the Service (unless they are leaving comments in a school setting using <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000408434">Classroom Mode</a> with their teacher approving the comments). The information provided during the signup process is used to communicate with the individual regarding the artist's activity and as set forth in the <a href="#Communications"><i>Communications from Artsonia</i></a> section and the information provided in the "first name" box will be shown publicly alongside any comments left by the fan next to the student's Artwork in the public art gallery on Artsonia. Individuals may also choose just to provide a comment and not join an artist's Fan Club, but will still be required to fill out the "first name" field. All comments submitted by non-students, including those that choose to become a Fan Club Member, are first sent to the artist's <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423653">parent for review</a> prior to being publicly posted. A Fan may also choose to leave a comment for an artist by <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425174">sending a postcard</a>, and if so, the individual will be providing additional information as set forth under the <a href="#InfoProvidedByCustomers"><i>Information Provided By Customers</i></a> section below. Fan Club Member profiles are not viewable by the general public on the Service, but the artist's parents are able to view and edit the first and last name, email address and relationship of the Fan Club Member and may also <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000423713">remove any Fan Club Member</a>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please note, that even if you did not join as a Fan Club Member yourself, you may have been added as a Fan Club Member by the child's parent (who also provided Artsonia your name, email address and relationship to the artist). The email provided either by you during a Fan Club Member signup or by the child's parent will be used to provide communications to you as set forth under the section entitled <a href="#Communications"><i>Communications from Artsonia</i></a>. Any email communication you receive will provide an opt-out link if you wish to be removed as a Fan Club Member from the artist.</p>
			<p id="InfoProvidedByCustomers"><b>Information Provided by Customers (purchasers of product)</b></p>
			<p>Online shoppers on the Artsonia Website must be over eighteen (18) years of age and must use a valid credit card or other valid payment method accepted by us to purchase products online.

Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth below: </p>
			<p><b>Other Users You Share and Communicate with on Artsonia:</b> If you are a teacher, parent or fan, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other Artsonia teachers, parents or Fan Club Members or to your children (if you are a parent). For example, things like your account or profile information and <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000486994">Lesson Plans</a> (if you are a teacher), <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424534">feedback</a> created for students you teach (if you are a teacher), Artwork (if you are a parent or teacher), or other information you share with teachers, parents or Fan Club Members. Additionally, Artwork (and associated title and statement) posted by students may be shared with others if publicly posted on the Artsonia Website (which is only after Artsonia receives <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000511854">parental consent</a>) and comments entered by students while in Classroom Mode and approved by their teacher, will also be publicly posted on the Artsonia Website. </p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that information (including <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> or children's personal information) or content (such as Artwork) that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other Artsonia users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information. </p>

For example, when you share or invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing from Artsonia (e.g. a student's Artwork). Please see <a href="#SocialMedia">here</a> for more information on Social Media features and <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">here</a> for more information on third-party services.

			<p><b>Service Providers:</b> We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service and Artsonia Website by performing tasks on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We may need to share or provide information (including <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, fulfilling product orders, providing customer support software, and security.  These <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">partners and service providers</a> have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on your behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>
			<p><b>Social Media Platforms:</b> Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise market and advertise our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students). These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest. These social media platforms with which we may share your personal information are not controlled or supervised by Artsonia. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such provider.</p>
			<p id="AggregatedInfo"><b>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:</b> We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006852593">de-identified</a>, or <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421293">non-personally identifiable information</a> (such as statistics about visitors, traffic patterns and electronic postcard usage) including with users, partners, sponsors, or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how Artsonia is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Artsonia. Any aggregated information and non-personally identifiable information shared this way will not contain any <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Analytics Services:</b> We use <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000424413">analytics services</a>, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service and Artsonia Website is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service and Artsonia Website, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.</p>
			<p><b>Legal Requirements:</b> We may use or disclose information, including <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Artsonia, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a> or other agreements. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests. Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Artsonia, or its users. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>
			<p><b>Sharing with Artsonia Companies:</b> Over time, Artsonia may grow and reorganize. We may share your information, including <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p><b>Change of Control:</b> The <a href="http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45">Student Privacy Pledge</a> requires us (and all pledgers) to commit to how we handle data in the event of a change to our organization such that all or a portion of Artsonia or our assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, or in any other situation where <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party. Consistent with the <a href="http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45">Student Privacy Pledge</a> and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, if any, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company. We may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (as their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion. </p>
			<p>In the unlikely event that Artsonia goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a>, and will not sell it to any third party. </p>
			<p><b>With your consent:</b> Other than the cases above, we won't disclose your <a href="https://help.artsonia.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000421393">personal information</a> for any purpose unless you consent to it.
