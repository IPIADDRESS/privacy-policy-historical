			<h4 class="textPageTitle">Privacy Policy</h4>
		
<p class="textnormal">At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting every User's
privacy. We use the information we collect to process orders and to provide a
more personalized service. Artsonia's privacy policy, described below, is
designed to use the information we collect about visitors with utmost care and
responsibility. </p>

<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana">

<hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" color="#cccccc" align="center">

</span></div>

<p class="textnormal"><b>1. Information Provided By All Users of the Website</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">The information Users provide to Artsonia through the
website is used to process orders, to provide enhanced and more personalized
service, and to properly index and display artwork. The data in Artsonia's
databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art
security procedures and software. </p>

<p class="textnormal">The information Users provide to Artsonia is for internal
business use only by Artsonia. We do not sell this information to anyone. </p>

<p class="textnormal">Personally identifying information that Users provide upon
registration as a member of an artist's fan club may be revealed to the
artist's parents but not to any other third parties. The first name (that is,
whatever name they put into the "first name" field in the fan club enrollment)
and relationship to the artist may be posted alongside the artwork to enable
artists and parents to see who all have joined the fan club and have seen the
artwork. </p>

<p class="textnormal">Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe,
in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law,
enforce or apply the terms of Artsonia's user agreements or to protect the
property, rights or safety of Artsonia, the users or others. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>2. Information Provided By Teachers</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Teachers who wish to display their students' artwork on
Artsonia are required to register as members. The information provided during
the registration process is used to communicate with the Teacher as well as to
create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will list the Teacher name and the
name of the school. Teachers should be aware that the personal information
about themselves - the name and school - is posted on the website and publicly
accessible to all users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by
others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure.
Artsonia does, however keep all Teachers emails completely private (emails are
never posted on the website) and does not sell this list to anyone. </p>

<p class="textnormal">Typically, teachers simply approve artwork (for posting in
the school gallery) that parents themselves have submitted to the website.
However, if a teacher chooses to upload class artwork oneself, the following
conditions also apply: </p>

<p class="textnormal">To organize artwork, teachers input first and last names of
students in a secured teacher roster. The first and last names are entered in
separate fields, and unique screennames are then generated for each student,
based on the entry in the first name field. It is the Teacher's responsibility
to ensure that only the first names are added in the first name field. Artsonia
cannot be held responsible for Teachers entering last names or any other
identifying information in the first name field. The information in the last
name field is never posted publicly on Artsonia, and both the first and last
names will never be divulged to any third party. Artsonia does not sell or
barter any identifying information about students to any third parties. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>3. Information Provided By Parents</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Parents who wish to display their child's artwork on
Artsonia are required to register as members. The information provided during
the registration process is used to communicate with the Parent as well as to
create an artist gallery on Artsonia. Parents should be aware that their
child's first name (that is, the information they provide in the first name
field textbox when registering) is posted on the website and publicly
accessible to all users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by
others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure.
Artsonia does, however keep all Parent emails completely private (emails are
never posted on the website) and does not sell this list to anyone. </p>

<p class="textnormal">To create an artist gallery, Parents input the first and
last name of their child. The first and last names are entered in separate
fields, and a unique screenname is then generated for the child artist, based
on the entry in the first name field. It is the Parent's responsibility to
ensure that only the first name is added in the first name field. Artsonia
cannot be held responsible for Parents entering last names or any other
identifying information in the first name field. The information in the last
name field is never posted publicly on Artsonia, and both the first and last
names will never be divulged to any third party. Artsonia does not sell or
barter any identifying information about children to any third parties.</p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>4. Information Provided by Kids (Children Under 18)</b></p>

<p class="textnormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial">Artsonia is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are
described below. Artsonia urges kids to check with their parents before
entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their
kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to
anyone they don't know.</span></p>

<p class="textnormal">Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information
from kids than is absolutely necessary.  Leaving a comment for an artist and joining
an artist's fan club are the only two activities that require Artsonia to collect
information from any kid under 18.</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;

     identifiable information collected from kids. <o:p></o:p></span></li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana">We DO NOT require a kid to provide Artsonia with more
     information than is reasonably necessary to participate as a condition of
     participation. <o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="textnormal"><b>Artwork Submission:</b> Kids under 18 may NOT submit
any artwork for publication.  Only parents and teachers are allowed to submit
a kid's artwork.</p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>Fan Club Membership:</b> Fan club members receive email alerts 
when the artist publishes new artwork or receives a comment, and the first name of the fan club member is 
publicly listed in the artist's gallery. Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to join another artist's fan club. 
When joining a fan club, Artsonia asks for the kid's first name, their relationship to the artist (i.e. friend, cousin, 
brother, sister), their email address and their parent's email address. Upon joining the fan club, the parent is 
sent an email announcing the kid's fan club membership and is given a simple opt-out unsubscribe option. 
If the parent unsubscribes, then the kid's fan club registration is deleted. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>Comments:</b> Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to leave a comment 
for another artist. However, if the person who submits a comment is under 13 years old, we require a parent's email address. 
Before posting the comment on the website, Artsonia sends an email alert to the parent's email address that includes the 
comment itself and directions to delete it. In addition, the comment is not posted until the parent of the artist 
(who is receiving the comment) officially approves it. Artsonia sends an email to the artist's parent alerting them of a 
new comment, and the comment is not posted publicly until that parent views and approves the comment for posting. 
In other words, when a kid under 13 leaves a comment, the parent of the commenter is alerted via email with an option to 
delete the comment, AND the parent of the artist that received the comment is alerted via email to approve and post the comment.
</p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>Gift Shop Purchases:</b> Kids under 18 are NOT allowed to purchase any products from Artsonia.</p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>5. Identifying Information About Artists</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the
artists showcasing their work on Artsonia. These artists will be identified
only by their screenname (which is often, but not necessarily, the artist's
first name and a numerical suffix). Artsonia does not post the full name,
mailing address or email address of artists on its website. There is no way for
the visitors of the website to directly and privately contact the artists based
on a screenname. </p>

<p class="textnormal">However, if the artist has signed his/her full name as part
of the artwork image, or if the submitter erroneously entered the last name of
the artist in the first name textbox field, Artsonia cannot take responsibility
for any damages incurred due to the negligence of the submitter of the artwork.
We require teachers and parents to submit artwork and/or digital images of
artwork where the artist's last name (if it exists in the artwork) has been
removed, erased or covered. We require teachers and parents to only type the
first name into the first name field when submitting artwork. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>6. Information Posted Publicly on Artsonia</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Users should be aware that any personal information - such
as name or school - that is posted on Artsonia is accessible to other users of
the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. (For example, if a
User leaves a comment for an artist). Artsonia cannot take responsibility for
such collection or disclosure. We strongly discourage users from using
personally identifying information in comments that they leave for artists.
Specifically we require the parents who approve the comments to erase all email
addresses and last names. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>7. eCards (Electronic Greeting Cards)</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">When a User sends an electronic greeting card through
Artsonia, an email is sent to the recipient on the User's behalf. Artsonia's
policy is to respect the privacy and confidentiality of the content of the
electronic greeting cards sent. Artsonia does not sell, barter or exchange
email addresses provided when sending an electronic greeting card. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>8. Cookies</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Cookies are small text files that Artsonia writes to a
User's computer to make it easier for the User navigate within the website.
Artsonia cookies do not contain any personally identifying information such as
passwords. Visitors to Artsonia have the option of disabling cookies via
browser preferences. However, if cookies are disabled, some features of
Artsonia may not function properly. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>9. Aggregate Statistics</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Artsonia may report aggregate statistics about visitors,
traffic patterns, electronic postcard usage and related site information to
partners, sponsors, advertisers, subsidiaries, affiliates and other reputed
third parties, but these statistics do not include any personally identifying
information. </p>

<p class="textnormal"><b>10. Choice / Opt-Out</b></p>

<p class="textnormal">Artsonia provides Users with the opportunity to opt-out of
receiving any future communications from Artsonia and its partners at any time.
