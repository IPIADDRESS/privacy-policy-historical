<p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. We will only contact you regarding projects you may be interested in; moreover, we do not sell or share your details with other parties who may send you unsolicited emails or letters/communications. Art Fund will use your contact details to send you communications from time to time about inspiration for your next art visit; National Art Pass members will also receive information on how to make the most of the National Art Pass. We also contact you in order to promote the exhibition programmes of the organisations we work with and how you can make a difference by helping us with major appeals to support museums and galleries across the UK. For example, we use the address provided by those who have a National Art Pass to send them copies of our magazine Art Quarterly, and we use the email address, with your consent, for our fortnightly e-newsletter 'Art in your inbox', which contains ideas for great days out, must-see exhibitions and the latest Art Fund news.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to receive certain types of letters or emails from us, we will respect your wishes.</p>

<p>We may, only on very specific occasions and always with your permission to do so, share your details with museums and galleries or relevant partners, for example if a person has donated towards a specific appeal to buy an important work of art for a museum, we will ask at the time of the donation if they will be happy for the museum to get in touch. We also work with a number of trusted suppliers to deliver our goods and services. Please see Section 7. Who we share your personal information with for more information.</p>

<p>This document details our approach to privacy and how we use and store the information you provide to us. Please read more to find out:</p>

<p>We use a number of trusted data processors in order to deliver our goods and services. This includes Supporter Services who can assist you with enquiries six days a week, and our mailing house who may, for example, send you your Art Quarterly magazine, and our professional advisers.</p>

<p>In some instances we will share your data with your consent, for example you may ask us to share your information with a museum whose Art Happens project you have supported. In other instances, such as when you have applied for funding, we may share your details with specialist advisors with whom we work to ensure that we spend our charitable resources responsibly.</p>

<p>All third parties we work with are very carefully selected and are bound by data-sharing agreements to ensure that they treat your data with the same care and respect as Art Fund.</p>    </div>        </div>
