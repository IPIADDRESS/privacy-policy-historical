<table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: 13px; text-align: Justify"><a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology
      and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use
      Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street
      address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We
      will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized
      third party. Period.
      <p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
      <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are
      visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
      services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
      when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
      certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may
      provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
      message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
      Like most Web sites, <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      also collects information
      automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
      transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
      Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
      hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store
      your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
      information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
      encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
      additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
      In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
      example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do
      you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked
      to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
      customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
      <p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
      <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit
      and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
      privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
      <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify
      you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
      about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other
      users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages
      are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated
      Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business
      partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally
      Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you
      individually.</p>
      <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      to communicate with you about your registration and customization
      preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
      products offered by <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> and other topics we think
      you might find of interest.</p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
      administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
      administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with
      you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation
      of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
      information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In
      addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may
      sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
      transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may
      also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other
      times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in
      connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law
      enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary.
      Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such
      cases.</p>
      <p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates
      to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
      parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
      providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
      collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our
      site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party.
      Also, through <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> you may be introduced to, or be able
      to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
      offered by other parties. <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      is not responsible for
      the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the
      applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
      information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
      <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
      parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of
      your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of
      our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
      enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
      advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer
      services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology
      to gather information. <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      does not control the use of
      this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not
      responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
      <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
      Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
      information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
      parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from
      other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control
      of <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> and this policy.
      </p><p><b>Children</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
      Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
      permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a
      child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that
      information immediately. If you believe <a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a>
      has any
      information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the
      address listed below.</p>
      <p><b>Contacting Us</b></p>
      <p>We can be reached by emailing us.</p>
      <p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
      <p><a href="http://ArticleWagon.com">ArticleWagon.com</a> reserves the right to change this policy at any
      time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use
      of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you
      accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change
      is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the
      time the information was collected.</p>
      <p><b>Governing law</b></p>
      <p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a
      dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with
      the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location:
      Austin. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the
      mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
      <p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution
      through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration
      at the following location: Austin, under the rules of the American
      Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the
      arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
      <p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and
      do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
      party.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
