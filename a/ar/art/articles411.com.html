Privacy Policy </font></span></p>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> strives to offer its
visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable
Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number)
subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent
your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the
activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, <span style="font-weight: 400">
Articles411.com</span>also collects information automatically and through the
use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we
may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to
recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to
re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of
times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we
adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example
by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be
unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your
user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features
according to your preferences. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and
<b>we do not share your information with anyone</b>.<br>
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may
be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage
patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our
site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features
are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you
individually.<br>
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> to communicate with you
about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
privacy policy; services and products offered by <span style="font-weight: 400">
Articles411.com</span> and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
Personally Identifiable Information collected by <span style="font-weight: 400">
Articles411.com</span> may also be used for other purposes, including but not
limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice
prior to disclosure in such cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> expects its partners,
advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and
other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy
and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to
our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> page, certain content that
is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> you may be introduced to,
or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. <span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span>
is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should
check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
information on a feature or page operated by a third party.<br>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties
may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third
parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> does not control the use
of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not
responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br>
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information
can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> and this policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Children</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span> does not knowingly collect
or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13
except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from
a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe <span style="font-weight: 400">Articles411.com</span>
has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the
address listed below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Contacting Us</b><br>
We can be reached by emailing us via the Contact Us Link. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>
Articles411.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please
check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those
changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be
used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Governing law</b><br>
This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Washington law. If a
dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the
help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Ada. Any
costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be
shared equally by each of us.<br>
If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through
mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the
following location: Ada, under the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered
in any court with jurisdiction to do so.<br>
This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not
create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
