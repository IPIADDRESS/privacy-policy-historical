</p><h2>The Article Distribution Center Privacy Policy</h2>
<p></p>
<p align="justify">In general, articlesender.com does not collect, store, use or disclose personally 
  identifying information except in very specific instances, such as, for example, 
  when you enroll as an advertiser in the Services, as defined below. Whenever 
  we collect such information, you will have a choice regarding whether to provide 
  it, how it will be used, and to whom it will be disclosed. The instances in 
  which articlesender.com does collect and use information are specifically described 
  in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p align="justify">articlesender.com provides easy to use services, including The Article Distribution Center Search 
  (located at www.articlesender.com)(the "Services"). The Services are 
  made available by articlesender.com and, its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively 
  "articlesender.com"). articlesender.com values its users and their concerns 
  about privacy. To this end, articlesender.com engages in consistent information 
  practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding those 
  practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that effort.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</b></p>
<p align="justify">This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information 
  by articlesender.com. If there are any exceptions, we will clearly disclose them 
  prior to collecting any information, and will give you an opportunity to choose 
  not to participate or provide the information.</p>
<p align="justify">Please be aware that, as part of the Services, articlesender.com provides links 
  to Web sites operated by third parties, and also provides search results and 
  similar services to third parties for display on their own Web sites or applications. 
  articlesender.com is not responsible for the information collection or privacy 
  practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. Also, 
  please be aware that banner ads on articlesender.com are provided by a third party, 
  which may collect cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These 
  cookies are typically used for the purpose of tracking performance of the banner 
  ads. articlesender.com does not determine which information will be collected by 
  that third party. Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Banner 
  Ads.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>What information does articlesender.com collect and how is it used? Does articlesender.com 
  disclose information to third parties?</b><br>
  articlesender.com may collect any or all of the following three types of information: 
  (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, or (c) contact information and 
  other personally identifying information. articlesender.com's collection and use 
  of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which 
  the data may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p align="justify">(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data. Data about traffic and usage is not personally 
  identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally 
  identifying or identifiable information. articlesender.com may share information 
  it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous 
  form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people 
  visited a certain area on our Web site, or searched Web sites for the term "fly 
  fishing." articlesender.com collects some information regarding use of the 
  Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. 
  For example, articlesender.com's servers collect information about the site from 
  which you entered to enable articlesender.com to calculate and pay its affiliates, 
  information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers 
  provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for 
  fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are 
  technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, articlesender.com 
  uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Cookies. Like many sites, articlesender.com collects information about online 
  behavior using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that 
  enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently 
  they are returning, as well as to streamline their experiences using the Services. 
  Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies 
  lets us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products 
  and services. articlesender.com may also use cookies to identify which sites our 
  repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising 
  on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business 
  partners. To articlesender.com, using information within cookies is an anonymous 
  way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. 
  You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able 
  to use all of the features of the Services. articlesender.com may share information 
  about usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous 
  form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party 
  advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information. articlesender.com 
  can obtain access to your name, e-mail address and other contact information 
  only (1) when you become an advertiser with articlesender.com, provide comments, 
  submit a problem, or request information from articlesender.com and provide your 
  name or return contact information, or (2) in connection with special offers 
  or contests.</p>
<p align="justify">Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests 
  is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information 
  is not stored or used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is 
  provided to a third party only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem 
  or request.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, you may choose to provide contact information, other personally identifying 
  information, and demographic information in order to participate in optional 
  surveys or contests, which are run for promotional purposes. articlesender.com 
  uses such information to send you information about its products and to notify 
  you if you win the contest. Finally, from time to time, but only with your permission, 
  articlesender.com may provide certain of its users' registration information to 
  selected third parties who wish to participate in special promotions offered 
  in conjunction with articlesender.com. Users may opt-out of receiving such communications 
  at any time by contacting articlesender.com.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Is data stored by articlesender.com secure?</b><br>
  To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate 
  use of information, articlesender.com has put in place physical, electronic, and 
  managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. 
  However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should 
  consider any communication that you transmit to articlesender.com (such as data, 
  questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree 
  that articlesender.com will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs 
  to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Does articlesender.com collect personally identifying information from or about 
  children?</b><br>
  articlesender.com uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually 
  identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are 
  not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of 
  the Services that require registration.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about 
  me?</b><br>

  articlesender.com, please send an e-mail containing your request to info@articlesender.com.

  specified in the e-mail.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>How do I find out more about articlesender.com's information practices?</b><br>
