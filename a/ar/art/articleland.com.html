PRIVACY POLICY</font></b></u></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Last Updated: July 8th, 2008</font></b></p>
<p align="justify">www.articleland.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy
policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any
unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
<p align="justify"><u><b><font size="4">How We Gather Information From Users</font></b></u></p>
<p align="justify">How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, www.articleland.com also
collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold
information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user
name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,
and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your
preferences.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u><font size="4">What We Do With The Information We
Collect?</font></u></b></p>
<p align="justify">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p align="justify">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most
or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow
anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p align="justify">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
www.articleland.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by www.articleland.com and other topics we think you might find of
interest. </p>
<p align="justify">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
www.articleland.com
may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in
such cases.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u><font size="4">Affiliated Sites, Linked Sites, Advertizers and Advertizements</font></u></b></p>
<p align="justify">www.articleland.com expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site
you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a www.articleland.com page, certain
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
www.articleland.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information,
Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.
www.articleland.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should
check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p align="justify">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable
the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
www.articleland.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or
the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of
such third parties.</p>
<p align="justify">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
www.articleland.com
and this policy.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u><font size="4">Children</font></u></b></p>
<p align="justify">www.articleland.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child
under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe www.articleland.com has any information from or about
anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p align="justify">www.articleland.com reserves the right to change this policy at
any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will
be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.</p>
<p align="justify"><b><u><font size="4">Governing Law</font></u></b></p>
<p align="justify">This policy and the use of this Site are governed by United
Kingdom law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to
resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following
location: </p>
<p align="justify">United Kingdom. </p>
<p align="justify">Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with
the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p align="justify">If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding
arbitration at the following location: </p>
<p align="justify">United Kingdom, under the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered
in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>

entirely within www.articleland.com. This statement and the policies outlined
herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal
rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
