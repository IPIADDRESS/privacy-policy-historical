<p class="articletitle">Article Adventure Privacy Policy</p>

<p>ArticleAdventure.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of
Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,
street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third
party. Period.</p>
<p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For
example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or
when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in
sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive
areas of our site. Like most Web sites, ArticleAdventure.com also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information
from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and
password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you
visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular
advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may
also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose
not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain
portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,
and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your
preferences.</p>
<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and
do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help
enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or
what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be
shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does
not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
www.ArticleAdventure.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by www.ArticleAdventure.com and other topics we think you might
find of interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticleAdventure.com may
also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site
administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in
such cases.</p>
<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
<p>ArticleAdventure.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to
respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,
including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection
policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link
to, or view as part of a frame on a www.ArticleAdventure.com page, certain
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through
ArticleAdventure.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. ArticleAdventure.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those
third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a
third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third
parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your
preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our
advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the
advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.
Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third
parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
ArticleAdventure.com does not control the use of this technology by third
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or
policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information
can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or
third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ArticleAdventure.com
and this policy.
</p><p><b>Children</b></p>
<p>ArticleAdventure.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by
law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in
violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you
believe ArticleAdventure.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,
please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
<p><b>Contacting Us</b></p>
<p>We can be reached by emailing us using the <a href="http://www.articleadventure.com/contacts.php">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p>ArticleAdventure.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time.
Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site
following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those
changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be
used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.</p>
<p><b>Governing law</b></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Texas law. If a dispute
arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a
mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Austin. Any costs and
fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared
equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through
mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the
following location: Austin, under the rules of the American Arbitration
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered
in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do
not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
party.</p>
