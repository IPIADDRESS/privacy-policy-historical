  Last updated: 1 March 2011.
</aside><p></p>

<p>The website <code>artfinder.com</code> and any related domains (the “Site”) is owned
and operated by Art Discovery Limited (“AF”, “we” or “us").</p>

<p>AF aims to respect and protect your privacy. This policy (“Privacy Policy”)

either sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or
that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please carefully read this
Privacy Policy in order to understand our views and practices regarding your
personal data and how we will treat your personal data.</p>

<ol>
<li><h2>1. Changes to the privacy policy</h2>

<ol>
<li><em>1.1</em> We may at our sole discretion, amend, modify or make changes to
this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do this we will post the
amendments, modifications and changes on this page. We may also, at our
sole discretion, send an email to registered users giving notification
of any changes. We recommend that you regularly check this page to take
notice of any changes. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction
with the <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><h2>2. Information collection</h2>

<p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>2.1</em> User Registration: Personal information that you provide when
registering as a user on the Site including but not limited to, for
example, your name, date of birth and email address.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.2</em> Usernames and/or Email Addresses: If we decide to offer users the
opportunity or ability to participate in online discussion forums then
you may be required to provide us with your username and/or email
address so we are able to respond to any queries you or other users may
have. AF recommends you take great care when choosing your username as
even if you do not provide any personal information to us, your username
may reveal personal information about yourself (e.g. age or name). This
information may be available to registered users, us, and the general
public.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.3</em> Site Visits: Details of any visits you make to the Site which may
include, but is not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs,
other communication data, and the resources that you access or use.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.4</em> IP Address and Browser Information: We may collect information
about your computer, laptop or mobile media device which may include,
but is not limited to, your IP address, operating system and browser
type, for system administration, to develop the Site and to report
aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about
our users' browsing actions and patterns, and no individual is
identified.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.5</em> Cookies: For the same reason, we may also obtain information about
your general internet usage and browsing habits. We may do this by using
a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Please
read Section 6 which provides more information on cookies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.6</em> Competitions: We may request additional information when you enter
a competition or promotion. The information we may request you to
provide may include, but shall not be limited to, you name, age, gender
and other demographic information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.7</em> Records: If you contact us to report any abuse or make a complaint
in accordance with our Terms of Use, report a problem with the Site or
for any other reason, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.8</em> Surveys: We may provide you with the opportunity to complete
surveys that we may use for research purposes. You may be offered some
form of incentive to complete the survey. These surveys are completely
optional and you may decide not to respond to them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2.9</em> Third Party Products and Services: We do not collect any personal
information (e.g. credit card numbers and addresses) related to any
transaction where you choose to purchase any products or services by
clicking on a third party link on the Site. However we may collect
information relating to the number of generic users who click on such
links, the number of purchases and/or the value of the purchases made by
these generic users.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><h2>3. Consent and storage</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><em>3.1</em> By providing any information to AF through the Site and by using
the Site as a registered user, you are consenting to the collection,
storage and use of your personal information by AF as set out in this
Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. You understand and grant consent to
the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information
outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If you do not consent to the
collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information to
other countries and territories outside the EEA, then you must not use
the Site as a registered user and you accept that many features may
therefore be unavailable to you.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3.2</em> When you provide AF with personally identifiable information
(information from which you can be identified), it may be used by AF and
its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries or parents for the
purposes of, for example, providing you with services and sending you
correspondence, and additionally may be transferred to entities other
than AF’s affiliates. These entities may be located in countries outside
the EEA. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that provide
different levels of protection for your personally identifiable
information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that
exist in the EEA. By registering with AF, you consent to AF and their
direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries’ or parents’ transmission
to, and processing of your information in any jurisdiction in accordance
with this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3.3</em> The data that we collect from you may be stored at a destination
outside the EEA. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be
engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By
submitting your personal data, you consent to the transfer, storing or
processing of such data outside the EEA. We will take all steps
reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3.4</em> All information you provide to us may be stored on our servers or
the servers of a third party in which case you consent to the transfer,
storing or processing of such data by third parties which may be
situated outside the EEA.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3.5</em> Where you have been required to choose a password which enables
you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping
this password secure and confidential at all time in accordance with the
Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p></li>
<li><p><em>3.6</em> The transmission of information via the internet is never
completely secure. Although AF will do our best to protect your personal
data and use industry standard procedures and security features to try
to prevent any unauthorised access by a third party, we cannot guarantee
the security of your data transmitted to our Site. You accept that
transmission of your personal data is done at your own risk.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><h2>4. Using information</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Non-personally identifiable information may be shared with third parties
to help us to introduce, develop and improve the Site, our service and
the user experience or for other purposes, such as providing more
relevant services and advertisements to users.</p></li>
<li><p>We may use your email address to contact you and send you notifications
or information related to the Site. We may also use you email address
for security reasons so that we can verify your identity.</p></li>
<li><p>You may be able to set preferences and control the elements of your
personal information which are shared with other users of the Site. If
you choose to display personal information such as comments, photos,
videos, or other information to other users of the Site, you accept that
you do so at your own risk. AF recommends that you do not share any
personal contact information. You can review and change your privacy
settings and personal profile, including who has access to your personal
profile, at any time.</p></li>
<li><p>AF may at our sole discretion and without prior notice disclose users’
personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are
compelled to do so by any law, regulation or other government authority,
in order to protect our rights and/or property or the rights and/or
property of the general public. We may also co-operate with law
enforcement agencies and where required, may disclose users’ personally
identifiable information.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2>5. Acquisitions and disposals</h2>

<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we acquire or
dispose of any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your
personal data to the prospective seller or purchaser of such business or
assets; or if our assets or a substantial part of our assets are acquired
by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our
customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p></li>
<li><h2>6. Links</h2>

<p>The Site may contain links to and from third party websites or the websites
of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link
to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own
privacy policies. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for such
policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data
to these websites.</p></li>
<li><h2>7. Children</h2>

<p>You must be 13 (thirteen) or over to register for the Site or, if you are
under the age of 13, you must ask your parent or guardian to register on
your behalf especially as there may be content that is inappropriate for
children. We do not knowingly collect any person information from anyone
who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register as a user of the Site
without their parent or guardian’s express permission. If we become, or are
made aware that we have collected personal information from such a person
then we will we delete this information including their registered user
account. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred then please
contact us at <a href="mailto:issues@artfinder.com">issues@artfinder.com</a> and we will delete all
relevant personal information.</p></li>
<li><h2>8. Cookies</h2>

<p>Cookies are small files that contain information that is transferred to
your computer, laptop or mobile media device's hard drive. They are used by
many sites to provide features to their users. They help us to improve our
Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us
to log and quickly retrieve your login information and provide data to
enable us to develop and improve the Site. We do not link the information
we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information provided by
users. We also use persistent cookies which stay on your computer, laptop
or mobile media device after you have gone offline. Persistent cookies can
be found in your browser’s cookies folder and remain there after you have
gone offline.</p>

<p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the settings on your browser
which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. You can learn how to do
this by accessing the ‘Help’ function on your browser. However, if you
select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site
or discover that you have a reduced functionality whilst using the Site.
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse
cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site.</p>

<p>Please be aware that our advertisers may also use cookies. Advertisers’ use
of cookies is not under our control and is therefore not subject to this
Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><h2>9. Advertising</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><em>9.1</em> AF may use third-party advertising companies to target and display
advertisements when you visit the Site. AF and its advertisers may also
use third party advertising networks to help present and manage
advertisements. These advertising networks may use general demographic
information (although generally not including your name, address, email
address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site to provide
advertisements about product, goods and/or services that may be of
interest to you. They may also use cookies, web beacons (electronic
files that allow a website to count users who have visited that page or
to access certain cookies) or similar mobile technologies to help
present, target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements,
using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to
determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their
audience.</p></li>
<li><p><em>9.2</em> Certain third party individuals or organisations may be granted
access to your personal information (excluding your email address) as a
result of agreements between AF and its affiliates and/or advertising
partners. (However, if you provide your e-mail address and/or username
directly to any such third parties, they may use your information for
their own purposes.) Our partners may use such information for their own
purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and
which may also include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These
third parties may be based in the United Kingdom or abroad (including
outside of the EEA).</p></li>
<li><p><em>9.3</em> Certain third-party advertisements on the Site may provide you
with opportunity to submit your username and/or other personal
information within the advertisement in order to receive information or
services provided by third parties. Such advertisements are provided by
third parties and, the collection and use of the information submitted
via such third party advertisements is subject to their privacy policies
which may differ from our Privacy Policy. AF recommends you read the
advertisers privacy policy before providing them with any personal
information.</p></li>
<li><p><em>9.4</em> We may also transfer statistical or generic trend information
about use of the Site, such as information stored via cookies or
statistical information, to advertisers. This information will not
identify any individuals</p></li>
<li><p><em>9.5</em> Please visit the Internet Advertising Bureau’s consumer website
<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.co.uk/">Your Online Choices</a> which will provide you with information
about how you can opt out from any targeted advertising delivered by IAB
member advertising networks..</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><h2>10. Access to information</h2>

<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) gives you the right to access
information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in
accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10
to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold
about you.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the Act, the data controller is: Digital Compliance
Officer.</p>

<p>Our nominated representative for the purpose of the Act is: Digital
Compliance Officer.</p>
