<h3 class="border-bottom" style="color: black;">AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>SNAP Interactive, Inc. (“Snap”, “we” “us”) has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the Snap Interactive Sites found at www.snap-interactive.com (“Site”), www.areyouinterested.com and other AreYouInterested properties including, but not limited to, our Facebook application and our mobile application (The Site and other AreYouInterested properties are collectively referred to herein as “AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications”). Snap provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the services accessed through its AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications (“Services”). </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use found at http://snap-interactive.com/tos (“Terms”). Each time that you access or use AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing the Services available through the AreYouInterested Applications.</p>
<p>When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about Snap Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>
<p><strong>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br>
<strong>Information Provided by You and Imported from Facebook.</strong>We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for our Service, interact with AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications. By clicking allow on the Facebook permission authorization we will automatically import your Facebook user ID and first name into your Snap profile. Once in your Snap profile that information may be used across any AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications. When signing up for our Service we will also use the information regarding your date of birth provided to Facebook for eligibility purposes but do not display that information to other users. Other than your Facebook ID and name, we will only incorporate the information you request to be imported from your Facebook profile (collectively, “Permitted Facebook Profile Content”) into your Snap profile.  </p>
<p><strong>Geolocation.</strong>We maintain information you provide about your location in order to assist you in finding other users within your geographic location and will maintain information about your location to facilitate your search. In addition, when you have the geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings. Snap never shows the exact latitude &amp; longitude or exact location of our users on our Snap Applications but we do update and store your location each time you visit the Snap Applications, maintaining only the location of your last location in order to show more relevant search results on “Browse Screen” and “Online Now” chat room. Members can update the search filter distance from “Browse Filter” to expand their location for other viewers. On your Snap Profile approximate distance in miles are disclosed from where you log in based upon the geolocation from your mobile device. On our Site we show approximate location of our iphone “Online Now” users. </p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Through Technology.</strong><br>
<strong>Web Logs. </strong>Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications. We may track your movement within the AreYouInterested Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the internet address from which you linked to AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or number of your mobile device you used to access AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness of AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies. </strong>To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications use data “cookies.” We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use persistent cookies to differentiate visitors from registered users, to customize the content of certain sections of AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Cookies help us learn which areas of our Sites are useful and which areas need improvement. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications, but your ability may be limited, and you may not be able to use certain features.  </p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons. </strong>Our web pages contain “web beacons.” Web beacons allow us to count users that have visited a web page or opened an email that contains a web beacon and collect other types of aggregate information. Using this information, we are able to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications are used. This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our users, which parts of AreYouInterested Applications are the most interesting and what kind of offers our members like to see. Some of the web beacons that are in place are used only by us, and other web beacons are from our vendors and advertisers who use this data to assist us in analyzing how AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications are used.</p>
<p>We use third-party service providers, such as Flurry Analytics, to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, on third party websites and sometimes on Snap Applications. The collection and use of any information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. In addition, they may collect, or we may share, anonymous information about your visits to Snap Applications, and your interaction with our Services. They may also use information about your visits to Snap Applications and other websites to provide advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of pixel tags or cookies. Information shared by us does not include any personally identifying information about the user. However, they also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you from other sources to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

<strong>Connecting with the AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Facebook Application. </strong>By clicking “allow” on the Facebook permission authorization screen you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Facebook user ID, first name, your Permitted Facebook Profile Content, and any information you have independently provided to us during registration into your Snap Profile which will be shared with other users accessing AreYouInterested?<sup>®</sup> Applications.
