</b></h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Service found at <a title="Terms of Service" href="http://www.snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://snap-interactive.com/terms-of-service/</span></a> (“Terms”). Each time that you access or use AYI Applications, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms and the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing the Services available through the AYI Applications.</p>
<p><b>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p><b><i>Registration, Product and Account Information</i></b><b>. </b>You can browse AYI without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information (i.e., name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, credit card information or physical contact information) about yourself. If you create a profile or purchase any paid services you choose to give us your personal information and are not anonymous to us. When you create a profile and register an account, or use certain of our Services such as searching for members, participating in AYI Now!, or otherwise engage with AYI Applications, you may provide certain non-public information (e.g., username and e-mail address).&nbsp; You may also provide payment information (e.g., credit or debit card information, name and billing address) to purchase a premium membership. Personal information is only associated with your account/profile when you sign in as a registered user.</p>
<p><b><i>Information to respond to your requests.</i></b><b> </b>You may give us your personal information so we can send you communications you request. Details of how you can opt-out of receiving any promotional communications from us are detailed in the section headed Accessing Your Personal Information.</p>
<p><b><i>Information Provided by You and Imported from Facebook</i></b><b>. </b>We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for our Services, interact with AYI Applications, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our AYI Applications. By clicking allow on the Facebook permission authorization we will import your basic account information (name, email, gender, birthday, current city, and profile picture URL) into your AYI profile.&nbsp; We also will import your interests, friends list, three most recent profile pictures, and “about me”.&nbsp; We will display your first name, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate) and you can edit all of these fields except for age and gender by logging into your account and clicking “Edit Profile”. &nbsp;Once the information is in your AYI profile that information may be used across any AYI Applications. &nbsp;The information we have access to from Facebook is controlled by your privacy settings on Facebook and by your consent. We only incorporate the information you allow to be imported from your Facebook profile (“Permitted Facebook Profile Content”).&nbsp; By associating your Facebook account with your AYI account and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store information from Facebook in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><b><i>Surveys and Promotions</i></b>. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary. Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey.</p>
<p><b><i>Information You Post</i></b><b>. </b>AYI Applications are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with AYI Applications and social media sites, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by AYI<sup>&nbsp; </sup>and <a title="tracking" name="tracking"></a>other third parties. &nbsp;There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public.&nbsp; Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.</p>
<p><b><i>Mobile Information</i></b>. We may collect additional information from you if you access AYI Applications through a mobile device (e.g. your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, location or GPS/geo-location, and billing information which we may collect when you opt in for us to do so).</p>
<p><b><i>Information Collected Through Tracking Technologies</i></b><b>.</b> In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your computer, mobile, or other access device whenever you visit or interact with the AYI Applications (“Usage Information”).&nbsp; <a href="#glossary">We use tracking technologies (including cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browers/web logs</a>) to collect usage information. We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p>Operationally Necessary. We may use tracking technologies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of shopping cart functionality.</p>
<p>Performance-Related. We may use cookies or other tracking technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the Services.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that certain features of our Services are only available through the use of tracking technologies.&nbsp;In addition, our use of tracking technologies may be associated with personally identifiable information that is associated with your user account.</p>
<p>You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Sites that assist us with various aspects of our web site operations and services to provide us with information about your interests from your web viewing on other sites.

<p>You also may encounter tracking technologies from third parties on certain pages of our Sites that we do not control and have not authorized. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page).</p>
<p>We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and/or connection information. During some visits we may use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.</p>

<p><b><i>Information From Other Sources</i></b>. The information we collect may be combined with information from outside records (e.g., demographic information, navigation information, additional contact information) that we have acquired in accordance with the law.</p>
<p><b><i>Contacting Us</i></b><b>. </b>When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business <a title="retention" name="retention"></a>relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>

<p><b><i>Security</i></b><b>.</b> We implement security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.

<p><b>Cookies</b>. A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit the Sites.&nbsp; We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Sites.&nbsp; Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.&nbsp; We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”&nbsp; Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Sites and expire when the user closes his/her browser.&nbsp; Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Sites easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.&nbsp; Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.&nbsp; Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp; Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.&nbsp; However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.&nbsp; If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.</p>
<p><b>Web Beacons/GIFS</b>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.&nbsp; Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.&nbsp; Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><b>Embedded Scripts</b>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the AYI Applications, such as the links you click on.&nbsp; The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device used to access AYI Applications from our web server or a third party service<b> </b>provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.<br>
<a title="glossary" name="glossary"></a><br>
<b>HTML5</b>. We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iphone or ipad.&nbsp; HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.&nbsp; Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.&nbsp; To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
<p><b>e-tags/cache browers/web logs</b>. Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the AYI Applications.&nbsp; We may track your movement within the AYI Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. &nbsp;This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our AYI Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our AYI Applications and usage and browsing habits.&nbsp; We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our AYI Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.&nbsp; We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>
