<p><strong>Cookies:</strong><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. When you sign in to your account on our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.</p>
<p>You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click “Help” in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.</p>
<p>We may allow third-parties, including SNAP companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver, and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you. The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong><br>
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to<br>
cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional (or other) e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.</p>

<h3 class="main">WhoIsNear Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>WhoIsNear, a SNAP Interactive, Inc. property, (WhoIsNear.com, the WhoIsNear Facebook Application, the WhoIsNear iPhone Application, the WhoIsNear mobile application, and any other connected WhoIsNear products shall collectively be referred to as “WhoIsNear,” the “Service,” “We,” or “Us”), knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by WhoIsNear when you use the WhoIsNear Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Non-conflicting Terms of the SNAP Interactive General Privacy Policy (http://www.snap-interactive.com/privacy.htm) shall apply to users of the Service as well. We expect that users will use WhoIsNear for fun social purposes. Please note, though, that by its nature, your location information is subject to abuse, misuse, and over-monitoring by others including, perhaps, by your friends, family, or acquaintances. Please manage your own mobile and profile privacy preferences on the Service, on an ongoing basis, accordingly.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #3e4da0;">Using the WhoIsNear Service</span></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In order to use the features of the WhoIsNear Service, you must consent to: (a) the use of your phone’s location to provide WhoIsNear to you, including the display and disclosure of that location information to WhoIsNear users and within your geo-tagged messages and content; (b) receive text messages; and (c) pay carrier data, messaging, and other fees resulting from WhoIsNear usage. Data and messaging (including SMS text messages) plans may be required to use the mobile features of the WhoIsNear Service. Standard data and messaging charges, fees, and taxes from your carrier apply.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e4da0;"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>1. User-Provided Information: You provide us with information about yourself, which may include your name, gender, sexuality, birthday, e-mail address, mobile phone number and carrier, etc., if you register for a Member account with the Service. You also give us permission to store and display this information and other similar personal information that is available to obtain from your Facebook profile. When using the Service, you may also provide certain other personal information and content, such as locations and activities, which will be publicly displayed to other users and on third-party sites and services in accordance with your privacy and opt-in settings. To provide the mobile features of the Service, we derive location information from your wireless carrier, certain third-party service providers, or directly from the mobile device or other device that you used to access the Service.</p>
<p>2. Location Information: To provide the Service, we collect, store, maintain, use, and display your personal data and the geographic location of your device used to access the Service. In certain cases, when you share your location at a non-public place such as your home or office, we may approximate your location in order to protect your privacy. While the Service does allow you to note your location at restaurants, bars, and other public places throughout your community, at no time does WhoIsNear ask you to provide your home address for use as a venue in the Service database. You should be aware that if you or your friends add your home as a new venue in the Service database and that information is published on the Service (for example, via a user checking in to that home venue), that information may be published by third parties without our control. To request removal of a venue from the WhoIsNear database, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@snap-interactive.com">contact [at] snap-interactive.com.</a></p>

<p><a href="mailto:contact@snap-interactive.com"></a>3. Cookies Information: When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets WhoIsNear help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. WhoIsNear uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p>4. Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p>5. Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your WhoIsNear account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make WhoIsNear better for our users.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #3e4da0;">How We Use Your Information</span></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service (including your location information and User Content) becomes available to the public. WhoIsNear is not responsible for the personally identifiable, profile, or location information that you choose to disclose publicly on the Service. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or related 3rd party services that displayed/aggregated your content, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p>When you have the WhoIsNear Software running on your mobile phone or other device, WhoIsNear may show your current geo-location to our Users, as controlled by your privacy settings.</p>
<p>By providing WhoIsNear your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address or mobile phone number to send you other messages, such as newsletters, text messages, when users check-in, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your settings page (click Settings). Opting out may prevent you from receiving messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages and our responses.</p>
<p>If you choose to invite friends to the Service, we may ask you for that person’s email address and automatically send an email invitation. WhoIsNear stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.</p>
<p>Your friends on the Service may be able to view all information you share with us including your location information. Furthermore, we may automatically establish “friend” relationships and labels on the Service with users with whom you are already connected as “friends” on other third-party services that we connect with such as Facebook.</p>
<p>WhoIsNear may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p>
<p>WhoIsNear reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. WhoIsNear also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
<p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>
<p>We may incorporate your&nbsp;submitted information and display your photos across any SNAP property including, but not limited to, any of our applications, our mobile applications, and any SNAP-owned websites. User authorizes SNAP to access, display to other users, and store their Facebook Profile information indefinitely on SNAP Sites &amp; properties.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3e4da0;"><strong>How We Share Your Information</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Personally Identifiable Information: WhoIsNear may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of WhoIsNear (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
<p>WhoIsNear does not share your personally identifiable information or personally-identifiable location information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your express consent or unless you have opted-in to be part of a specific program or feature. We cannot control third parties’ use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with such a third party, you can choose not to participate in such programs or features. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, WhoIsNear will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of WhoIsNear, our Users or others.</p>
<p>The Service allows you to connect with certain third party services such as Facebook and other similar services. When you broadcast information to such third party services, such information is no longer under the control of WhoIsNear and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain WhoIsNear services.</p>
<p>WhoIsNear may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the WhoIsNear site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on WhoIsNear. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. WhoIsNear does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks WhoIsNear to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The WhoIsNear Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #4646b8;">Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets</span>.</strong> In the event that we, or any of our businesses, are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, personally identifiable information of our visitors may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction. Information about our visitors may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support or funding. In such transactions, personal information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #3e4da0;">How We Protect Your Information</span></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>WhoIsNear uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to WhoIsNear and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, WhoIsNear makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from WhoIsNear, at all times.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #3e4da0;">Compromise of Personal Information</span></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, WhoIsNear will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
