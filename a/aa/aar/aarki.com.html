    <p>EFFECTIVE DATE: APRIL 1, 2011</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><p><u>PURPOSE OF POLICY</u>. 
                Aarki, Inc. (“Aarki”) is committed to respecting the privacy
                rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the website
                located at www.aarki.com (the “Site”) or of any software or
                services provided by Aarki (collectively, the “Service”). 
                Aarki created this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you
                confidence as you visit and use the Site and/or Services, to
                demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the
                protection of privacy and to inform you about our practices
                relating to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal
                Information (as defined below) that may be acquired or provided
                through your access to or use of the Site or Services.  This Policy
                is only applicable to the Site and Services, and not to any other
                third party websites or services that you may be able to access
                from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use
                practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy. 
                This Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a
                question about, or want to remove any Personal Information about
                you that Aarki may be holding.</p></li>
                <li><p><u>NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN</u>.
                 The Site is a “general audience website”, and Aarki does not
                knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons
                under 13 years of age and does not direct the Site, the Services or
                any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. 
                If you are under 13 years of age, then you may not use or access
                the Site or the Services at any time or in any manner.  We
                understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of
                children’s privacy online.  If we learn or have reason to suspect
                that a user of the Site or Services is under age 13 or if we learn
                or have reason to suspect that Personal Information of persons
                under age 13 has been collected on the Site or through the Services
                without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to promptly
                delete any such Personal Information.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</b></p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><p><u>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AARKI</u>.
                In operating the Site and providing the Services, Aarki
                may collect certain information, including without limitation the
                following:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li><p><u>PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>. 
                        When you sign up for an account at the Site or register for any
                        Services, Aarki may ask you for personally identifiable
                        information including but not limited to your name, mailing
                        address, phone number, e-mail address, contact preferences and
                        credit card or other billing information (“Personal
                        Information”).</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTEDINFORMATION</u>.
                        Our servers automatically recognize information
                        that your browser sends whenever you visit a website, which may
                        include information such as the domain names and Internet Protocol
                        (IP) addresses of visitors to the Site, as well as the browser
                        type and the date and time of the browser’s access to the Site. 
                        No Personal Information about you is revealed in this process and
                        we generally treat information collected by such process as
                        non-Personal Information.  However, to the extent that Internet
                        Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered
                        Personal Information by local law, we treat these identifiers as
                        Personal Information.  The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic
                        data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be
                        helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we
                        offer.</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>COOKIES</u>.  From time to
                        time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major
                        browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data
                        on your computer about your visit to the Site.  Cookies help us to
                        understand user behavior, and learn which areas of the Site are
                        useful and which areas need improvement.  We do not set any
                        Personal Information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture
                        mechanisms on the Site other than cookies.  We treat information
                        collected by cookies as non-Personal Information.  You can choose
                        whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your
                        browser.  However, if you choose to disable this function, your
                        experience at the Site may be diminished and some features may not
                        work as they were intended.</p></li>
                        <li><p><u>COMMUNICATIONS</u>.  When
                        you send email or other communications to Aarki, we may retain
                        those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond

                <li><p><u>PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>.  We
                will not sell, distribute or rent your Personal Information with

                we may (subject to “AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION” above)
                use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our
                servers, to administer our Site, or to display the content
                according to your preferences.  Traffic and transaction information
                may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an
                aggregate and anonymous basis.</p></li>
                <li><p><u>USE OF COOKIES</u>.  We may
                use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save
