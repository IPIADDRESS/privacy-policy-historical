<b>This policy describes the privacy rules that apply when you are visiting AARP Webplace. </b> We want to make sure that you understand the types of information that are collected at Webplace, the ways in which that information is used and protected, and the choices that you have about this collection and use.  Specifically, this privacy policy answers the following frequently asked questions:</font></p><font face="arial, helvetica, geneva, sans-serif">
<ol>
<li> <a href="#submit">Do I have to submit any personal information in order to use Webplace?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#cookies">Does Webplace collect non-personal information, using "cookies" or otherwise?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#control">How is this information used, and can I control its use?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#shared">Is any information shared with other companies or organizations?</a> <br>
</li><li> <a href="#rules">What privacy rules apply when I "click" over to other web sites?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#groups">Do privacy protections exist in discussion groups?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#security">How does Webplace protect security and confidentiality?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#change">Will this privacy policy ever change?</a><br>
</li><li> <a href="#contact">Who can I contact with questions or comments about privacy issues?</a></li></ol>

<p>When answering these questions, the terms "AARP," "we," "our," and "us" will be used to refer to AARP and its subsidiary, AARP Services, Inc.  The terms "you" and "your" will be used to refer to Webplace visitors like yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li>  <a name="submit"><b>Do I have to submit any personal information in order to use Webplace?</b></a>

	<p>You do not need to give us any information about yourself in order to access most of <a href="/">Webplace</a>.  You can visit our pages, read our publications, and learn about our member services on a completely anonymous basis.</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of some of the optional services available on Webplace, however, we will sometimes request information that allows us to identify you ("personal information").  If you use the online form to <a href="/join/">join AARP or renew your membership</a>, for example, we will ask for certain information to process your application (name, birthdate, phone number, mailing address, e-mail address, employment status, and credit card number).  If you register to receive e-mail newsletters, we will ask for your name, address, member number, and e-mail address so that we can send you the newsletters. We also collect personal information from you if you decide to set up a personalized "MyAARP" home page.  The MyAARP service allows you to create a customized home page that includes only the information that you want to see.  For example, your MyAARP page might include Webplace articles on health and fitness, local volunteer opportunities in your community, or articles from selected magazines or newspapers.  In order to provide you with this service, we will ask you for various types of registration information, such as your name, e-mail address, interests and hobbies, and the types of information that you would like to see on your customized page.  As explained below, we will also use "cookies" to recognize you, so you do not have to re-register each time you visit MyAARP.  Finally, we may ask for personal information when you participate in other activities or services on Webplace, such as surveys and discussion groups.
</p>
<p>We also have relationships with certain providers and vendors that we have selected and approved to offer services and benefits on linked sites.  On some of these sites, you may be asked to enter personal information in order to take advantage of their services or programs.  For example, if you decide to purchase counseling services on the <a href="memberguide/services/lifeanswers.html">AARP LifeAnswers</a> web site, the contracted member benefit provider offering the services will ask for your name, member number, address, and e-mail in order to contact you about the services.  Other examples of sites operated in conjunction with contracted member benefit providers include the <a href="memberguide/services/scudder.html">AARP Investment Program</a> from Scudder, <a href="memberguide/services/hco.html">AARP Health Care Options</a>, and the <a href="memberguide/services/rps.html">AARP Pharmacy Service</a>.  These sites may also have their own unique privacy policies that you should review. </p>

<p>Again, regardless of whether you are visiting Webplace or an affiliated site, you do not have to disclose any personal information if you do not want to.  You can always decide not to use the optional services that require the submission of such information.  The choice is yours.  We are only interested in offering you convenient online services that match your interests and needs.</p>
<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br><br>
</li><li>  <a name="cookies"><b>Does Webplace collect non-personal information, using "cookies" or otherwise?</b></a>

<p>We also collect other types of information that do not allow us to identify your name, e-mail address, or other personal characteristics.  This "non-personal information" includes the number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet ("IP address"), and the type of browser you use.  None of this non-personal information allows us to identify or contact you.  We use this information to help us evaluate how Webplace is being used.  By gathering this information, we can learn, among other things, how many people visit Webplace, which Webplace pages are the most and least popular, and which other web sites are the most frequent referral sources for Webplace.</p>

<p>We may also assign a "cookie" to your computer in some situations.  Like an IP address, a "cookie" is a kind of online identification tag that allows us to recognize your computer each time you visit Webplace.  Unless you have already provided us with personal information on Webplace, MyAARP, or an affiliated site, cookies do not allow us to identify you by name, e-mail address, or other personal characteristics.  We use cookies primarily to identify return visitors and make your Webplace experience more convenient. The <a href="/discussions/">Webplace discussion boards</a>, for example, place a cookie on your computer so that the next time you visit the discussion board, messages posted since your last visit will be highlighted.</p>

<p>If you sign up to create a customized "MyAARP" home page, we also use cookies so that we can recognize you when you revisit the sight.  This allows you to see your customized home page automatically, each time you visit, without having to reenter all of your registration information.  Again, the MyAARP service is optional.  You do not need to sign up for the service if you are uncomfortable with our collecting this information from you.</p>

<p>AARP has also contracted with a vendor to place AARP-approved banner advertisements on Webplace.  The cookies allow AARP to manage the delivery of these ads - for example, by counting the number of times a visitor has viewed different banners.  If a visitor has viewed the same banner a number of times, AARP can use the vendor's system to automatically display different banners in the next visit.  AARP has complete control over the banners that are placed on Webplace through the this system.  The vendor cannot collect any personal information from members on Webplace, and does not share the non-personal information collected on Webplace with anyone else.</p> 

<p>If you are uncomfortable allowing cookies to be place on your computer, a feature on Computer and Technology will teach <a href="/comptech/learning/howto/howto012.html">you how to set your browser so that it will not accept these cookies</a>, or so that it will notify you whenever a web site is trying to use cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use certain features of <a href="/">Webplace</a>, MyAARP or linked sites.  However, you will still be able to visit the general Webplace pages on an anonymous basis, just as you have in the past.</p>

<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br><br>
</li><li>  <a name="control"><b>How is this information used, and can I control the uses?</b></a>

<p>Our primary purpose in collecting this information is to provide you with the services you request, and to evaluate and improve other services that we offer.  As explained above, for example, we ask for information so that we can process your membership application, send you the e-mail newsletters to which you have subscribed, and provide you with discounted shopping opportunities.  We store your membership information in our computer files, and use this information to service your membership account, send you publications like <a href="/mmaturity/">Modern Maturity</a> and the <a href="/bulletin/">AARP Bulletin</a>, and answer any questions that you may have about membership. With MyAARP, we may use the information to customize your home page, so that it displays information, articles, and advertisements that match your interests. We may also use this information for other purposes.  For example, we may review demographic information, survey results, and statistical analyses of Webplace usage in order to help us evaluate, modify, and develop services that are likely to be of interest to our members.</p>

<p>On occasion, we will also use your membership information to send you notices in the mail about special member benefits, discounts, and offers.  If you do not want to receive these mailings, you can: (1) e-mail us at <a href="mailto:member@aarp.org">member@aarp.org</a>, (2) call us at 1-800-424-3410, or (3) write to us at AARP Member Services, 3200 E. Carson Street, Lakewood, CA 90712.  If you have subscribed to any of the <a href="/">Webplace</a> e-mail newsletters, and would like to stop receiving them, go to Webplace to unsubscribe.  Some affiliated sites may also send you promotional e-mails if you asked to receive them when you registered for their respective services.  In addition, each issue of these e-mail newsletters or notices will always include instructions for unsubscribing.  Again, these notices are designed to describe the benefits of AARP membership, but we do not want to send them to you if you are not interested in receiving them. </p>
<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br><br>
</li><li>  <a name="shared"><b>Is any information shared with other companies or organizations?</b></a>
<p>
AARP takes very seriously its responsibility to keep your personal information confidential and private.  Accordingly, we do not sell any of our members' personal information to outside companies, organizations, or individuals.  However, in order to inform you about official member benefits and services, we do share member information with the companies that AARP has selected to provide such benefits.  These "contracted member benefit providers" include the insurance companies offering plans through AARP Health Care Options, and the financial institutions offering products through AARP Credit Card Services and the AARP Investment Program.  For a list of the contracted member benefit providers, see the <a href="/memberguide/">membership handbook</a>, <a href="/mmaturity/">Modern Maturity</a>, or the <a href="/bulletin/">AARP Bulletin</a>.  We also hire companies to provide certain administrative services that require access to member information, such as processing address labels, managing databases, and sending mailings ("approved vendors").  </p>  

<p>We require all of these contracted member benefit providers and approved vendors to hold member information in strict confidence.  These providers and vendors are contractually required to maintain the security and confidentiality of all member information, and are prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than providing the services specified in their contracts with AARP.  We audit and monitor these companies to ensure that the member information is protected.</p>

<p>We may also disclose personal information when required to do so by law or when such action is necessary or appropriate to comply with legal process served on AARP, to protect and defend the rights or property of AARP, or to protect the personal safety of users of the AARP Webplace.  We reserve the right to contact the appropriate authorities in our discretion when visitors' activities appear to be illegal or inconsistent with our policies. </p>

<p>Finally, we may sometimes share aggregate statistics and non-personal information with the media, government agencies, advertisers, and other third-parties.  For example, we may publish statistics on the number of members in various states, or the number of visitors to Webplace.  These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify member names or other personal information.</p>
<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br><br>
</li><li>  <a name="rules"><b>What privacy rules apply when I "click" over to other web sites?</b></a>

	<p>Webplace includes links to other web sites, some of which are operated by contracted member benefit providers or approved vendors, and some of which are not.  Sites operated by contracted member benefit providers and approved vendors may also collect personal information, and may have their own privacy policies that differ from, and are not covered by, this privacy policy.  For example, the <a href="memberguide/services/scudder.html">AARP Investment Program site from Scudder</a> has its own unique information collection practices and privacy policy. It is important that you review any privacy policies on these sites carefully before you use any services or programs offered.</p>

	<p>When you click to unaffiliated third-party sites, AARP is not responsible for, and has no control over, the information collection or privacy practices of that site.  It is important that you review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before volunteering any of your personal information.  These sites may also collect cookies, or allow third-party advertisers on their sites to collect cookies.  You can often find information regarding a site and its privacy policy on the site's home page.  If you cannot find or do not like a site's privacy policy, you may prefer not to do business with, or offer information to, that site.</p>
<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br>
</li><li> <a name="groups"><b>Do privacy protections exist in discussion groups?</b></a>

	<p>It is important to understand that the information you submit in discussion groups, bulletin boards, and chat rooms is publicly displayed.  Your messages will be seen by people and organizations not related to AARP, and may be used by these third parties to contact you.  As a result, you should be very careful about the information that you include in these messages.  Because these unrelated parties will also see your "User Name" on any postings that you make in the discussion groups, you may not want to use your full name.  You can use your first name only, or use an assumed name, if you like.  The AARP Webplace Discussion site is offered in conjunction with an approved AARP vendor, and has its own terms and conditions of use.  To read these terms and learn more about using the <a href="/discussions/">AARP Discussion groups</a>.</p>

<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br>
</li><li> <a name="security"><b>How does Webplace protect security and confidentiality?</b></a>

	<p>In order to protect your personal information, we use technologies and processes such as encryption, access control procedures, network firewalls, physical security, and other measures.  These measures increase the security and privacy of information traveling to, from and within Webplace.  Only our authorized employees or agents carrying out permitted business functions are allowed to access personal information.  Employees who violate our privacy access policies may be subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate.</p>

<p>In order to receive some services, we may require you to use a password to protect your membership account from unauthorized access by others.  If you do allow others, including family or household members, to access the AARP Webplace through your membership account, please understand that you are responsible for the actions of those individuals.</p>
<!--TOP GRAPHIC-->
<a href="#top"><img src="/graphics/topofpage.jpg" width="80" height="20" border="0" alt="top of page"></a>
<br><br>
</li><li>  <a name="change"><b>Will this privacy policy ever change?</b></a>

<p>This privacy policy describes the types of information we currently collect, and the ways we use and protect that information.  If you are uncomfortable with our policies and practices, please do not provide any personal information to us through Webplace.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may collect different types of information and use that information in different ways - for example, when we add features or services to Webplace.  In these cases, we may edit this policy to explain the new practices.  Because protecting members privacy is very important to us, we do not expect major changes in policy.  However, if we do make significant changes in our practices, we will include announcements on the Webplace and MyAARP home pages, so that you will know to review the revised policy.
