		<p>We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website.

		<p>This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as "we" or "our" and "Company" refer to UnitedHealthcare and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.</p>

		<p><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong> <br>The Company uses various technologies, which may include "cookie" technology, to gather information from our website visitors such as pages visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on this website. "Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL. Cookies may include "single-session cookies" which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and "persistent" cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.</p>

If you are unavailable or unable to object, we will use our best judgment to decide if the disclosure is in your best interests. Special rules apply regarding when we may disclose health information to family members and others involved in a deceased individual's care.
