	  identifiable information that Grouplotto™ collects when you are on the Grouplotto™
	  Website and when you use GroupLotto's services. It is important that visitors
	  are fully informed about the use of their personal information. GroupLotto™
	  believes in 100% permission-based marketing. For each visitor to our Website,
	  our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but
	  not the e-mail address (unless requested and supplied by the consumer as a
	  registration field entry). <br>
	  <br>
	  Registration with Grouplotto™ is required to play the Grouplotto™ host of
	  promotional games. This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have
	  agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Grouplotto™ and GroupLotto's joint
	  marketing advertisers ("Advertisers") , whether at our Website, via
	  email, on third party websites, via co-registration or otherwise. GroupLotto™
	  collects information in certain portions of our Website, where guests provide
	  content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online
	  activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community
	  listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding, purchasing,
	  chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal profile information you
	  submit to Grouplotto™ and Advertisers remains your property, but by
	  submitting that information to Grouplotto™ you grant Grouplotto™ the right to
	  use that information for marketing purposes including, but not limited to,
	  sharing such information via co-registration with Advertisers. (i.e. by
	  clicking on any Advertiser's banner you agree to be co-registered at that
	  advertiser's website - at no cost to you). Grouplotto™ may also use such
	  information to deliver certain direct marketing offers to you via
	  telemarketing, e-mail marketing, direct mail, SMS messaging and other types
	  of direct marketing, fulfill prizes, track compliance with our Grouplotto™ Rules,
	  or for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal
	  information that you supply to us and we may join together with other
	  businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These
	  businesses may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct
	  marketing services to via telemarketing, e-mail marketing, direct mail, SMS
	  messaging and other types of direct marketing; and (b) providers of
	  applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression
	  and validation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a California state
	  resident you may opt-out from having your personal information transferred to
	  third parties for use is such third parties' direct marketing efforts by <a href="http://grouplotto.aavalue.com/GlobalOptOut.html">clicking here</a> and completing an opt-out request or by sending a
	  written e-mail request to <a href="mailto:CAoptout@traffixinc.com">CAoptout@traffixinc.com</a>.
	  However, where California residents opt-out from permitting their personal
	  information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers
	  directly from Grouplotto™, in accordance with the law. In addition, Grouplotto™
	  reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event
	  Grouplotto™ believes that the membership is being or has been used in
	  violation of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is
	  subpoenaed, if Grouplotto™ is sold or acquired, or when Grouplotto™ deems it
	  necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to
	  disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when Grouplotto™,
	  in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. To the
	  extent that customer credit card-specific information is collected by Grouplotto™
	  and any of its affiliates and/or subsidiaries, said information will be kept
	  in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than
	  consumer credit agencies) without the customer's prior informed consent.
	  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grouplotto™ and its affiliates and
	  subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that they
	  have credit card information on file for specific customers but they will not
	  share this credit card information with third parties without the customer's
	  prior informed consent. <br>
	  <br>
	  Grouplotto™ shares Website usage information about visitors to our Website,
	  who have received targeted promotional campaigns, with Advertisers for the
	  purpose of formatting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used
	  in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our Advertisers track some
	  of the pages that you visit on our Website through the use of pixel tags
	  (also called clear gifs). By registering with Grouplotto™, you agree to allow
	  Grouplotto™ to share such Website usage information with third parties. <br>
	  <br>
	  Grouplotto™ also reserves the right to provide aggregate or group data about Grouplotto™
	  users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or Group data is data that describes the
	  demographics, usage, or characteristics of Grouplotto™ participants as a
	  group. By opening a Grouplotto™ account, you agree to allow Grouplotto™ to
	  provide such aggregate data to third parties. <br>
	  <br>
	  Players under 18 years of age are not allowed to participate in sweepstakes
	  and games offered by Grouplotto™. No information should be submitted to, or
	  posted at, any Grouplotto™ Web sites by visitors under 18 years of age. We
	  encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and
	  to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children. <br>
	  <br>
	  Registrants may receive e-mail confirming their Registration with Grouplotto™,
	  co-registration with Advertisers and subsequent entries in Grouplotto
	  sweepstakes and games, as well as promotional marketing of commercial
	  products and services. Grouplotto™ reserves the right to collect and retain
	  data relating to email marketing sent to, and open by, individuals on our
	  marketing list(s). If you do not want to receive e-mail from Grouplotto™ in
	  the future, please let Grouplotto™ know by e-mailing us at the following
	  address: (<a href="mailto:Unsubscribe@Grouplotto.com">Unsubscribe@Grouplotto.com</a>).
	  To unsubscribe from any co-registration Advertiser's website, please visit
	  their website for complete details. <br>
	  <br>
	  Grouplotto™ does not endorse, nor is Grouplotto™ responsible for the accuracy
	  of, the Privacy Policies and/or Terms and Conditions of each of the
	  Advertisers on the Grouplotto™ Website. The entities which advertise and/or
	  place banner ads on the Grouplotto™ Website including, but not limited to,
	  co-registration Advertisers, are independent third parties and are not
	  affiliated with Grouplotto™. <br>
	  <br>
	  Grouplotto™ delivers to your web browser many of the advertisements you see
	  when you use the Website. However, Grouplotto™ also allows other companies,
	  called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within
	  and/or on the Website. Because your web browser must request these
	  advertising banners from the ad networks' servers, these companies can send
	  their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web
	  page from the Website. Please note that if an advertiser asks Grouplotto™ to
	  show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or
	  audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content)
	  and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you
	  fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. However, Grouplotto™
	  only authorizes our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad
	  delivery and anonymous targeting. To Grouplotto's knowledge, the third-party
	  ad servers do not collect, nor does Grouplotto™ give them access, to any
	  personally identifying information about you. In addition, Grouplotto™ uses
	  third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for
	  accounting and data integrity purposes.<br>
	  <br>
	  If you want to prevent a third-party ad server and/or third-party service
	  provider from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you
	  must visit each ad network's and service provider’s website individually and
	  opt out (if they offer this capability).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	  at some point engage other third-party ad servers and/or third-party service
