<a id="Access to personal information" name="Access to personal information"></a>Access to personal
information</h2>
<p>Generally, you have the right to see or obtain a copy of personal information about you that we
may hold.</p>
<p>AAPT will handle requests for access to personal information in accordance with the National
Privacy Principles.
<br>To request access to your personal information, please contact our Call Centre on 13 88
88.</p>
<p>As long as we can verify your identity, the person you speak to may be able to provide you with
the information you require over the telephone. If you wish to have a copy of any information, we
will ask that you put your request in writing and either post or fax that request to us. Again,
this is to ensure that we can verify your identity.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may need time to consider and respond to your request for access. If we need
time to consider your request, we will acknowledge your request within 14 days and respond within a
maximum of 30 days.</p>
<p>If for any reason we refuse to give you access to your information we will let you know why, in
writing.</p>
<p>The circumstances in which we may refuse to give you access to personal information we hold
about you include where giving you access:</p>
<ul>
<li>would have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy;
<br></li>
<li>would prejudice any negotiations we are having with you;
<br></li>
<li>would prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity;
<br></li>
<li>would prejudice activities carried out by, or for, a law enforcement body.
<br></li>
</ul>If you believe that we hold personal information about you that you consider to be inaccurate,
incomplete or out of date you should tell us by calling 13 88 88. In most cases, we will amend any
inaccurate, incomplete or out of date information. In some cases it is necessary for us to keep a
record of what we know or understand to be correct at a particular time. However, in those
circumstances, if you request, we will take reasonable steps to associate with the relevant record
of your personal information a statement to the effect that you claim the information is
inaccurate, incomplete or out of date. We would ask that you discuss your request with us by
calling 13 88 88.
