			  other organizations for commercial purposes. We do, however, reserve 
			  the right to use the information to selectively notify visitors 
			  about updates, products, services, activities, or upcoming events.

			  to help us learn more about site traffic patterns. You can set your 
			  browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the 
			  chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>
			<h3>Editorial and Publishing Direction</h3>

			  direct the creation and maintenance of content. </p>
			<h3>E-mail</h3>
			<p>Messages that you send to us by e-mail may not be secure. We recommend 
			  that you do not send any confidential information to us by E-mail. 
			  If you choose to send any confidential information to us via e-mail, 
			  you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information. 
			  We strive to respond to all e-mail requests in a timely manner. 
			</p>
			<h3>E-mail Alerts and Newsletters</h3>
			<p>This Web site offers e-mail alerts and newsletters to those viewers 
			  who have provided us with E-mail for notification of site events, 
			  special content and other opportunities specific to your areas of 
			  interest. All e-mail alerts and newsletters contain unsubscribe 
			  options so you may remove your name from these notices at any time. 
			</p>

			<p>The AAMC Web site contains links to other sites on the Internet. 
			  These links are provided for your convenience and do not constitute 
			  the AAMC's approval or endorsement of linked sites or their products 
			  or advertisements. </p>

			A cookie is a piece of text that a Web server can store on a user's 
			hard disk. 
			<p>Neither the AAMC nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliate entities, 
			  agents, employees, or subcontractors shall be liable for any direct, 
			  indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary 
			  damages, including lost profits (even if we are advised of the possibility) 
			  arising in any way from the information contained in this Web site
