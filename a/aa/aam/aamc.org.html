            <h3>Our Commitment  to Privacy<a name="privacy"></a></h3>
            <p>              The AAMC takes extensive measures to ensure the  safety and security of its Web site and information collected through the Web  site.&nbsp; We recognize that users of this  Web site, AAMC programs and services, and surveys may have questions about how  and why this information is collected. This privacy notice explains what kinds  of information we collect through our Web site, Web-based applications, and  other AAMC programs, and how we use this information.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The AAMC recognizes its responsibility to treat  with care the information it collects about individuals and institutions  involved in medical education and to respect their privacy relative to  sensitive data concerning them.&nbsp; To meet  this obligation, the AAMC has developed policies to prevent the exposure of  truly confidential personal data without the permission of the individual  involved, to limit the distribution of sensitive data to those situations that require  it, and to permit distribution of nonsensitive, directory information wherever  a useful purpose can be served. </p>
            <p>Your use of the AAMC Web site and participation in  AAMC applications and surveys signifies your understanding of the AAMC privacy notice  and consent to the collection and use of your information as designated below.&nbsp; </p>
            <h3>What  Information We Collect and How We Use It<a name="infocollect"></a></h3>
            <h4>Personal  Information</h4>
            <p>              As part of AAMC applications, programs, and  surveys, we collect certain personal information to provide you with the  services requested and to engage in research for specific, defined  purposes.&nbsp; Such personal information may  include names, identification numbers, contact information, academic records, institutional  affiliation, and other biographical information.&nbsp; These applications and programs include—but  are not limited to—AMCAS, Careers in Medicine, ERAS, FindAResident,  MedEdPORTAL, MCAT registration, and VSAS. These AAMC programs offer  password-protected sites for information collection.</p>
            <p>In addition to using it to provide a particular  program or service, information collected as part of the program applications also  may be used for educational research or verification purposes by the AAMC or  under restricted conditions by third parties as explained in <a href="#datasharing">Data Sharing with  Third Parties</a>. &nbsp;Personal identification  information collected also may be used to pre-populate application forms for  you when you apply or register for services or other programs to save you time  and effort.&nbsp; Access to pre-populated Web  applications is granted only after you log in correctly.&nbsp; In order to reduce redundancies and  facilitate the accuracy of data, the AAMC may pre-populate internal AAMC databases  across systems.</p>
            <p>AAMC surveys, such as FAMOUS, GME Track, the  Graduation Questionnaire (GQ), the Matriculating Student Questionnaire (MSQ), and  the Pre-MCAT Questionnaire (PMQ), collect data for educational and research  purposes, including reporting to AAMC constituents, providing summary information  to the U.S. Congress and other policymakers, and assisting members with  institutional management issues. From time to time, the AAMC may contact you to  participate in such a survey. Whenever the AAMC conducts research using  personally identifiable data (human subjects research), that research is  reviewed by an external (to the AAMC) institutional review board to ensure  protection of your interests.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The AAMC reserves the right to use personal  information in its databases to confirm identity of parties who may have made  unauthorized or inappropriate use of AAMC services or assets or who may be a  threat to public safety, including, but not limited to, denial of service  attacks, unauthorized use of AAMC services or networks, inappropriate e-mail  list activity, unauthorized use or distribution of AAMC intellectual property, or  threats to the safety or privacy of the public. &nbsp;Contact information will be used to provide  notice to the offending individuals and may be given to law enforcement if  warranted.</p>
            <h4>Credit  Card Information</h4>
            <p>              Once your credit card information, including the  CVV number, has been passed to the credit card processing company for  verification, only partial information is retained by AAMC for future  identification of the transaction.&nbsp; This  partial information includes several digits (but not all) of your credit card  number and your address when available.   We never retain the CVV number.&nbsp; Your  credit card information is kept within a secure database with limited access  and is neither shared with anyone internal or external to the AAMC nor integrated  with data from other AAMC databases.</p>
            <h4>Web  Site Usage Information</h4>
            <p>              E-mail addresses, aggregate information about which  pages visitors access, and information volunteered by site visitors—such as user  survey responses and site registrations—are used to improve the content of the  AAMC Web site.&nbsp; Some portions of our site  use cookies to improve your experience. &nbsp;For  example, cookies allow you to shop at the Publications site and browse to other  areas without losing the contents of your shopping cart.&nbsp; We also use cookies to help us learn more  about site traffic patterns. You can set your browser to notify you when you  receive a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept  it.&nbsp; AAMC editorial and publishing staff  also use Web site visitor data to help shape and direct the creation and  maintenance of content.</p>
            <h3>Data  Sharing with Third Parties<a name="datasharing"></a></h3>
            <p>              Any information published by the AAMC that is  related to medical school or residency applications, MCAT testing, career  choice, or similar surveyed topics is done so with aggregate statistics.&nbsp; The AAMC may also share personally  identifiable data with peer not-for-profit organizations, certifying boards,  licensing bodies, and other organizations involved in medical education for  research, eligibility determination, verification, and credentialing  purposes.&nbsp; Personally identifiable  information is also shared with medical education institutions upon direction  by you as part of the registration or application process or for scholarship  opportunities.&nbsp; The AAMC shares  de-identified or personally identifiable data with these parties only under  certain limited restrictions, including requirements to keep the data  confidential, destroy the data once it is no longer needed for the intended  purpose (except for applications to member institutions), and prevent  unauthorized release of the data.&nbsp; The AAMC  conducts such exchanges in a secure manner to protect against access by  unauthorized parties.</p>
            <p>If you attend an AAMC meeting, the AAMC may share only  your contact information with exhibitors.&nbsp;  Staff and faculty at AAMC-member institutions may also receive  publication offers from our publishing partner.</p>
            <h3>Security  of Collected Data<a name="security"></a></h3>
            <p>              To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data  accuracy, and ensure the correct use of collected information, we have put in  place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard  and secure the information we collect online.&nbsp;  Access to collected data is restricted to only those AAMC staff members  who require the access for specific purposes, such as providing services to you  or performing research. </p>
            <p>Messages that you send to us by e-mail may not be  secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential information to us by  e-mail.&nbsp; <strong>If you choose to send  confidential information to us via e-mail, you accept the risk that a third  party may intercept this information.</strong></p>
            <h3>How to  Access or Correct Your Information<a name="access"></a></h3>
            <p>              Access to your personally identifiable information  is available through your AAMC login (AAMC ID). &nbsp;Certain AAMC programs may have specific  processes for correcting or updating personally identifiable information. &nbsp;Please refer to the specific program Web site  to learn how to update or correct your personally identifiable  information.&nbsp; Otherwise, please contact the  AAMC directly at the addresses below to report such changes.</p>
            <p>To protect your privacy and security, we also will  take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making  corrections following such a request.</p>
            <h3>Protecting Your Personal Information Online<a name="protect"></a></h3>
            <p>The  AAMC and the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) take significant measures  to protect your data in their systems, but you must also be vigilant in  protecting access to your information online. </p>
            <p>Treat  your user names and passwords with care. Be careful not to share this  information or enter them into fraudulent sites. Be aware that legitimate  AAMC and NRMP sites include "aamc.org" and "nrmp.org," respectively. Do not conduct  AAMC or NRMP business with any sites that do not contain one of these  addresses.</p>
