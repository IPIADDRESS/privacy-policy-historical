                    <td><p>AAN Designers is committed to protecting your privacy, which is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe how your personal information is processed and used, and we will make every effort to ensure that our activities keep within the spirit of this Privacy Policy. You can tour through most of our site without giving us any information that personally identifies you, reveals personal information or allows us to contact you, but sometimes we do need information to respond to your requests. This privacy statement explains the data we collect from you and its use. Please read the complete privacy statement.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that by visiting and using <strong>www.aandesigners.com</strong>, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Information is AAN Designers gathering about its visitors and how is it being used?</strong> <br>
  Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. yahoo.com) and an IP Address (e.g. 156.162.13.113). When a visitor requests a page from within the <b>www.aandesigners.com</b> website, our Web Servers automatically identify and log the HTTP request that is made to our Web Server. This information reveals nothing personal about you. In fact, very little information is automatically gathered and logged. This information may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The IP address of the site that may have referred you to <b>www.aandesigners.com</b></li>
  <li> Your IP address</li>
  <li> Operating system that you may be using (e.g. Windows 98)</li>
  <li> Version and Make of Browser (e.g. Internet Explorer 5.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>  There is nothing special about the information described, and the practice of collecting this data has been generally standardized by virtually every Web Server on the Internet today.<br><br>
There are two major purposes for this information. <em>AAN Designers</em> has found it advantageous to observe visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for the various Browsers and Operating Systems that visit our site. Also,generating greater amounts of visitor traffic, as any business should attest, is very desirable. By analyzing visitation patterns, and referring URLs, we can strategically increase our exposure on the Internet.</p>
