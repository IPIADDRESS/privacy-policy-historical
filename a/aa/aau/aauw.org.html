What began in 1881 as a group of 17 like-minded women has grown into a powerful grassroots network with more than 170,000 members and supporters, 1,000 local branches, and more than 800 college and university partners across the United States.</p>

<p>As part of our promotional efforts for Work Smart Online, AAUW may share information collected from Work Smart Online registrants with select promotional partners including local AAUW Branches and outside organizations.

<p>You may disable browser cookies in your browser or set your browser to warn you when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp; You may lose some features or functionality when you disable cookies. Remember, also, that disabling cookies is browser specific. For example, if you use both Microsoft Edge and Chrome, you will need to disable cookies in each browser.\</p>
<h3>Pixel Tags</h3>
<p>AAUW also employs a software technology known as a pixel tag or Web beacon. A pixel tag is a line of code placed on AAUW’s websites or in emails which allows us to analyze advertising and the general usage patterns of visitors to our websites. Pixel tags help AAUW manage our website by informing us what content or promotions are effective. Unless you consent, we do not collect personally identifiable information from you using pixel tags. You may not disable pixel tags.</p>

<h2>For Members/Customers in the EU</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy includes information applicable to residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and users accessing the AAUW websites from within the EEA.

<h3>Transfer of Personal Data</h3>
<p>AAUW and our websites are based in the United States and, regardless of where you access these websites, the information collected as part of that use will be transferred to and maintained on systems located in the United States. Additionally, in limited circumstances, it may be necessary for AAUW to require the transfer of personal information from a third-party entity within the EEA to the United States for AAUW to provide requested services to a customer in the EEA. In any such circumstance, AAUW will ensure that the transfer of information is made in accordance with Article 49 of the GDPR in that it will be done only to perform a contract with you or to implement pre-contractual measures taken at your request. Should it otherwise be required for AAUW to receive personal data from another entity within the EEA, to ensure there is an adequate level of protection for the rights of a European person based on the United States’ data protection laws, AAUW will make use of either the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework or contractual data protection clauses and similar legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer, use, sharing and retention of personal data from the EEA in any such circumstance.</p>
<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<p>The GDPR provides you with certain privacy rights, including the right to access, correct or update your personal information. You may also request to have your information deleted, although we may retain information for backups, prevention of fraud and abuse, the satisfaction of legal obligations or other ongoing legitimate interests. You have the right to receive a copy of your information in a structured, machine-readable format. You may decline to share certain personal data, in which case we may not be able to provide you with some features and benefits. If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to object to our processing that is based on legitimate interests.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights granted to you by the GDPR, contact us via email at <a href="mailto:connect@aauw.org">connect@aauw.org</a> or via mail to the address set forth above, or you may submit the <a href="https://www.aauw.org/privacy-access-to-personal-information/">GDPR action form</a> available on AAUW’s websites.</p>
<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
<p>If you are an EEA resident and you believe that AAUW has infringed your rights under the GDPR, please contact us by sending an email to connect@aauw.org or calling 202.785.7700. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, including in your applicable Member State.</p>
<h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
<p>AAUW requests that persons to whom the GDPR applies do not volunteer any personal data considered sensitive by the GDPR, including racial or ethnic origin or sexual preference, even if a field exists for such information to be voluntarily provided. AAUW is required by certain governmental agencies in the United States to inquire about some sensitive information in relation to particular services it provides, but the disclosure of such information is always voluntary for the individual concerned.</p>
