			<p class="text_heading">Your right to privacy</p>
			<p>We understand the importance of protecting the right to privacy, particularly in 
			  relation to any personal details we may hold about members of the funds we administer.</p>
			<p>We have prepared this statement to explain how AAS aims to protect the privacy 
			  of each member's personal information.  The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) 
			  Act 2000 amended the Privacy Act with effect from 21 December 2001 to include laws that regulate 
			  the way private organisations, such as  AAS, handle personal information, including 	  sensitive information such as health details.</p>
			<p>The Act contains 10 National Privacy Principles that, among other things, regulate 
			  how organisations collect, store and protect the quality of personal information.  
			  It also regulates how these organisations should use and share personal information 
			  with other organisations. The principles form part of all our procedures and policies 
			  and the way we operate and administer our clients' funds.</p>
			<p>There is a summary of the principles at the end of this communication.  If a member 
			  chooses not to provide their personal information, it may mean that we will not be 
			  able to provide these services to the member, including some fund benefits and 
			  options.</p>
			<p>Other organisations connected to our administration services which may have access 
			  to personal information are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">mailing companies - contracted to do all mailing for AAS</li>
				<li class="bullet">archiving companies - contracted to ensure that all documents 
				  are stored in a secure environment</li>
				<li class="bullet">auditors and regulators - ensure AAS is complying with legislation 
				  and contractual obligations</li>
				<li class="bullet">insurance companies - provide insurance cover for members</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text_heading">Can members see their personal information at AAS?</p>
			<p>Under the national privacy principles, every member has a right to know what personal 
			  information AAS holds about them, and is entitled to see this information to ensure 
			  it is correct.</p>
			<p class="text_heading">What personal information does AAS keep?</p>
			<p>AAS collects personal information from fund members to administer their accounts in 
			  the funds to which they belong. We do so on behalf of our clients who are the trustees 
			  of these funds. The type of personal information we collect may include a member's name, 
			  address, date of birth, telephone number and tax file number.</p>
			<p>AAS collects personal information when members use their funds' websites to lodge 
			  their forms, such as membership application and change of personal detail forms, or 
			  if members send us fund documents containing personal information. There may also 
			  be circumstances when employers may send personal member details to AAS.</p>
			<p class="text_heading">Why does AAS need personal information?</p>
			<p>The personal information AAS collects, on behalf of the fund trustees, is used to 
			  establish a membership account, to process contributions to a member's account, to 
			  correspond with a member and to provide a member with benefits and options from 
			  their fund.  To obtain this information, members may contact us to ask for their 
			  personal details. The Privacy Act gives limited circumstances in which some or all 
			  access to this information may be denied. If this applies, we will explain this to 
			  members when they ask for their information.</p>
			<p class="text_heading">How to contact AAS</p>
			<p>If you would like further information on how AAS handles personal information, or 
			  if you would like to lodge a complaint about a possible breach of privacy, please 
			  contact AAS in one of the following ways: </p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet">Phone: (02) 8837 5007</li>
				<li class="bullet">Email: Compliance_AAS@aas.com.au</li>
				<li class="bullet">Fax: (02) 8837 5434</li>
				<li class="bullet">Write to The Compliance Manager, Australian Administration 
				  Services Pty Ltd, Locked Bag 4085, PARRAMATTA NSW 2124</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are dissatisfied with the resolution of any complaints, you can refer the 
			  matter to the Privacy Commissioner by calling 1300 363 992.</p>

						<p class="text_heading">Summary of the National Privacy Principles</p>
			            <p>AAS is bound by and will adhere to the National Privacy Principles at 
						all times.</p>
            			<p><i>Collecting information</i></p>
			            <p>We will collect personal information (where reasonable and practicable) 
						directly from the member.  We may at times collect personal information 
						directly from their employer.</p>
            			<p><i>Using and sharing information</i></p>
			            <p>AAS will use personal information to run a superannuation or redundancy 
						account for the member. This is known as a "primary purpose".  If fund 
						trustees need to use personal information for another reason, or secondary 
						purpose, like a marketing campaign, they will ask us to get members' permissions 
						to do so. If we are unable to get their permission before sending our 
						communication, we will give members the opportunity to opt out of any future 
						direct marketing campaigns at the time of mailing to them.</p>
            			<p><i>Keeping information accurate and up to date</i></p>
			            <p>We will take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect to administer a 
						membership account is accurate and complete.  We will do this by ensuring that
						members have the opportunity to advise changes in their personal details at 
						all times and particularly when they receive their annual fund membership 
						statement.</p>
            			<p><i>Keeping information secure</i></p>
			            <p>We will not misuse personal information or change it without a member's 
						knowledge. We will not share personal information with anyone who doesn't 
						have authority to see this information. To make sure of this, we will 
						regularly audit access to the systems that support each fund, and make 
						sure that other organisations we deal with for members' accounts (for 
						example insurance companies) have privacy policies adhering to the National
						Privacy Principles.</p>
            			<p><i>Sensitive information</i></p>
			            <p>Where we collect sensitive information such as health information, we will 
						only use it for maintaining a member's account in the fund to which they belong (including administration of insurance policies and information disclosure to the relevant insurer and fund trustee).  
						We won't use it for any other purpose or share it with anyone else without 
						a member's permission.</p>
