This  Privacy Statement takes into account changes made by the Privacy  Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 and was last updated  in March 2014.</p> <h2>Personal Information Handling Practices</h2> <p><strong>Pseudonymity and Anonymity</strong></p> <p>When contacting a company of the Link Group, you generally have the  right to remain anonymous (nameless) or to use a pseudonym (fictitious  name) to protect your identity. However, if you wish to make enquiries  about a specific account, we may need to identify you first, before we  can lawfully disclose personal information.</p> <p><strong>Collection of Information</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Link Group often acts as collection agent for our Clients, and we  only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for, or  directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities; or  because it is required under relevant law or regulation.</p> <p>We may sometimes collect sensitive information such as health and  medical information, but only when it is necessary to provide you with a  service or benefit.</p> <p>We normally collect personal information directly from the individual  or their authorised representative(s). Sometimes, we collect personal  information (including sensitive information) from a third party, a  publicly available source or by other lawful means, but only if:</p> <ul>     <li>We have consent from the individual, or the individual would reasonably expect us to collect their personal information; or</li>     <li>If it is necessary for a specific purpose such as executing a function or activity in connection with your account; or</li>     <li>Where we are permitted, or required to, by lawful authority.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Dealing with Unsolicited Information</strong></p> <p>The Link Group sometimes receives unsolicited information from  individuals or other sources. If we determine that we could not have  collected the information for one or more of our functions or  activities, we will take reasonably practicable steps to de-identify or  destroy the information. Alternatively, we will take reasonable steps to  protect the information from misuse or unauthorised disclosure.  Disclosure of unsolicited information we hold may be made where required  or permitted by law.</p> <p><strong>Notification of Collection</strong></p> <p>The Link Group often acts as collection agent for our Clients. All  reasonable and practicable steps are taken to notify you of certain  matters, or to ensure that you are aware of certain matters, at or  before the time of collection, or as soon as practicable afterwards.</p> <p>Where a form is used to collect personal information, it will  generally contain a collection notice (or reference to where a  collection notice can be obtained) and individuals may be asked to  confirm they have reviewed that notice. Similarly, if you contact a  company within the Link Group, individuals may hear a recorded privacy  script at the commencement of the call.</p> <p><strong>Use and Disclosure</strong></p> <p>We only use or disclose personal information where it is reasonably  necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or  activities; or because it is required under relevant law or regulation.</p> <p>We do not sell personal information, and we do not give personal information to other organisations unless one or more of the following situations applies:</p> <ul>     <li>We have consent from the individual;</li>     <li>The individual would reasonably expect, or has been advised that personal information may be used or disclosed;</li>     <li>If the use or disclosure is required by lawful authority; or</li>     <li>If the use or disclosure relates to one or more Permitted General  Situations under the Privacy Act 1988 including (but not limited to) a  serious and imminent threat to somebody’s life or health, or if it is  reasonably necessary for law enforcement.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Link Group takes reasonable steps to confirm that third parties with whom we deal, are also compliant with the Privacy Act.</p> <p>In executing services, activities and functions, where necessary,  personal information may be disclosed to third parties and/or related  bodies corporate currently located in Australia, India, New Zealand,  Papua New Guinea, South Africa, Canada, the United States, the United  Kingdom, France, China [Hong Kong] and Germany.</p> <p><strong>Direct Marketing</strong></p> <p>The Link Group may use the personal information we hold to provide  you with information about relevant products and services that may be of  interest or benefit to you. If you do not wish to receive marketing  material you can opt out at any time by contacting us or unsubscribing.</p> <p><strong>Data Quality and Security</strong></p> <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the  information we hold about you is relevant, accurate, up-to-date and  complete. Furthermore, we take all reasonable and practicable steps to  protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised  access, misuse, modification, disclosure or interference.</p> <p>When we no longer need the personal information  we hold about you, we will take all reasonable and practicable steps to  de-identify or destroy the information in a secure manner.  Alternatively, where that is not practicable, we will take reasonable  steps to protect information from misuse or unauthorised disclosure by  putting the information beyond reasonable use.</p> <h2>Your Rights - Access and Correction</h2> <p>You have the right to access the personal  information we hold about you. The Link Group encourages you to ask us  to correct any personal information we hold that is out-of-date,  incorrect, incomplete or misleading. To protect your privacy, we  strongly urge you not to provide any personal information that is not  required or that we do not ask for.</p> <p>If you have provided us with your email address  for communications, you can delete it at any time, but if you do so, we  may be unable to provide you with some services and benefits in  connection with your account.</p> <h2>Our Obligations and How to Contact Us</h2> <p>The Link Group is bound by the Australian Privacy  Principles [APPs] in the Privacy Act 1988. For more information refer  to our complete Privacy Policy. Alternatively, you may wish to refer to  the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) for  detailed information about the APPs.</p> <p>Link may make changes to the Privacy Statement from time to time, without notice to any person or third party.</p> <p>If you have any questions or if you would like to  give us feedback or make a complaint about how we handle your  information, contact us by phone on +61 1800 502 355 (free call within  Australia), 9am–5pm (Sydney time) Monday to Friday (excluding public  holidays); or by email to <a href="mailto:privacy.officer@linkmarketservices.com.au" title="privacy.officer@linkmarketservices.com.au">privacy.officer@linkmarketservices.com.au</a> or by mail to, the Privacy Officer, Link Group, Locked Bag A14, Sydney South NSW 1235.</p> <p>For a printable copy of this statement, please <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkmarketservices.com.au/corporate/downloads/LG_Privacy_Statement_B_v3.pdf">click here</a></p></div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="accessibility"><ul class="list"><li class="print"><a href="javascript:printpage()" title="Print this page">Print</a></li><li class="decrease"><a href="javascript:decreaseFontSize()">Decrease Font Size</a></li><li class="increase"><a href="javascript:increaseFontSize()">Increase Font Size</a></li></ul></div><div class="spotlight careers"><h3>AAS careers</h3><div id="spotlight"><a href="/public/Careers.html"><img alt="Looking for a super outcome in your career?" src="/public/Footer/Privacy-Policy/rightColumnParagraphs/0/image/spotlight_careers.jpg"></a></div><script type="text/javascript">
