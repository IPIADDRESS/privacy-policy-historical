			<li><strong>1.1</strong> AQA is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When you register with AQA for one of its services, including this Website, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, for example your name, address, or email address. AQA will store this data and hold it on computers or otherwise, and use it for the purposes outlined below.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>2. Use of personal information</strong>

					<li>financial administration</li>
					<li>notification of a phase of the examination cycle</li>
					<li>notification of new functionality released by AQA within an existing service</li>

			<li><strong>2.3</strong> If you do not inform AQA that you do not wish to receive marketing message from AQA then AQA may send you, from time to time, messages to keep you informed of other suitable products or services.  AQA will give you the opportunity of 'opting out' of receiving such communications both when you give AQA your information and with each marketing message AQA may send you.</li>

			<li><strong>2.4</strong> AQA will not pass on your details to any third party (save for as set out below) unless you give AQA permission to do so or AQA is required to do so by law.</li>

			<li><strong>2.5</strong> AQA may use one or more agencies to send you marketing messages or materials on behalf of AQA. This means that your data may be held temporarily by such agency but this will be under AQA's control and the data will not be used for any other purpose.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>3. Controlling access to personal information </strong>

			<ul>
				<li>employees working on AQA processes</li>

			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>4. Storing your personal information</strong>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>4.1.</strong> To protect your personal information, AQA has an independently certificated Information Security Management System that includes:

			<ul>
				<li>strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information you have given AQA, to prevent unauthorised access</li>
				<li>robust firewall technologies and logical network segmentation, allowing restricted access to stored profile information</li>
				<li>logical and physical security restrictions to our databases and systems.</li>
			</ul>

			</li><li><strong>4.2.</strong> Whilst AQA accepts its obligation to preserve the confidentiality of all personal data that you, as a data subject, have disclosed, it cannot fully guarantee the security of the conduit that has been used to transmit the data to AQA. Accordingly, you accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing on-line over the Internet and will not hold AQA responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to AQA's sole negligence or wilful default.</li>

			<li><strong>4.3.</strong> The AQA website, like most other websites, stores basic information about its visitors in log files. The information includes:

				<li>what kind of web browsers AQA's visitors use</li>

			<li><strong>4.4.</strong> AQA use this information to see which are the most popular parts of the AQA website and to help us improve the navigation and content on the site.</li>

			<li><strong>4.5.</strong> Log files do not contain any personal information and AQA do not use them to track the way in which individuals use the AQA website.</li>

			</li>
			<li><strong>5.2 </strong>If you have had any dealings with AQA (for example as a teacher, candidate, parent of a candidate, examiner, employee or as a supplier of goods and services) it is possible that AQA holds information about you as a 'data subject'.
			</li>
			<li><strong>5.3 </strong>You are entitled to ask AQA to disclose the information that it holds about you and, on payment of a standard fee of £10, AQA is obliged to obtain that information and share it with you within 40 days. AQA will formally accept a disclosure request upon receipt of (a) the formal request (b) the fee and (c) where the request is made on behalf of a data subject (for example a parent or guardian initiating a request on behalf of a child), confirmation from the data subject that the adult in question is acting on their behalf. If you submit your request by email to an existing contact you will still need to send the fee before the process can proceed.</li>
			<li><strong>5.4 </strong>You are entitled to ask AQA to correct any inaccuracies in any of the data it holds about you.
			</li>
			<li><strong>5.5 </strong>You would normally direct your request for such disclosure to the Department within AQA with whom you have had dealings. However, if you are uncertain about the identity of your contact or the relevant Department, please address your enquiry to AQA's Data Protection Compliance Officer Mr P G Dawson, Director of Information &amp; Communications Technology, AQA, Devas Street, Manchester, M15 6EX.
