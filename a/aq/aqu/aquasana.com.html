</p><span class="heading">What Other Information Do We Collect?</span><br>
We collect non-personally identifiable information, which does not personally identify you, in the following ways: <p>
</p><span class="heading">Aggregated Information</span><br>
Additionally, we may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code or follow a particular path through the Site. Such aggregate information is considered non-personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy. <p>
</p><span class="heading">"Clickstream" Data</span><br>
The Site automatically collects certain data concerning its interactions with visitors that facilitate Site operation, management and planning. Such data may include the IP address of your computer, the date and time of an online request, the type of browser and operating system used by your computer, the time required to download information you requested, and error codes generated while your browser is in contact with the Site. <p>
</p><span class="heading">Cookies and Other Technologies</span><br>
Cookies are small text files, placed on the hard drive of a visitor's computer, that facilitate the operation of the Site and visitors' use of the Site. As is standard practice on most corporate websites, the Site uses cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to help us understand which websites our visitors are coming from and what websites they go to when they leave our Site, which parts of the Site are the most popular, and how much time they spend on our Site. We also use cookies and other technologies to facilitate participation in our loyalty programs as well as to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. 
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so click the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use those enhanced services on the Site. <p>
</p>Some uses of cookies in connection with the Site may be under the control of third-party entities that Aquasana retains for the management of certain programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/consumer requests. Aquasana requests these entities to confine their use of cookies and similar technologies, but Aquasana cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies. <p>
</p><span class="heading">How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</span><br>
Personal information provided by consumers and visitors to our Site is used to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through the Site. For example, if you choose to purchase a product or service through the Site, we may use your personal information to process your transaction and fulfill your order. If you contact us through the Site, we will use your personal information to respond to your queries and requests. If you register a product through the Site, we will use your personal information to fulfill your registration, and if you sign up for the Water 4 Life® program, we will use your personal information to administer the program. <p>
</p>From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use your personal information to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, we recommend you not opt- out of receiving such communications, but you can opt-out at <a href="unsubscribe.php">www.aquasana.com/unsubscribe.php</a>.  <p>We may use your personal information to send you marketing-related e-mails from us, but we have never, and do not intend to ever, send you marketing messages from other companies. If you would prefer not to receive such marketing-related e-mails, please opt-out at <a href="unsubscribe.php">www.aquasana.com/unsubscribe.php</a>. 
</p><p>We may also use your personal information for our internal business purposes, such as for data analysis, for audits, to improve our website, to analyze usage patterns and to improve our services. </p>
<p>When Do We Disclose the Personal Information We Collect?<br>
We may provide your personal information to our third party service providers to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through the Site. For example, Aquasana may use third party service providers to conduct consumer surveys. Aquasana may also share certain information with third party organizations for the purpose of processing your credit card transactions. Aquasana seeks to restrict third parties' use of such data to the purposes for which it has been provided and to ensure the third parties do not disclose that information to unauthorized parties. </p>
<p>If you choose not to opt- out, Aquasana may from time to time send you marketing promotions with discount codes and/or a quarterly newsletter with information on upcoming sales, water quality, or news from the Water Filtration Industry, etc.</p>
<p>Aquasana will provide personal information to law enforcement authorities and other entities where Aquasana determines that such disclosure is required by subpoena, warrant, court order or other applicable law or process.

<p>Although Aquasana seeks to require companies with which it does business, and to which personal information is provided, to protect such personal information, Aquasana cannot be responsible for third parties' violations of this Policy or of any other rights of visitors or consumers that use this Site. </p>
<p>Aquasana may transfer personal information and other information, collected online from visitors and consumers, to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of Aquasana, a subsidiary or affiliate or line of business associated with Aquasana, or substantially all of the assets of Aquasana or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business. </p>
<p><span class="heading">How Do We Use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect?</span><br>
Because non-personally identifiable information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personally identifiable information, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. For example, we may share non-personally identifiable information collected in connection with consumer surveys and other activities, with consumer research and marketing firms or U.S. Census Surveys. </p>
<p>In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personal information. If we do combine any non-personally identifiable information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information hereunder as long as it is so combined. </p>

<p><span class="heading">Return Policy</span><br>
Sun Water Systems, Inc., the manufacturer of the Aquasana products, has chosen this factory direct method of marketing in order to offer the highest quality products to our valued customers at the most affordable prices possible.

You not only get the most effective home water enhancement products available anywhere, but you get them at a highly discounted price.  Any time within the 60 day trial period, (90 Days for The Rhino EQ-300) which begins when you receive your order, you may call or log on to request a return merchandise authorization number (RMA). This number entitles you to a full refund of the purchase price for the product(s) you ordered... no questions asked! All you have to do is write this code on the outside of the package and return it to us; we'll gladly refund the full purchase price of the returned product. The Customer is responsible for the return shipping costs for all returns except returns of the EQ-300. For EQ-300 returns, Aquasana will pay the return shipping cost.</p>
<p><span class="heading">Warranty Terms</span><br>
The Company warrants that all the Products shall be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one-hundred (100) days from the date of purchase by the customer (except that all versions of the EQ-300 Whole House Water Filtration System are warranted for a period of one (1) year). This warranty is limited to repair or replacement of defective Products upon return with proof of purchase date by the customer to Aquasana. Aquasana is not responsible for defects or damages due to improper use or installation. This warranty does not cover clogged or exhausted filter cartridges as the Company has no way to control or determine excessive sediment or contaminant levels in water supplies.</p>

THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL DEFECTS CAN BE CORRECTED.  TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT, UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.  THE COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY CONCERNING THE QUALITY, PERFORMANCE OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCTS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH ARE CONSISTENT IN ALL RESPECT WITH, AND DO NOT EXPAND THE SCOPE OF, THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.  </b></p>
<p>Aquasana's Water 4 Life® program guarantees a lifetime warranty on all parts and workmanship for all Shower Water Filters and Drinking Water Filters that are current on their subscriptions on the Water 4 Life® program. Aquasana will repair or replace any broken or defective part for no charge other than a flat rate shipping charge of $9.50 for any warranty claim on any Aquasana Shower Water Filter or Aquasana Drinking Water Filter that is enrolled in the Aquasana Water 4 Life® program.</p>
