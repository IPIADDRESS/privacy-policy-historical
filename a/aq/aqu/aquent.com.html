      <p>Aquent is committed to safeguarding the privacy of the Users of its Web site. This Privacy Policy sets forth Aquent’s policies regarding the collection and treatment of personally identifiable information. </p>
      <p> “Site” refers to this Internet Web site (<a href="http://www.aquent.com/"> www.Aquent.com</a>) and other Aquent Web sites linked to this Site. The Site acts as a venue for delivery of Aquent applications (listed here by way of example only) for 1) individuals currently working with Aquent (i.e., “active Users”) to interact with Aquent’s database and enter timecards, create and manage their Aquent Profiles, check benefits information, view schedules and assignment information, and process other information; 2) Aquent to process orders, send newsletters, perform customer service; qualify candidates for possible employment; 3) Aquent’s clients to search portfolios, run financial reports, sign timecards; and 4) members of the public to receive marketing campaigns and inquiries. <br>

Such data may be retained for several reasons, including backups for disaster recovery planning, dispute resolution purposes, troubleshooting, and enforcement of agreements. Aquent reserves the right to correct personally identifiable data to make it current and consistent with data directly input by Users, for example, when the User updates his/her address on his/her resume but not elsewhere.</p>
