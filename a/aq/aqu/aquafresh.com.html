<h3><u>GlaxoSmithKline Internet Privacy Statement</u></h3>

GSK respects the privacy of visitors to our online sites.  GSK will only collect personally identifiable data, such as
your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, when it is voluntarily submitted to us at this website. This
statement discloses the privacy practices of GSK.  By using the GSK website, the user agrees, without limitation or
qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Statement.  This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time so
please check back periodically.  GSK and/or the companies we hire and are affiliated with will use this information to
comply with your requests for information and to better serve you.  We will refer to your information to better
understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services.  We may use that information to contact you.
We are the sole owner of information you voluntarily submit to us.  We will not sell or otherwise transfer the
personally identifiable information you provide at this website to any third party except as set forth in this Privacy
Statement.
<p>
This privacy statement applies to the collection and use of information by
our company on this website, but does not apply to the information which you
may send to us by other means.

This GSK website also uses information in aggregate form to track the total number of visitors to our site, the number
of visitors to each page of our site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers.  No personally
identifiable information is available in this process.  Some GSK websites use a technology called "cookies".  A cookie
is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access a website.  Cookies are capable of storing many types of
data.  Cookies help provide additional functionality to the site or to help us analyze site usage more accurately. For
instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to
one of our sites.  In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable
information except with notice to you.

This GSK website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally
identifiable data from any person we know to be under the age of 13 and instruct children under 13 not to send us any
information.

Users from the European Union are advised not to disclose personal information to GSK.

As a convenience to our visitors, GSK's sites currently contain links to a number of sites that we believe may offer
useful information.  The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites.  We suggest
contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies.  Any changes to
this GSK Internet Privacy Statement will be promptly communicated on this page.

Access to Your Information
</p><p>
In the event that GSK and some of our assets are sold or transferred or used as security, the information collected on
our website may be transferred to third parties as part of that transaction.  GSK may also provide information or
provide access to information to any of our affiliated businesses or to our business partners.
</p><p>

GSK may use contact information provided by the user to reply to the user and send information to the user. GSK does
not intend to reveal individually identifiable information to third parties except in the manner stated in the Privacy
Statement.  GSK will provide aggregated information received from users to third parties.  GSK takes commercially
reasonable precautions to prevent the aggregated information provided to third parties from including significant
individually identifiable information.
</p><p>
If GSK is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users,
GSK may, without your consent, provide such information.  In matters involving claims of personal or public safety,
GSK may provide a user's personal information to appropriate authorities without your consent or court process.
</p><p>
Will Your Information Be Secure?
</p><p>
GSK recognizes that visitors to our websites are concerned about the security of their personal information, and we
are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our website.  However, even
with the best technology, no website is 100% secure.  We will take reasonable measures which we believe are
appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will
ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security.
