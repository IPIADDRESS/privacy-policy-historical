<br>
<p>Some jurisdictions require a legal basis to use or process your personal information. In most cases the legal basis will be one of the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>to fulfill our contractual obligations to you in connection with your policy or contract with us, for example using your contact details to reply to your requests. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these contractual obligations;</li>

  <li>where there is a public interest in the processing, for example where it is necessary in order to prevent and detect fraud; and</li>
  <li>to meet our or a third party's legitimate interests, for example to understand how you use our services and to enable us to derive knowledge from that to develop new services, to protect our rights or the rights of third parties, or to resolve any disputes. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place robust safeguards to help ensure that your privacy is protected and that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>We may also obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of personal information, including when we are required to do so by law (for example, in certain jurisdictions where consent is always required to collect personal information, or in relation to our direct marketing activities or use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies, or when we process sensitive personal information about you).

<h6>4. AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU</h6>
<p>We may automatically process your personal information to make decisions or conduct 'profiling' about you. This may involve using software that is able to evaluate your personal aspects and predict risks or outcomes. We may carry out this automatic processing for general business purposes including, for example, advertising, risk assessment or fraud prevention. The processing may involve decisions about you that relate to products that we sponsor or your eligibility to use the Services. The significance of our actions in this connection is that is that it may have legal or similar effects for you, namely, availability of access to services. The logic involved may be related to our cookies policy, or it may be related to specific underwriting software, for example.</p>
<p>We will only make these kinds of automated decisions about you where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>such decisions are necessary for entering into a contract. For example, we may decide not to offer Services to you, or we may decide on the types or amount of Services that are suitable for you, or how much to charge you for our Services based on your credit history and other financial or related information we have collected about you;</li>
  <li>such decisions are required or authorized by law, for example for fraud prevention purposes; or</li>
  <li>you give your consent to us carrying out automated decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Subject to local legal requirements and limitations, you can contact us to request further information about automated decision-making, object to our use of automated decision-making, or request an automated decision to be reviewed by a human being.</p>
<p>We also may make automated decisions about you based on your personal information in the circumstances such as: to select personalized offers, discounts or recommendations to send you based on your shopping history or browsing history, subject to any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
<p>These types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects for you, but you can still contact us for further information.</p>

<h6>6. INFORMATION SECURITY AND STORAGE</h6>
<p>We implement technical, organizational, administrative and physical measures to help ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to the personal information we collect, use, disclose and process.
