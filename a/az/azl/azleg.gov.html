			<p>This website is designed as a public service and as such we do not collect 
  any personal data without your knowledge.</p>
			<p>If you only browse the website during your visit and input no data, we collect 
  no personal information about you. As you visit our web site software automatically 
  collects and stores only the following information about your visit, mostly

			<p>Software programs are used to create summary statistics from this information 
  for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, 
  determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance 
  or problem areas.</p>
			<p>We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide 
  it to us by sending us e-mail, or completing an on-line form. You may choose 
  not to contact us by e-mail, or provide any personal information using an on-line

  ability to browse this Web site and read or download any information provided

			<p>The site does use Internet cookies, however, session variables (e.g. an active connection 
between a user and the website) are used to keep track of information about your visit to the website.
  For example, it tracks what Legislative session you're currently working with.  The cookies are temporary

			<p>If the user volunteers personal information, the federal Privacy Act of 1974 
  may protect it. However, this information may be considered public record, and 
  may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal 
  or state law.</p>
			<p>In the State of Arizona, laws exist to ensure that government is open, and 
  the public has a right to access most records and information possessed by state 
  government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to 
  access public records that serve various needs, including the privacy of individuals. 
  Both state and federal laws provide exceptions.</p>

  Web site and has taken steps to safeguard the integrity of its data, and prevent 
  unauthorized access to information maintained. </p>
