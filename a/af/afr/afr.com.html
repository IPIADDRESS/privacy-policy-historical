                        <br><br>
                        You may, however, elect to tell us things that you want us to remember. We hope that, like many of our users and customers, you will want to provide information about yourself to the f2 Network because it will help us to make our sites and services more valuable to you.
                        <br><br>
                        The choice of how much personally identifiable information about yourself you disclose to the f2 Network is left completely up to you, our valued customer. But however you choose to interact with the f2 Network, you have our commitment to your privacy, as stated above.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>What information does the f2 Network gather?</b>
                        <ul>
                        <li> If you are comfortable providing us with information about yourself, enhanced services, like forums, become available to you, but in most cases it
                        will not be possible for us to offer them to anonymous users.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> In some instances where we are selling products and services to you we require financial information as well as personal information. All the information we gather is stored by f2 on a secure site protected by state of the art 'firewalls' and never shared with anyone.
                        <br><br>
            </li><li>We track traffic patterns throughout sites.
            <br><br>
                        </li><li> We may use a feature of your browser called a "cookie" to assign a "User ID."  Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out your
                        identity or the identities' of any of our users, it only identifies your computer to our servers when you visit our site.<br><br>
            </li><li>Companies placing advertising on our sites and the sites of other web publishers may have the ability to assign a different cookie to you by a process that the f2 Network does not control. 
                        </li></ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>You are in control of all information gathered about you</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Our 'open book' information policy means you can access all the information you have given us and make any changes you deem appropriate.  Membership details, such as Ad Alert registrations, are of course user name and password protected so that only you or someone you have authorized can gain access to this information.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>Why do we gather the information and how will we use it?</b>
                        <br>
                         The f2 Network aims to provide you with better services and more compelling reasons to come back and visit our 
sites:
                        <ul>
                        <li> In the future, we may use the information you provide us with to provide personalised portions of our sites to you that are intended to provide just the information you are interested in receiving.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> We analyse what our users and customers like and don't like about the content, products and services on f2 sites so that we can constantly improve them for your use.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> In the future, we may also use information you have given us to help focus the advertisements that are shown on our sites, hopefully to make them of more interest to you.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> We develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers.  An example of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked on advertisement "X" today and they were in the headlines section of the site." The people that help make it possible for the f2 Network to provide our sites for free - our advertisers - use this information to determine how effective their advertising investments are. We do not tell our advertisers who it was that saw or clicked on their advertisements and do not sell, trade or rent them any of your personal information.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> Occasionally, we will send you e-mail communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including information about new products and services from the f2 Network. It is our policy only to send e-mail to customers who give us permission to do so. In every such e-mail, we will also have instructions on how you may unsubscribe from the e-mail list so that you will not receive any future e-mails if you do not wish to - see the "Opt-out Policy " below.
                        </li></ul>
                        <br>

                        <b>Security. Is my information safe?</b>
                        <br><br>
                        When you place orders or access your membership information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected by state-of-the-art 'firewalls' against unauthorized access.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <b>Opt-In/Opt-Out policy</b>
                        <br><br>
                        The f2 Network puts control over communications directed to you where it belongs, in your hands:
                        <ul>
                        <li> We only send our e-mail newsletters to users who ask to receive them.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> Once you are on the list - you can easily get off. Each e-mail newsletter you receive has simple instructions on how to immediately unsubscribe from our newsletter list. To do this you must use the e-mail addresses you specified at the time of becoming a Member or joining an e-mail newsletter list.
                        <br><br>
                        </li><li> If you change or move e-mail addresses please let us know so we can redirect your e-mail to your new address.
                        </li></ul>
                        <br>
