		<p><strong>Security and Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Last Update January 1st 2011</p>
<p>AfroFood Inc. ( “us,” “our,” or “we”) strives to offer the visitors to all of our websites, including but not limited to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.afrofoodtv.com/" target="_blank">http://www.afrofoodtv.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.afrofood.com/" target="_blank">http://www.afrofood.com</a> and  all subdomains of such websites, as well as all services related to  such websites (such websites and services, collectively, the “Site”) the  many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive  and personalized experience. In order to do this, we may, at times, use  “Personally Identifiable Information” (any information that can be used  to identify a specific individual, such as a name, postal address,  telephone number or email address) subject to the terms of this  statement (“Policy”). Please note that this Policy applies only to  information collected by us and does not impact information collected or  used by AfroFood, its subsidiaries, or its affiliates through other  means. By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What types of Personally Identifiable Information does AfroFood collect on the Site?</strong></p>
<p>How  we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services  provided. For instance, you may choose to become a member of the Site  (“Member”) in order to participate in certain activities on the Site and  enjoy special benefits offered only to Members. To become a Member, you  are required to sign in by providing your name, postal address, and  email address. You will also be asked to create a Username and password.  You may also be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information in  connection with sweepstakes, contests, raffles, games and similar  promotions on the Site, as well as in connection with surveys and other  Site activities.</p>
<p>Visitors  who wish to purchase products from the Site will also be asked to  provide their shipping and/or delivery (if different from the postal  address) addresses, telephone number and credit card information.</p>
<p>Members  who choose to participate in the “Community” or “Share” section of the  Site will have the opportunity to share ideas and thoughts about various  topics with other Members, and create a user profile. Community/Share  consists of a user profile, Bulletin Board service (such as message  boards on the Site), Q&amp;A Hours, and other interactive services we  may offer from time to time, including the ability to comment, rate,  recommend, and note. Use of Community/Share is governed by the Site’s  Terms of Use. Use of Community/Share is governed by the Site’s&nbsp;<a href="../../../../../?pid=317&amp;sid=84dd6f" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.  Community/Share is accessible by all Members, and users of this service  should be mindful that any information posted to Community/Share will  become public information and will be available to other participating  Members and visitors to the Site. Accordingly, if you choose to  participate in Community/Share, and post information to this section of  the Site, please use discretion. You must create a name (“Username”) to  use and access the Community/Share section.</p>
<p><strong>Does AfroFood collect any other information about visitors to the Site?</strong></p>
<p>We  constantly seek to make improvements to the Site. As part of these  efforts, we collect and analyze certain “Aggregate Information”  (information that does not allow us to identify a specific individual  such as demographic information, purchase categories (e.g., home  furnishings), or visitors using a particular browser to access the Site)  about how visitors use the Site.</p>
<p>When  you visit our Site, we may collect various types of technical data.  This data includes (but is not limited to) domain and/or Web browser  information. We may track which Web site you visited before arriving at  the Site and the Web site you link to when you leave the Site. We may  also keep a record of which pages of the Site you visit, and how long  you spend on each page.</p>
<p>We  also use “cookies” and other technologies on the Site. Cookies are  small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor’s  computer hard drive to enable that person to more easily communicate and  interact with the Site and to provide us with important information on  how visitors use the Site. For example, we will place a cookie on a  visitor’s computer when he/she visits the Site. The next time that  person visits the Site using the same computer, our server will  recognize the cookie and the visitor. We will also use cookies to  collect information about a Member who visits the Site without  signing-in (or who signs-out but continues visiting the Site). Further,  cookies and other technologies are used in email messages sent by our  email delivery and marketing company and at our website to help us  measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our  site. With respect to ads, information about your visits to this site,  such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name,  address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you.  For more information about how to “opt-out” of these ad cookies, please&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx" target="_blank">click here</a>.  Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may  change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when  a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however,  that rejecting cookies while visiting the Site may result in certain  parts of the Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they  were allowed. Cookies must be enabled in order to register with the  Site.</p>
<p><strong>What does AfroFood do with Personally Identifiable Information collected on the Site?</strong></p>
<p>We  collect and use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to  enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and  advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information  collected on the Site to communicate with you regarding products and  services offered by AfroFood and our affiliates and partners and other  topics we think you might find of interest; in the administration of  sweepstakes, contests or other promotions; and to process e-commerce  transactions.</p>
<p>In  addition, we use Personally Identifiable Information, such as your  purchase information, to improve the performance of our Site, to  customize the content and layout of our Site pages for you and to inform  you of new areas of the Site and product specials.</p>
<p><strong>What does AfroFood do with Aggregate Information collected on the Site?</strong></p>
<p>Aggregate  Information collected on the Site may be used and disclosed in any  way.&nbsp; For example, we may collect and analyze collected Aggregate  Information to determine how many visitors arrived at certain pages of  the Site, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went  afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be  the most interesting to our visitors and enables us to provide them  with a better and richer experience on the Site. Additionally, we may  use Aggregate Information to improve the performance of our Site, and to  customize the content and layout of our Site pages for you.</p>
<p>As  a further example, occasionally, we share Aggregate Information with  third parties, such as our advertisers and business partners, for  marketing and promotional purposes. Aggregate Information gleaned from  your use of the Site may also be used to inform you of new areas of the  Site and product specials.</p>
<p>We  may supplement Aggregate Information collected from the Site with  similar information obtained from our affiliates, companies with whom we  have marketing or other business relationships, and other third party  sources.</p>
<p>Please  note that certain Aggregate Information may be linked with Personally  Identifiable Information. Any such linked information will be treated as  Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes of this Policy as  long as it is so linked.</p>
<p><strong>Does AfroFood share information with other companies?</strong></p>
<p>Certain  activities and services available on the Site are provided by third  parties. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with  third parties for the purpose of enabling such third parties to provide  such activities, services or products. For example, if you choose to  purchase a product from us, we may use outside vendors to process your  credit card, or to process and ship the order to you. In these  instances, we would need to provide certain Personally Identifiable  Information, such as your credit card information and shipping address,  to these vendors.</p>
<p>We  may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles, games and similar  promotions through the Site. We typically ask you for certain Personally  Identifiable Information when you enter and, if applicable, win a  sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game or similar promotion. We reserve the  right to share this Personally Identifiable Information with third party  sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles, games and promotions  (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance  with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest, raffle, game or  promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes,  contest, raffle, game and promotion in which you participate through the  Site, as they may contain additional important information about  AfroFood’s or a sponsor’s use of your Personally Identifiable  Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules  concerning the treatment of your Personally Identifiable Information  conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall  control.</p>
<p>We  use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you  have agreed to receive, in which case we will provide certain Personally  Identifiable Information, including your email address, to the  marketing company.</p>
<p>We  reserve the right to share both Personally Identifiable Information and  Aggregate Information with other AfroFood businesses and our  subsidiaries. We also share Personally Identifiable Information about  visitors and Members with third-party companies with whom we have a  marketing or other business relationship. California residents may opt  out of allowing us to share Personally Identifiable Information about  them with our affiliates and third parties for their marketing purposes.  For more information on how to communicate your preferences to us,  please see the section below entitled “<a href="../../../../../?pid=317&amp;sid=84dd6f" target="_blank">What are my “opt-out” choices?</a>”</p>
<p>Please  be aware that on certain portions of the Site, Personally Identifiable  Information may be collected and used by both AfroFood and the third  party who operates that portion of the site.&nbsp; We will inform you of such  dual collection at the point that we collect such Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; Additionally, if you choose to provide  Personally Identifiable Information through that portion of the Site, we  may share additional Personally Identifiable Information, (e.g., your  email address), with the third party to permit them to better serve  you.&nbsp; In other instances, we may operate certain programs in conjunction  with a third party.&nbsp; If we do so, we will inform you that both AfroFood  and one or more third parties are collecting your Personally  Identifiable Information in connection with these programs, or that  AfroFood will be providing your Personally Identifiable Information to  one or more third parties in connection with these programs.&nbsp; Please be  aware that AfroFood’s use of Personally Identifiable Information will be  governed by this Policy and the third party’s use of Personally  Identifiable Information will be governed by the third party’s  policy. &nbsp;AfroFood has no control over, and is not responsible or liable  for, any third party’s use and/or disclosure of your Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; If you would prefer that these third parties  not have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, please do  not provide any Personally Identifiable Information through these  portions of the Site or in connection with these programs.</p>
<p>Further,  other portions of the Site (e.g., when you make a purchase through  Amazon through the Site) may be operated exclusively by a third party,  and if you provide Personally Identifiable Information through such  portions of the Site, such Personally Identifiable Information will be  collected and used by the third party in accordance with such third  party’s privacy policy, and not by AfroFood. &nbsp;AfroFood has no control  over, and is not responsible or liable for, for any third party’s use  and/or disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp; If you  would prefer that these third parties not have access to your Personally  Identifiable Information, please do not provide any Personally  Identifiable Information through these portions of the Site.</p>
<p>We  may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to: (1)  comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or  requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights,  privacy, safety or property of AfroFood; (5) to permit us to pursue  available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) to  enforce our&nbsp;<a href="../../../../../?pid=317&amp;sid=84dd6f" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>In  the event there is a change in the corporate structure of AfroFood such  as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation, or  transfer of substantial assets, AfroFood may, in its sole discretion,  transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Site,  including without limitation, Personally Identifiable Information  concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third  parties.</p>
<p>In  addition, we may allow third party service providers such as  advertisers, website statistics gatherers and others to use cookies and  other technologies to, among other things, serve advertisements, collect  statistics about use of the Site and enable such third parties to  record information such as your browser type, IP address, which ads your  browser has seen, which Site pages you may have been viewing when ads  were delivered, your referring URL, your geographic location and other  interaction information (but not your name or address). AfroFood does  not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and  is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p><strong>If I link to another Web site and provide information to that Web site, how will that information be handled?</strong></p>
<p>This  Site may contain links to third party Web sites, including, but not  limited to, the Web sites of companies with whom we have business or  marketing relationships such as companies that sell products and  services. If you link to a third party Web site, you will leave this  Site and this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on,  those other Web sites. If you provide Personally Identifiable  Information to any such third party Web site, your transaction will  occur on such third party’s Web site (not this Site) and the Personally  Identifiable Information you provide will be collected by, and  controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We encourage you  to read the legal notices posted on those third party Web sites,  including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or  liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use  practices of, such third party Web sites. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY  DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD  PARTIES.</p>
<p><strong>How does AfroFood protect the information I provide to the Site?</strong></p>
<p>We  take reasonable precautions to safeguard the Personally Identifiable  Information transmitted between visitors and the Site and the Personally  Identifiable Information stored on our servers. We use Secured Socket  Layers encryption for the transmission of data to our servers during  member registration, sign in and order check out. Unfortunately, no  method of transmitting or storing data over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect  your Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot ensure the security  of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the  Site. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no  longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any  account you might have with us has been compromised), you must  immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=customerservice@afrofood.com" target="_blank">customerservice@afrofood.com</a>.</p>
<p>In  the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally  Identifiable Information in our possession or control may have been  compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a  notification is, in our sole discretion, appropriate, we would endeavor  to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the  extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email.</p>
<p>If  you receive an email or other correspondence requesting that you  provide any sensitive information (including your Site password or  credit card information) via email or to a web site that does not seem  to be affiliated with the Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to  you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to  us at&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=customerservice@afrofood.com" target="_blank">customerservice@afrofood.com</a>.</p>

<p>Please  note, however, that if you “opt out” as described above, we will not be  able to remove Personally Identifiable Information about you from the  databases of affiliates or third parties with which we have already  shared such Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., to which we have  already provided Personally Identifiable Information as of the date of  your opt-out request). If you wish to cease receiving marketing messages  from such affiliates or third parties, please contact such affiliates  or third parties directly or utilize the opt-out mechanisms set forth in  their respective privacy policies or marketing messages.</p>
