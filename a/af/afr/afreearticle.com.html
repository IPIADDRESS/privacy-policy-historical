<p class="articletitle">AFreeArticle.com Privacy Policy</p>

<p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>Last Updated: July 22,
2006<br><br>AFreeArticle.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy
policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any
unauthorized third party. Period."<br><br><b>How we gather information from
users</b><br><br>How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and
other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, AFreeArticle.com
also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools
that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your
user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a
particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain
cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting
your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to
access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according
to your preferences.<br><br><b>What we do with the information we
collect</b><br><br>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br><br>Aggregated
Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in
many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns
with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and
services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most
attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our
advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you
individually.<br><br>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
AFreeArticle.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by AFreeArticle.com and other topics we think you might
find of interest.<br><br>Personally Identifiable Information collected by
AFreeArticle.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not
limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce
transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other
communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for
the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such
information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy,
merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are
reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of
amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we
deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice
prior to disclosure in such cases.<br><br><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and
advertisements</b><br><br>AFreeArticle.com expects its partners, advertisers
and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that
third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site
you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a AFreeArticle.com page,
certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,
through AFreeArticle.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. AFreeArticle.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of
such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those
third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a
third party.<br><br>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable
the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
AFreeArticle.com does not control the use of this technology by third
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or
policies of such third parties.<br><br>You should also be aware that if you
voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and
used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the
control of AFreeArticle.com and this
policy.<br><br><b>Children</b><br><br>AFreeArticle.com does not knowingly
collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children
under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any
information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete
that information immediately. If you believe AFreeArticle.com has any
information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address
listed below.<br><br>Contacting Us.<br><br>We can be reached by
contacting:<br><br>AFreeArticle.com<br><br>Email:
articles@AFreeArticle.com<br><br>Changes to this
Policy<br><br>AFreeArticle.com reserves the right to change this policy at
any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will
be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.<br> </p>
