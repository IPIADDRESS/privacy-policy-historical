<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Dashnine Media we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We cant stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for 
no apparent reason.)</li>
  <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
  <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</h4>

<p>Like most website operators, Dashnine Media collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make 
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  Dashnine Media's purpose in 
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Dashnine Media's visitors use its website. From time to time, Dashnine Media 
may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Dashnine Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Dashnine Media does not use such 
information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses 
personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>Certain visitors to Dashnine Media's websites choose to interact with Dashnine Media in ways that require Dashnine Media to gather personally-identifying 
information.   The amount and type of information that Dashnine Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  Those who engage in transactions 
with Dashnine Media by purchasing access to the After the Deadline writing improvement service, for example are asked to provide additional information, including as 
necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.  In each case, Dashnine Media collects such information only insofar 
as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors interaction with Dashnine Media.  Dashnine Media does not disclose 
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the 
caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

</p><h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

<p>Dashnine Media may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.  Dashnine Media may display this information publicly or provide it 
to others. However, Dashnine Media does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

<p>Dashnine Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and 
affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Dashnine Media's behalf or to provide services available at 
Dashnine Media's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be 
located outside of your home country; by using Dashnine Media's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.  <u>Dashnine Media <b>will 
not</b> rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone</u>. Other than to its employees, contractors and 
affiliated organizations, as described above, Dashnine Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when 
required to do so by law, or when Dashnine Media believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Dashnine 
Media, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Dashnine Media website and have supplied your email address, Dashnine Media 
may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Dashnine Media 
and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If 
you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify 
or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Dashnine Media takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized 
access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the 
visitor returns.  Dashnine Media uses cookies to help Dashnine Media identify and track visitors, their usage of any Dashnine Media website, and their 
website access preferences.   Dashnine Media visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before 
using Dashnine Media websites, with the drawback that certain features of Dashnine Media's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Dashnine Media may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Dashnine Media's sole discretion. 
Dashnine Media encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.  Your continued use of this site after any change in 
this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
