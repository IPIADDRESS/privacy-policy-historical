<p><strong><a id="WIRELESS" name="WIRELESS"></a>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wireless Marketing Services and Associated Promotional Opportunities. </strong></p>
<p>Logo may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Logo, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.&nbsp; Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Logo.&nbsp; The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.&nbsp; Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. <strong></strong></p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for Logo’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Logo.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.&nbsp; <strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, Logo, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration.&nbsp; </strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Logo’s wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Logo depending on the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Logo will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Logo to send text messages to him or her. Logo will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Logo or by sending a text message to Logo that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively consent to Logo’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Logo) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.afterellen.com/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong> before the online registration process is completed. Logo will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Logo to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided that</span> Logo may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; Logo will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Logo to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong> </strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that Logo may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Logo by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Logo at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp; Logo will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with Logo.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Logo service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Termination of Wireless Services by </strong>Logo<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Logo may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.&nbsp; Logo may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>d.&nbsp; Use of Information.&nbsp; </strong>Logo will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use.&nbsp; We will not share any Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure.&nbsp; We will share Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates. <br> <br> <strong><a id="SHARING" name="SHARING"></a>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information.</strong><br> <strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information.</strong></p>

We may share&nbsp;your Personal Information with our Co-Branded&nbsp;Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature&nbsp;means that you opt-in and give your&nbsp;affirmative consent to&nbsp;both the Site and our&nbsp;Co-Branded Partner to collect the Information provided in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service and to use such Information for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative purposes.&nbsp; The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded feature or service, along with the Co-Branded partner’s privacy policy.&nbsp; If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes,&nbsp;you will need to&nbsp;contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner’s privacy policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (<em>e.g.,</em> to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;</li>
<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.afterellen.com/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, Rules or Additional Terms;</li>

<p><strong><a id="REVIEW" name="REVIEW"></a>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Certain Information.&nbsp; </strong><br> Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking “MY ACCOUNT” on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID and then clicking on "YOUR ACCOUNT INFO" to change, update, or delete your Personal Information. &nbsp;However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.&nbsp; We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.&nbsp; <br> Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><br> If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.&nbsp; <strong> </strong><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children or Ineligible Teenagers</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ineligible Teenagers</span>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parent</span>”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.&nbsp; The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership [must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.afterellen.com/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></span></strong>&nbsp; to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively, Parents] may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID.&nbsp; If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.&nbsp; The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Logo will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.&nbsp; Logo will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><a id="PROTECT" name="PROTECT"></a>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of Information.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phishing</span></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials.&nbsp; “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.&nbsp; <strong>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!</strong>&nbsp; If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at <strong>privacy-admin@logostaff.com</strong>, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.&nbsp;</p>
