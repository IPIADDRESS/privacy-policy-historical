</p>
<p>
Logo may provide users and viewers with  the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming  and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as  mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their  consent to receive such information from Logo, either by  registering on the Site or via their wireless device.  Such services and promotional opportunities  are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Logo.  The Information requested as part of the  online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless  email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.  Additional Information may be requested for  specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services,  choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.  Depending on the Promotion, we may also  collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information  collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this  Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. 
</p>
<p>
We caution  that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of  an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal  Information when using a wireless communications device.
</p>
<p>
Users that register for Logo’s wireless  marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will<b> </b>be charged by the user’s wireless  carrier for all messages sent to the user from Logo.  Standard messaging rates will apply, unless  noted otherwise.  <b>Under no circumstances will the Site, </b>Logo<b>, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible  for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a  person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email  address. </b>
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	<b>a.   Registration.  </b>To the extent we provide wireless  marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Logo’s wireless  marketing services.   Standard rate  Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in”  (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Logo depending on  the type of Promotion.  Premium rate  services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<b>i.          Single Opt-in Method:</b>  In response to print, radio, television,  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a  specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to  register for the service promoted.  The  user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Logo will mean that  the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Logo to send text  messages to him or her. Logo will thank the  user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.  The user may terminate the service at any  time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Logo or by sending  a text message to Logo that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”,  “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.  
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>ii.         Double  Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</b>   In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional  messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration  process.  The user must affirmatively  consent to Logo’s sending of wireless messages to  his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or  wireless email address, only if requested by Logo) and by  clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.  The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and <u><a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a></u> before the online registration process is completed. Logo will then send  a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will  request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from  Logo to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain  name when appropriate). The user  must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states  “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless  marketing service.  Until the user  responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the  specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation”  message at any time <u>provided that</u> Logo may choose to  terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s  response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to  offer the specific wireless marketing service.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>iii.        Double Opt-in  (SMS/SMS) Method:</b>  In response  to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users  will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a  designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.  Logo will then send  a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will  request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages  from Logo to that particular telephone  number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<b> </b>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text  message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless  marketing service.  Until the user  responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the  specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.  A user may respond to the “Confirmation”  message at any time provided that Logo may choose to  terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s  response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to  offer the specific wireless marketing service.  
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	<b><a id="TERMINATION" name="TERMINATION" title="TERMINATION"></a>b.   Termination of Wireless Services by User.</b>  Regardless of which one of the above opt-in  methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive  messages from Logo by the following procedure: 
	</p>
	<p>
	A user may cancel one or more  services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe  mechanism provided by Logo at the time  the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”,  “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.   Logo will terminate the user’s  registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.  Any of these words followed by the word “ALL”  in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered  wireless services with Logo.  If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Logo service(s) via  his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and  will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>c.</b>  <b>Termination of Wireless Services  by </b>Logo<b>.</b>  A user understands, acknowledges and agrees  that Logo may, in its sole discretion and  without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless  marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without  advance notice.  Logo may provide  notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>d.  Use of  Information.  </b>Logo will not use a  wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or  other Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other  purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice  of any other use.  We will not share any Personal  Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in  to such disclosure.  We will share  Personal Information with the operational service providers that assist us in  delivering these wireless services to you and with the Parent Companies and  Affiliates.

<b><a id="REVIEWING" name="REVIEWING" title="REVIEWING"></a>7.         Reviewing,  Updating or Deleting Certain Information.  </b><br>
Generally, you may review, update  or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered  user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking “Profile” or your  display name at the top of the Site and then selecting “Edit Profile”.  However, Personal Information that is  necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be  deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct  information.  We  will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as  certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information  current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change  that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with  your User ID.  <br>
Certain Information  collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and  regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s  request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.<b>  </b><br>
If the burden or  expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the  risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated,  we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will  provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information  for further inquiries.
</p>
<p>
<b><u>Children or Ineligible Teenagers</u></b><b>.</b>  If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently  send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other  eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age  of 13) or others who do not meet  the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“<u>Ineligible  Teenagers</u>”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or  Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “<u>Parent</u>”) always has  the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text  messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.  The same unsubscribe process is available to  a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age  of majority in your state).  
</p>
<p>
In  addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their  child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or  Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow  the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use”  Section of the <a href="/terms"><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></a> to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively,  Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us  with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate  your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.  We will not allow direct access  to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s  User ID.  If a Parent does not have his  or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to  send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name,  address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible  Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or  Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.  The  Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or  legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Logo will  send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify  that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s  account and registration.  The Parent  must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return  address.  Logo will  then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the  child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will  identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.

</p>
<p>
While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from  intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and  procedural safeguards to protect your Information.  However, regardless of our efforts and the  Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may  unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an  unsecured transmission.  We conduct  financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other  parts of the Site.  We also limit access  to the Site by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for  the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our  standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary  processes.  We request that our  operational service providers follow similar standards of security and  confidentiality.

<b><u>Phishing</u></b><b>.</b>  Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’  personal identity data and financial account credentials.  “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ e-mails to lead  consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging  Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and  social security numbers.  <b>WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE  OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR  PASSWORD!</b>  If you receive such email  communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy  Administrator at <a href="mailto://privacy-admin@afterellen.com" target="_blank"><u>privacy-admin@afterellen.com</u></a>, and then immediately delete the  fraudulent email from your computer.
