<p>This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “Device”) and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user (if offered by the Site) or other user of the Site.</p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy&nbsp;governs only the&nbsp;Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner (such as by the Logo Channel not through the Site) or by any other website offered by Logo, the Parent Companies and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of the Parent Companies (collectively, “Affiliates”) or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from our Parent Companies, Affiliates, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity.&nbsp;“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Site and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons” and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
<p>We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the&nbsp;Site&nbsp;and for other purposes described in the “Use of Information”, “<strong><a href="http://www.thebacklot.com/privacy-policy/#OTHERINFOCOLLECT">Other Information Collected by Us</a></strong>” section below.

<p>Logo may provide users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required to provide their consent to receive such information from Logo, either by registering on the Site or via their wireless device.&nbsp; Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by the Parent Companies and/or Affiliates for Logo.&nbsp; The Information requested as part of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s name.&nbsp; Additional Information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information.&nbsp; Depending on the Promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and, depending on the Information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for Logo’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Logo.&nbsp; Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Under no circumstances will the Site, Logo, its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</strong></p>
<p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there are two registration methods provided for Logo’s wireless marketing services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of Logo depending on the type of Promotion.&nbsp; Premium rate services will require the “double opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p><strong>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Opt-in Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; The user’s voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Logo will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Logo to send text messages to him or her. Logo will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message.&nbsp; The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Logo or by sending a text message to Logo that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.</p>
<p><strong>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process.&nbsp; The user must affirmatively consent to Logo’s sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Logo) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page.&nbsp; The user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thebacklot.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Terms of Use Agreement</a>&nbsp;before the online registration process is completed. Logo will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Logo to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time&nbsp;<em>provided that</em>&nbsp;Logo may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong>&nbsp; In response to print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted.&nbsp; Logo will then send a “Confirmation” message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Logo to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate).<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of Logo’s wireless marketing service.&nbsp; Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion.&nbsp; A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided that Logo may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only valid if the response is received while Logo continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; Termination of Wireless Services by User.</strong>&nbsp; Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Logo by the following procedure:</p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Logo at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”.&nbsp; Logo will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user.&nbsp; Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s registered wireless services with Logo.&nbsp; If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Logo service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Termination of Wireless Services by&nbsp;</strong>Logo<strong>.</strong>&nbsp; A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Logo may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice.&nbsp; Logo may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>

Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking “MY ACCOUNT” on the homepage to sign in to your Site account with your User ID and then clicking on “YOUR ACCOUNT INFO” to change, update, or delete your Personal Information. &nbsp;However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.&nbsp; We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID.</p>
<p>Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.</p>
<p>If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Children or Ineligible Teenagers.</strong>&nbsp; If we, or our Parent Companies or Affiliates, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“Ineligible Teenagers”), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child’s (or Ineligible Teenager’s) parent or legal guardian (the “Parent”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.&nbsp; The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).</p>
<p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership [must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the “Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use” Section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.afterellen.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use Agreement</a>&nbsp;to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s member; alternatively, Parents] may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth.&nbsp; The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. Logo will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration.&nbsp; The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.&nbsp; Logo will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>
