<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
Updated January 19th, 2012
<p>
This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers all websites (such as awesome-ship.com) owned and operated by AFTERSHIP LTD ("AFTERSHIP", "we", "us", "our") and all associated services provided by AFTERSHIP. This Privacy Policy covers AFTERSHIP's treatment of personal information that it gathers when you access or use any of AFTERSHIP's websites or services. This policy also covers personal information that AFTERSHIP's business partners share with AFTERSHIP.
</p>
<p>Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our websites, submitting information or using any of our services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>AFTERSHIP knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. This is how we want to be treated, too.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h2>Collection in General</h2>
<h2>Information We Automatically Collect</h2>
<p>We may receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with us, including, without limitation, the sort information that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AFTERSHIP's purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how AFTERSHIP's visitors use its website. From time to time, AFTERSHIP may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. AFTERSHIP also collects potentially personally-identifying information like the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of website visitors.
</p>
<h2>Information You Provide To Us</h2>
<p>We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. For example, in order to use certain services or functions of our websites, you may be required to register with an email address on the AFTERSHIP website. AFTERSHIP collects such information only insofar as is it deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction with AFTERSHIP.
</p>
<p>You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities.
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. AFTERSHIP uses cookies to help AFTERSHIP identify and track visitors, their usage of AFTERSHIP website, and their website access preferences. AFTERSHIP visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using AFTERSHIP's websites, with the drawback that certain features of AFTERSHIP's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<h2>Deleting a AFTERSHIP account</h2>
<p>All statistics and logs collected on behalf of an account holder are purged upon deletion of a AFTERSHIP account, although AFTERSHIP may retain such information for longer periods of time as part of its back-up emergency system.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share your personal information only with your consent or to our business partners and affiliates as described below:
</p>
<h2>Personnel/Agents</h2>
<p>AFTERSHIP discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, agents and contractors that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AFTERSHIP's behalf or to provide services available at or through AFTERSHIP's websites and services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, agents and contractors may be located outside of your home country; by using AFTERSHIP's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
</p>
<h2>Affiliated Businesses</h2>
<p>We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them in order to provide our services to users. We will only share personal information with affiliates to the extent that is necessary for such affiliates to provide the services. For example, when an ad is displayed on AFTERSHIP, the IP address of the viewer may be shared with AFTERSHIP's advertising partners. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized transaction. Some of our affiliates may be located outside of your home country; by using AFTERSHIP's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
</p>
<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If AFTERSHIP or substantially all of its assets were transferred or acquired (for example, in the case of a merger or acquisition) customer information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
</p>
<h2>Other Disclosures</h2>
<p>AFTERSHIP may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information when AFTERSHIP believe in good faith that release is required by law, court order, or when AFTERSHIP believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AFTERSHIP, third parties or the public at large.
</p>
<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that AFTERSHIP does not own or control, or to individuals that AFTERSHIP does not employ or manage. AFTERSHIP websites may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the AFTERSHIP websites. These other websites are not under AFTERSHIP control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the AFTERSHIP website are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and AFTERSHIP is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>If you are a registered member of a AFTERSHIP website and have supplied your email address, AFTERSHIP may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with AFTERSHIP and our products. We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you are a registered member of a AFTERSHIP website and do not wish to receive such emails, please follow the instructions included in each email sent. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
</p>
<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>
<p>If you decide to visit the AFTERSHIP website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>AFTERSHIP may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in AFTERSHIP's sole discretion. AFTERSHIP encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If changes are made, notice will be given in the AFTERSHIP blog at awesome-ship.com/journal. Your continued use of our sites and services after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
