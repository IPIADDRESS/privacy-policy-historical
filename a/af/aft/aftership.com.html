<h3 id="2--types-of-cookies-27789">2. Types of Cookies</h3>

<ul>
<li>Session cookies: these are temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session; that is, when you leave the site. Session cookies allow this Website to recognise you as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use this Website most efficiently.

<li>Persistent cookies: in contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are stored on your equipment between browsing sessions until expiry or deletion. They therefore enable this Website to "recognise" you on your return remember your preferences and tailor services to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to session cookies and persistent cookies, there may be other cookies which are set by this Website which you have chosen to visit, such as this Website, in order to provide us or third parties with information.</p>
<h3 id="3--our-use-of-cookies-27790">3. Our use of Cookies</h3>

<li>help us recognise you as a unique user when you return to our Website so that you do not have to input your details multiple times as you move between our pages or services</li>
<li>remember how you have customised your use of this Website, such as your preferred currency and time zone</li>
<li>collect and compile anonymous, aggregated information for statistical and evaluation purposes to help us understand how users use this Website and help us improve the structure of our Website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many cookies are designed to give you optimal usage of the web. For example, we use cookies to enable you to improve your user experience when using our Website, e.g. a cookie which recognises if your browser supports specific technology features. This helps, for example, in enabling web pages to be loaded more quickly when you request the download of a large file.</p>
<p>In addition to cookies which send information to us, we also use cookies which collect information and send it to third parties. An example of this is Google Analytics. Please check the relevant third party website for more information about their use of cookies. Where this Website allows such cookies to be set or you access other websites from this Website using the links provided, the operators of these websites will use cookies in accordance with their own cookies policy, which may differ from ours.</p>
