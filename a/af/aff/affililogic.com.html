            Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
            The integrity of individuals is an important factor of Affililogic’s business success.

        </p>
        <p>

            Introduction
        </p>
        <p>
            Affililogic processes digital information about Users (web surfers) who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Affililogic has contracted to serve advertisements (the “Advertising Network”). This part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy contains instructions on how you can display and delete information collected by Affililogic yourself and how you can opt-out from further Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Affililogic. Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to notify Users about Affililogic’s services on their websites.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 700">
            What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?
        </p>
        <p>
            There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more relevant to web surfers’ likely interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Affililogic’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services are cookie based. “Cookies” are small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard drive of a web surfer’s computer. Based on the anonymous information stored in the User’s cookie, Affililogic is able provide more relevant advertising to the User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits sports sites often will be categorized in the “sports fan” segment, and will primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific offers for such car model or computer model.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Affililogic’s processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow Affililogic to trace the User; we do not have, and will not initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to trace the identities of Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information collected at the User’s visits to websites belonging to Affililogic’s Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User’s cookie can only be viewed by Affililogic when the User visits a website that belongs to our Advertising Network.

            Information stored on cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            please list a complete breakdown of which information is stored in the cookies and what it does
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to information which Affililogic considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual life. Further, Affililogic is very sensitive to the issue of children’s privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are intended to be established for the profiling of children.

        <p style="font-weight: 700">
            Use of collected digital data
        </p>
        <p>
            Affililogic will use the User data in order to better target advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous information collected from other sources so that we may better serve Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share anonymous data between companies within the Affililogic group of companies.
