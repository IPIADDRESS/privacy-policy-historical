    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
    firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal
    information provided by those visiting and interacting with
    this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal
    information in the highest regard. The following discloses
    our information gathering and dissemination practices for
    this website.</p>

    <p>We
    recognize the importance of protecting your privacy and our
    policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we
    collect, use and safeguard the personal information you
    provide to us and to assist you in making informed
    decisions when using our site. This policy will be
    continuously assessed against new technologies, business
    practices and our customers' needs.</p>

    <p><strong>What
    Information Do We
    Collect?</strong></p>

    <p>When
    you visit this web site you may provide us with two types
    of information: personal information you knowingly choose
    to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and
    Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as
    you and others browse our Web site.</p>

    <p><strong>1.
    Personal Information You Choose to
    Provide:</strong></p>

    <p><u>Registration
    Information</u><br>When
    you register for any of our products, services or
    newsletters you will provide us information about
    yourself.</p>

    <p>
    Email Information<br>

    If you
    choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain
    the content of your email messages together with your email
    address and our responses. We provide the same protections
    for these electronic communications that we employ in the
    maintenance of information received by mail and
    telephone.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong></p>

    <p>Similar
    to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a
    standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation
    below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to
    collect information about how our Web site is used.
    Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs
    may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed,
    time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just
    before and just after our Web site.</p>

    <p><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to
    Us?</strong></p>

    <p>Broadly
    speaking, we use personal information for purposes of
    administering our business activities, providing the
    products and services you requested, to process your
    payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing
    and promotional efforts and improve our content and service
    offerings, and customize our site's content, layout,
    services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve
    our site and better tailor it to meet your
    needs.</p>

    <p>Furthermore,
    such information may be shared with others on an aggregate
    basis. Personally identifiable information or business
    information will not be shared with parties except as
    required by law.</p>

    <p>Occasionally,
    we may also use the information we collect to notify you
    about important changes to our Website, new services, and
    special offers we think you will find valuable. You may
    notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these
    offers by emailing us at the link provided on the
    newsletter.</p>

    <p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></p>

    <p>A
    cookie is a very small text document, which often includes
    an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site,
    that site's computer asks your computer for permission to
    store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically
    designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own
    cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow
    it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits
    a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to
    you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers
    are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would
    prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the
    configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you
    choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible
    that some areas of our site will not function as
    effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot
    retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on
    computer viruses.</p>

    <p><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from
    Cookies?</strong></p>

    <p>As you
    visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
    differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also
    use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than
    is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our
    Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate
    number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of
    the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to
    constantly improve our Web site and better serve our
    clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal
    information about you and we do not intentionally store any
    personal information that your browser provided to us in
    your cookies.</p>

    <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>

    <p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are
    connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that
    is used by computers on the network to identify your
    computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our
    web server as part of demographic and profile data known as
    traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you
    request) can be sent to you.</p>

    <p><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong></p>

    <p>We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that
    uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or
    personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is
    necessary to process transactions or provide services that
    you have requested.</p>

    <p><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong></p>

    <p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable
    information that we collect online and maintain in our
    database by emailing us at the usual address.</p>

    <p><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong></p>

    <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in
    other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law
    requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We
    may also disclose account information when we have reason
    to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
    identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
    may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the
    safety of our users and the Public.</p>

    <p><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web
    Site?</strong></p>

    <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites
    linked to or from our Web site or the information or
    content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites
    are provided solely as pointers to information on topics
    that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>

    <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to
    another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in
    effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web
    site, including web sites, which have a link on our
    Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and
    policies. Please read over those rules and policies before
    proceeding.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

    <p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of
    your personal information as described in this Privacy
    Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy
    at any time with or without notice.</p>

    <p><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></p>

    <p>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on
    our computers in the United States. The laws on holding
    personal data in the United States may be less stringent
    than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship.
    To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and
    ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place
    appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
    to safeguard and secure the information we collect
    online.</p>

    <p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</strong></p>

    <p>This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not
    receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will
    discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as
    technically feasible.</p>

    <p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>

    <p>From
    time-to-time our site requests information from users via
    surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or
    contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has
    a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
    Information requested may include contact information (such
    as name and shipping address), and demographic information
    (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be
    used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey
    information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
    improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

    <p><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></p>

    <p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we
    ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any
    personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use
    this service only in conjunction with permission and
    guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>

    <p><strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></p>

    <p>In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its
    assets) is acquired, your information would be considered
    part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that
    are transferred.</p>

    <p><strong>Policy Modifications</strong></p>

    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when
    changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email
    users who have given us permission to do so. We will post
    any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.
    However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy
    changes in the future, we will not use the personal
    information you have submitted to us under this Privacy
    Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with
    this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent</p>
