        <ul class="c-list  u-mb-24">
          <li>
            <span class="u-wf-600  u-text-cod-grey">Consent</span><br>
            <p>In some cases, we will process your Personal Data based on obtaining your express consent for us to do so, for example when signing up to receive our newsletter. Where this applies, we will always offer you the opportunity to withdraw your consent for this processing at any time.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="u-wf-600  u-text-cod-grey">Contract</span><br>
            <p>It may be necessary for us to capture and store your Personal Data to fulfil our contractual obligation to you. For example, we may need to retain a copy of your email address where it forms part of the product license you purchase from us.</p>

          <li>
            <span class="u-wf-600  u-text-cod-grey">Legitimate Interests</span><br>
            <p>Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation there is a concept of "legitimate interests" as a justification for processing your Personal Data, where we have good and fair reasons to do so in ways which do not adversely affect your interests and rights.</p>

            <p>Our legitimate interests for processing your Personal Data are:</p>

              <ul class="c-list  u-mb-24">
