This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.</p>    <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong>  We will collect personal information from you when you register for any CinemaDen membership, interact with our CinemaDen Applications update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our CinemaDen Applications.

This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit/debit cards.</p>    <p><strong>Surveys and Promotions.</strong> From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys.  Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.</p>    <h4>Information Collected Through Technology</h4>    <p>In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the CinemaDen Applications ("Usage Information").  This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the CinemaDen Applications, all of the areas within the CinemaDen Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use the this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the CinemaDen Applications.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer or other device used to access the CinemaDen Applications (any, a "Device").  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the CinemaDen Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information. <br>A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:</p>    <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Site.  Cookies are stored on users' hard drives.  We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies."  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user's hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as  local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Site may not function properly.</p>    <p><strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>    <p><strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the CinemaDen Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>    <p><strong>HTML5.</strong> We use HTML5 in the CinemaDen Applications and mobile website for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser "cookies" file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>    <p><strong>Web Logs.</strong> Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the CinemaDen Applications.  We may track your movement within the CinemaDen Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.  This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our CinemaDen Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our CinemaDen Applications and usage and browsing habits.  We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our CinemaDen Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.  We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.</p>    <h4>Information You Provide About a Third Party</h4>    <p>If you send someone else a communication from the CinemaDen Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our publications, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the CinemaDen Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>    <h4>Information We Collect From Third Parties</h4>    <p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>    <h4>Third Party Analytics Technologies</h4>    <p>We use third parties' analytic tools, provided by Google Analytics, to better understand who is using the Site, how people are using the Site and how to improve the effectiveness of the Site and its content. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Site, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other web sites you may have visited. We do not have access to, nor control over, Google's use of cookies or other tracking technologies. If you would like more information regarding Google's use of cookies or other tracking tools on our Site or want to know more about your choices about not having this anonymous collected or used, please click here. <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/"> https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a></p>    <h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>    <p>We also use third-party ad servers and ad networks to serve advertisements when you visit the CinemaDen Applications.  These companies and the advertisers themselves may use information about your visits on other web sites and CinemaDen Applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements to CinemaDen Applications, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the CinemaDen Applications.  They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens.  They may also use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers, ad servers or ad networks.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on our CinemaDen Applications to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.  In addition, some of the ad servers and ad networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.  If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on our CinemaDen Applications from ad servers and ad networks, you will continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of our CinemaDen Applications and/or third party web sites.  If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies, you can go to www.networkadvertising.org .  If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner you can go to www.aboutads.info .</p>    <p>Our Ads on Third Party Sites.  We may use information collected using third party cookies and Web beacons on CinemaDen Applications and in our emails to deliver advertising about our Services displayed to you on third party websites.  We also may use cookies to collect information to know when you return to our CinemaDen Applications after visiting those third party websites.  We use this information and other information about you, to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about our Services which you might be interested in.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, ad servers or ad networks we use to display our ads on other websites.  Some of the ad servers and ad networks we use to display our ads may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.  If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies you can go to www.networkadvertising.org .  If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected to serve advertising on the internet you can go to www.aboutads.info .</p>    <h4>II.  HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>    <p><strong>Use of Information by Us.</strong> We may use Information that we collect about you: </p>    <ul>    <li>(1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; </li>    <li>(2) to provide you with information regarding new features, products or services;</li>    <li>(3) to improve the CinemaDen Applications or our Services and to customize your experience; </li>    <li>(4) to contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site and/or the Site's policies;</li>    <li>(5) for internal business purposes;</li>    <li>(6) to share with our marketing partners; and</li>    <li>(7) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Transactional Communications.</strong> We may send you notices from time to time relating to your account or your subscriptions.  These may include order confirmations, renewal notices, invoices or customer service notifications.
