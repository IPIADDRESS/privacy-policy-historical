        <div class="PrivacyPolicyMainContent">
          <p>Affiliate Media, Inc.  ("Affiliate Media") is dedicated to establishing trusting  relationships with its users, based on respect for personal information, by  promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy policy covers all  Web properties owned and maintained by Affiliate Media, including but not  limited to <a href="http://www.affiliateprograms.com/">www.affiliateprograms.com</a>&nbsp;(collectively, the "Websites"). This  privacy policy (the "Policy") is designed to inform you about the  types of information that we gather about you, how we may use that information,  whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of  that information. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check  back periodically.</p>
          <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                    <p>The Websites collects  personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information refers  to information that specifically identifies who you are. We request personally  identifiable information when you register with us or correspond with us. This  information might include your name, mailing address, telephone number or  e-mail address.</p>
                    <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>We will share your  personally identifiable information with third parties. Users will occasionally  receive emails containing information about us, or information about third party  services or affiliate programs that are likely to be of interest to our users.  Users may opt-out of receiving such emails. Affiliate Media is not responsible  for the privacy practices of those third parties (or their designees) from  which you may receive emails. Their privacy policies may differ from our  Policy.</p>
                      <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>From time to time, we  may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide  personally identifiable information to appropriate governmental authorities. We  will disclose personally identifiable information upon receipt of a court order  or subpoena or in order to assist a law enforcement investigation. We fully  cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our  Websites' services for illegal activities.</p>
                      <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>The ads appearing on  our Websites are delivered to users through various third party advertising  partners. Information about users' visits to our Websites, such as number of  times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal  information), is used to serve ads to users on the Websites. Third party  advertising partners do not have access to personally identifiable information.</p>
                      <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>In the event Affiliate  Media goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by  another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personally  identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets  transferred. Users may be notified prior to a change of ownership or control of  their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the  users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different  from that stated at the time of collection, users may object to such use by  sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@affiliateprograms.com">privacy-@-affiliatemedia.com</a> (without dashes).</p>
                      <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>The Websites contain  links to other sites. Please be aware that Affiliate Media is not responsible  for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be  aware when they leave our sites and to read the privacy statements of each and  every website that collects personally identifiable information. The Policy  applies solely to information collected by the Websites.</p>
                      <div class="divH15">&nbsp;</div>
                      <p>The Policy was last  changed on March 31, 2007. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the  Policy, the changes will be posted in this document so that you will always  know what information we gather as well as how we might use that information  and to whom we may disclose it. We may change, modify, add or remove portions  of the Policy at any time. Please be sure to check this page before proceeding  to use the Websites.
