Whether you email support to open a support ticket, start a live chat session, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Payment Information:</strong> We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services.

The use of cookies is necessary for the provision of the Services, for example for tracking sessions for ensuring secure access. We also use cookies for performance and analytics, for example through the use of Google Analytics and Heap Analytics to enable us to improve the Services we operate. We also use cookies for Targeting, Advertising and Social Media to make advertising and communication relevant to you and your interests. To opt-out of our cookies, you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit.

For example, you may be mentioned in an Activity created by someone else or a Task opened by someone else. We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services. Similarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they create an account in the Services.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Other services you link to your account:</strong> We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate or link a third-party service with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. You or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For example, you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services. You may authorize our Services to sync a contact list or address book so that you can easily connect with those contacts within the Services or invite them to collaborate with you on our Services. The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Accelo Partners:</strong> We work with a <a href="/partners/find-a-certified-partner/">global network of partners</a> who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products. Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our products, generate leads for us, and resell our products. We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Services you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Other Partners:</strong> We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.<a name="use"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">How we use information we collect</h2><p dir="ltr">How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</strong> We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team. For example, we may use your stated role and activity to return search results we think are relevant to you. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. We combine information about you and your activities across the Services to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For research, performance, analytics and development:</strong> We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you. We use observations and data about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services. For example, to improve new user experiences we use browser replay technology and event analytics to identify bottlenecks or points of confusion for new users. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. In addition, we use data about how you and people use our Services for purposes of monitoring performance or functionality or for any other benchmarking or internal business purposes. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To communicate with you about the Services:</strong> We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including help information and guides sent during a trial or new user onboarding process, reminding you of subscription expirations, alerting the billing contact of increases in user counts prior to invoicing, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are assigned a Task or included as a recipient of an Activity. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier. We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account preferences inside the Service.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services:</strong> We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Accelo ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under <a href="/company/privacy-policy/#optout">Opt-out of communications</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Customer support:</strong> We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For safety and security:</strong> We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights:</strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With your consent:</strong> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):</h3><p dir="ltr">If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p><ul><li>
<p dir="ltr">We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</p>

<li>
<p dir="ltr">You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr">If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.<a name="share"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">How we share information we collect</h2><p dir="ltr">We make productivity tools, and we want them to work well for you. This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sharing with other Service users</h3><p dir="ltr">When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For collaboration:</strong> You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select. Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content. For example, when you create an Activity or Task, we display your profile picture, name and email address as the "Owner" or "Sender" so that other users with access to the Activity or Task understand who created it.<a name="managed"></a></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Managed accounts and administrators:</strong> If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain. If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Online Forums:</strong> Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, ideas and community forums and video content. You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sharing with third parties</h3><p dir="ltr">We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us and subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Accelo Partners:</strong> We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.&nbsp;We share such information subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Third Party Apps:</strong> You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services. Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. If you are a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Links to Third Party Sites:</strong> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Social Media Widgets:</strong> The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your use of and any information you submit to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Third-Party Widgets:</strong> Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Google address finder. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With your consent:</strong> We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights:</strong> In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Accelo, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sharing with affiliated companies</h3><p dir="ltr">We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.<a name="store"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">How we store and secure information we collect</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Information storage and security</h3><p dir="ltr">We use data hosting service providers in the United States, Australia and Ireland to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.</p><p dir="ltr">While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How long we keep information</h3><p dir="ltr">How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Account information:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active for a reasonable amount of time thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Information you share on the Services:</strong> If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Managed accounts:</strong> If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account. For more information, see <a href="/company/privacy-policy/#managed">Managed accounts and administrators</a> above.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Marketing information:</strong> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Accelo account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.<a name="access"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">How to access and control your information</h2><p dir="ltr">You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Your Choices:</h3><p dir="ltr">You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy/#endusers">Notice to End Users</a> below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.</p><p dir="ltr">Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Access and update your information:</strong> Our Services and <a href="/resources/help/">related documentation</a> give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using keyword searches in the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Deactivate your account:</strong> If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account. If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact Accelo support via <a href="mailto:support@accelo.com">support@accelo.com</a>. Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Delete your information:</strong> Our Services and <a href="/resources/help/">related documentation</a> give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content if the administrator has allowed your account to have the relevant deletion permissions, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request that we stop using your information:</strong> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.<a name="optout"></a></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Opt out of communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account preferences.</p><p dir="ltr">You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Turning off cookies will result in a degraded Service experience (including the inability to use the Service).</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Send "Do Not Track" Signals:</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Data portability:</strong> Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Administrators have the right to export the SQL data from the Service - this standardized format ensures high portability, but is also monolithic and available only for the entire organization using the Service.<a name="internationally"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">How we transfer information we collect internationally</h2><h3 dir="ltr">International transfers of information we collect</h3><p dir="ltr">We collect information globally and primarily store that information in the United States, Australia and Ireland. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>International transfers within the Accelo Companies:</strong> To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information to either Ireland or the United States and allow access to that information from countries in which the Accelo owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy. These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based. When we share information about you within and among Accelo corporate affiliates, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>International transfers to third parties:</strong> Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share information of customers in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.<a name="other"></a></p><h2 dir="ltr">Other important privacy information&nbsp;<a name="endusers"></a></h2><h3 dir="ltr">Notice to End Users</h3><p dir="ltr">Many of our products are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">Administrators are able to:</p><ul><li>
