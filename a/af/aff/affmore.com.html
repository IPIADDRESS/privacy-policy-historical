This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p>
<p><em>With Your Consent</em><br>We may share information with your consent. But we never sell or otherwise transfer any personal information to third parties without a valid reason, namely reporting to legal authorities or law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><em>Affiliates and marketing partners</em><br>We're using affiliates and marketing partners who may advertise our services to you. We are not sharing any personal information with these partners and we do not take any responsibility for the services they are providing.</p>
<h2 id="legal-basis-for-processing-personal-information">LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.<br>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.<br>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.<br>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<h2 id="third-party-services">THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
<p>You may access other third-party services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those third-party services from within the Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third-party services, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies.</p>
<h2 id="security">SECURITY</h2>
<p>Lucky Dino Gaming Limited is committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information from unauthorised access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<h2 id="data-retention">DATA RETENTION</h2>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).<br>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<h2 id="access">ACCESS</h2>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may access certain information associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing <a href="mailto:support@luckydino.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">support@luckydino.com</a>. If you terminate your Account, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers.<br>To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily limited where access and correction could: inhibit Lucky Dino Gaming Limited's ability to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit Lucky Dino Gaming Limited's ability to investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business information belonging to Lucky Dino Gaming Limited or a third party.</p>

For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.<br>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
