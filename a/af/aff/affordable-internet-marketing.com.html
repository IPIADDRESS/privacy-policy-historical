<li>On our website<br>
We are strongly committed to safeguarding subscribers' privacy on anownsite.com.<br>

To be honest, although we love every one of our visitors dearly, we don't have any interest in what you, as an individual, are doing at the site!<br>
But we are more interested in what you as a herd are doing. We want to know how you got here, what pages you tend to visit, and what pages you don't tend to visit.<br>
<br>

Every request to any site results in some data send from the requestor to that site. Servers automatically detect such information <strong>IF available</strong>.<br>
We use a script to view such information that is made available on our servers.<br>
For each visitor to our site, our server automatically recognizes statistics about where you came from, the pages followed, what kind of browser you use and the IP-address you have and the domain name.<br>
<br>

The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our site and to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual browser.  After doing so, the information is then discarded.<br>
