    </p>
<p><strong>4.  HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA </strong>
    </p>
<p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most   commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:              &nbsp; <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><u>Consent</u>             </p>
<p>Where you have given us consent to the processing. Typically, this   will include where you have consented to the installation of Cookies for   the collection and sharing of other Technical Data and/or Behavioural   Data. However, this may also include where you sign up to receive   marketing offers from us or our partners. You have the right to withdraw   consent to marketing at any time by contacting us or opting-out. For   more information, see the section on Your Legal Rights.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><u>Legitimate Interests</u>             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a   third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override   those interests. Typically, this will include where we contact you in   the course of our business activities, or in relation to marketing where   you have bought a product or service from us.             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>We may also rely on our legitimate interests for the use of <strong>Inferred Data</strong> for targeted advertising purposes, where this does not include <strong>Special Category</strong> data.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><u>Legal Obligation</u>             </p>
<p>We may also stored your personal data where we need to comply with a   legal obligation, including to pass information to government and   supervisory authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;              </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><u>Performance of a Contract</u>             </p>
<p>We may also stored your personal data where we need it to process a   contract with you, for example, for the provision of goods and services   you have requested.             &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA&nbsp; </strong>             &nbsp;             </p>
<p><u>Profiling</u>             </p>
<p>Affectv may use data we receive in the form of <strong>Behavioural Data</strong>   from the sources listed above in order to create a profile of specific   users’ interests and behavioural information, and allow us to target   them with useful advertising later on. We may also compile <strong>Inferred Data</strong>   into “segmented profiles” or “model audiences” based around categories   of interests, which can later be associated with different users.              </p>
<p>This is performed using an automated technological process and is   passed on to our third-party partners to ensure that this information is   used to target appropriate advertisements to you. However, we do not   use any <strong>Special Category Personal Data </strong>to generate such profiles.             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the   ways we use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on   to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are,   where appropriate.             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful   ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your   data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal   ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than   one ground has been set out in the table below.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p><strong>THIRD-PARTY MARKETING&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>We will make sure to collect opt-in consent before we share your   personal data with any third party for marketing purposes. This will be   achieved through the use of opt-in click or button functionalities   through our website or requiring you to perform another affirmative   action, such as replying to an email or text, to confirm your consent.              </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>CHANGE OF PURPOSE&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we   collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for   another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.              </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA&nbsp; </strong>             </p>

<p><strong>THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS</strong>             </p>
<p>With any website that you visit that has Affectv cookies, the   publisher of that website will potentially be a joint data controller of   the data collected through such cookies. In particular, several of our   clients may use Affectv’s cookies, in order to allow us to personalise   the advertisements that you receive.             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>Data content providers and aggregators, such as Permutive and   ShareThis, as joint data controllers with Affectv, may install cookies   on a variety of publishers’ websites, which collect your personal data. Permutive and ShareThis may then provide this data in a live data feed to   Affectv. Permutive and ShareThis act as joint data controllers of this   data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>Another of our third-party partners, AppNexus also may receive your personal data from Affectv, which consists of <strong>Behavioural Data </strong>(including potentially <strong>Inferred Data)</strong> and personal data such as <strong>Technical Data</strong> and <strong>Identity Data</strong>   associated with it. AppNexus then usess such data in order to organise   targeted advertising to you on various websites that you may visit.   AppNexus acts as a data processor of this data, on behalf of   Affectv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>Ad verification partner Adloox acts as a processor of personal data on behalf of Affectv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>Data may be shared with our trusted third-party partners, which may   result in data being transferred out of the European Economic Area   (EEA).             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>Our third party partners include AppNexus, which may process data   identifiable to you for ensuring that you only receive relevant   advertisements on servers operated in the USA. AppNexus have certified   under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification and have agreed   EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with us, which allows us to   legally transfer your personal data to them.             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>We may also use cloud providers such as Salesforce that use servers   based in the United States of America, with the safeguards of the   EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification, which allows us to legally   transfer your personal data to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;             &nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; DATA SECURITY&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your   personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an   unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Moreover, we ensure that any   Identity Data that we process will be internally pseudonymised – i.e.   cookie IDs converted to an Affectv ID, where possible.             </p>
<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those   employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a   business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our   instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.              &nbsp;             </p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal   data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach   where we are legally required to do so.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; DATA RETENTION&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?&nbsp;             </p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably   necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the   purposes of providing you any services, carrying out targeted   advertising, and satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or   reporting requirements.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>
<p>With regard to the use of personal data collected from Cookies, the   retention period is set by the original website that placed such a   Cookie, rather than Affectv.</p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp; YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under the GDPR in   relation to your personal data, upon request. In most cases, the website   publisher or third-party partners that originally collected the   information from you, such as through a Cookie, will be better placed to   help you comply with such rights.             &nbsp;             </p>
<ul><li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a   “subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the   personal data we or our third-party partners hold about you and to check   that we are lawfully processing it.    
</li><li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold   about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we   hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of   the new data you provide to us.    
</li><li>Request erasure of your personal data. You also have   the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you   have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see   below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where   we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.     
</li><li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are   relying on a legitimate interest, in addition to objection to the   creation of profiles about you. You also have the right to object where   we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. You   should exercise this by contacting us at privacy@affectv.com or   replying to the marketing email you received with [OPT OUT]
</li><li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or   to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have   chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,   machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to data that   you or our third-party partners have provided to us and does not apply   to <strong>Inferred Data </strong>used to create profiles<strong>.</strong>    
&nbsp;             &nbsp;             </li></ul><p><strong>OPTING OUT&nbsp; </strong>             &nbsp;             </p>

<p>You also have the right to opt-out to any Identity Data or   Behavioural Data collected through cookies that Affectv or our Third   Party Partners may carry out, as well as to your tracking through such   cookies. On opting out, arrangements will also be made so that the user   is no longer tracked by Affectv and that data is no longer received   from Permutive and ShareThis in relation to the user.<span></span>             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing   messages at any time by accessing our website and selecting your   preference (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://affectv.com/opt-out">https://affectv.com/opt-out</a></span>).&nbsp;             </p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will   not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of [a   product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service   experience or other transactions].             &nbsp;             </p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>COOKIES&nbsp; </strong>             &nbsp;             </p>
<p>You can also opt-out of all Affectv cookies, including targeting that   we and third-party partners we pass this information to (such as   AppNexus).           </p>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to   alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or  refuse  cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become   inaccessible or not function properly.

<p><strong>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>In order to allow you to exercise these rights, we must be in a position to be able to identify any personal data, including <strong>Identity,</strong> <strong>Behavioural </strong>and potentially <strong>Inferred Data </strong>that   relates to you, for which we may require you to provide us with   specific identifiers, such as CookieIDs.

<p><strong>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND&nbsp; </strong>             </p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.   Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is   particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this   case, we will notify you and keep you updated.             </p>
<p>&nbsp;             </p>

<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to   exercise any of the other rights).

Cookies are essential to the effective operation of our   website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster   and easier. Cookies may also be set by the website you are visiting   (first party cookies) or they may be set by other websites who run   content on the page you are viewing (third party cookies).             </p>

<p>Opting out of Affectv cookies does not mean you will no longer   receive online advertising. It does mean that Affectv will no longer   deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. The   Affectv Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the tool to work on   your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies. Be advised   that if you change computers or upgrade or change browsers, clear or   delete this opt out cookie either separately or by clearing all cookies   of your browser or if you use multiple computers or browsers, you will   need to repeat this opt-out process for each computer and each browser.              </p>
