&amp; EMAIL POLICY</b></div>
            <p>Your
privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the
Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use
the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with
complete confidence.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
We have created
this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and
security. This Privacy Policy describes how "Advanced Marketing Wealth
Solutions Incorporated" herein known as the "Company" collects
information from all end users of our Internet services (the
"Services")-those who access some of our Services but do not have
accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or
pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what
we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and
Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We
request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <b> Personal
Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</b><br>
            <br>
Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from
Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and
the network of Web sites accessible through our Service.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
Registration:&nbsp; Members may be asked to provide certain
personal
information when they sign up for our Products or Services including
name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit
card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access
the Services. The personal information collected from Members during
the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such
as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third
parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;However,
in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our
Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such
as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the
Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering
you other products and services. </p>
            <p>In this instance,
personal information may not be used by the partner
for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and
aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during
registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members).
As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and
non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the
Services.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Also, with
purchases, we supply
our member's contact information, to our business partners, who then
may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales
proceeds are collected by the that business partner company.&nbsp;
We also
may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we
believe would be of interest to our members, with or without
compensation from those companies.&nbsp; At times we may send an
advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales
proceeds, and forward the purchaser's information to that third party. </p>
            <p> Our
Company Partners and Sponsors:&nbsp; Some products and services may
be
offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate,
independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide
Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner
may need to collect and maintain personal information.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Online
Shopping:&nbsp; At some Web sites, you can purchase products and
services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter,
catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be
asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email
address, phone number, and credit/debit card information.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>If you complete an
order for someone else, such as an online gift order
sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information
about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone
number. Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any
personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please
exercise care when doing so.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the
personal information you provide to process that order.&nbsp; We do
share this information with outside parties that we do business with. </p>
            <p>Online
Advertisements:&nbsp; Our company may display our online
advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors
and Members collected through the registration process as well as
through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Additionally, in
some instances, we use this information to deliver
tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser
or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and
provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the
information we have collected, we may then display or send the
advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal
information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers or
joint venture companies.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Email Policies:</p>
            <p>Responses to Email Inquiries: When Visitors or Members

Q. Who will have access to your email information?<br>
            <br>

            <br>
We have stringent protocols put in place to protect user data and only

            <p>Voluntary Customer Surveys:&nbsp; We may periodically
conduct both
business
and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to
participate in these surveys because they provide us with important
information that helps us to improve the types of products and services
we offer and how we provide them to you.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may take the
information we receive from individuals responding to
our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses
of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to
the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies,
education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the
quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and
products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may
be shared with third parties.</p>
            <p>Promotions:&nbsp;
Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings, games,
content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or cobranded with
third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other
promotion, simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with
personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose.
Due to these third party relationships, the third parties may obtain
personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
our company. Our company has no control over third parties' use of this
information.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
Additionally, personally
identifiable information may be collected when you order products,
enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion,
subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or
participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of
personally identifiable information that may be collected at these
pages include but may not be limited to: name, address, e-mail address,
telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information

services. Our sponsors or third parties may send you material that
relates to our company's services, products or activities.<br>
            <br>
Special Cases:&nbsp; It is our company's policy to use or share the
personal information about Visitors or Members in ways described herein
without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit
such unrelated uses.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Also, we may
disclose personal information about Visitors or Members,
or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites
accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole
discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including:
credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law
enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental
or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is
necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone
who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or
other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect
our company and our Members.&nbsp; </p>
