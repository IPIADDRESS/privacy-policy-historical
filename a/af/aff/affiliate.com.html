<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
    <strong>MEDIA BREAKAWAY, LLC, and each of its related web sites (“Media  Breakaway”) Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  Last updated September 26, 2007.<br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy outlines important information regarding the use  and disclosure of information collected via this Website.&nbsp; Media  Breakaway provides this Privacy Policy to help users make an informed  decision as to whether to use or continue using the Website.<br>
  <br>
  PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES  ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS  IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. MEDIA BREAKAWAY  DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING  THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF  THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO MEDIA  BREAKAWAY OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON  ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy applies to Media Breakaway’s collection, use,  storage and disclosure of information by Media Breakaway on its (a)  websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related  companies (collectively, the “Website”), (b) on various third party  websites, and (c) to Media Breakaway’s other information collection,  including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Media  Breakaway is not responsible for the information collection or privacy  practices of third web sites or applications.<br>
  By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject  to the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal  information you provide via the Website or through other official Media  Breakaway contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as  the Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>1.1 Survey Information.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway collects information from individuals by various  methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily  completes an Media Breakaway survey, order form, or a registration page  either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys,  order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties  (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the  Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and  “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in  the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar  means.) In the Surveys, Media Breakaway or a third party (a “Third  Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to Media  Breakaway, which may include his or her name, email address, street  address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and  carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and content of the  SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital  status, occupation, social security number, employment information,  personal and online interests, and such other information as may be  requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). Media  Breakaway may also collect information concerning an individual from  another source and use that information in combination with information  provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely  voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey  Information to Media Breakaway or Third Party, but an individual may  receive incentives from Media Breakaway or a Third Party in exchange  for providing Survey Information to Media Breakaway.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.2 Third Party List Information.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway collects information from individuals when an  individual provides information to a Third Party and Media Breakaway  subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information  from the Third Party (the “Seller”). Such purchased information may  include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address,  street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone  numbers and carriers), SMS messaging details (e.g. date, time and  content of the SMS message), birth date, gender, salary range,  education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment,  personal and online interests, and such other information as the  individual may have provided to the Seller (together, “Third Party List  Information”). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Media  Breakaway seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right  to transfer the Third Party List Information to Media Breakaway and  that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the  individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.3 Other Information.</strong><br>
  Other occasions when Media Breakaway obtains information from  individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a  prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Media Breakaway or  by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through  Media Breakaway’s customer service department, and (3) when an  individual voluntarily subscribes to a Media Breakaway service or  newsletter (together, “Other Information”).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to  associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with  information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Media  Breakaway may use other new and evolving sources of information in the  future (together, “Technology Information”).<br>
  <strong>(a) Cookies.&nbsp; </strong>A cookie is a small amount of data  stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Media  Breakaway to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data  that resides in Media Breakaway’s database. You may read more about  cookies at <a href="http://www.mediabreakaway.com/www./cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">http://cookiecentral.com</a>. Individuals who use the Website need to accept  cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.<br>
  <strong>(b) Web Beacons.&nbsp; </strong>A web beacon is programming code  that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img  src=“x”&gt; programming function -- see http://truste.org for more  information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique  user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and  associate the individual with previously acquired information about an  individual in a database. This allows Media Breakaway to track certain  web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to  determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and  to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example,  Media Breakaway might place, with the consent of a Third Party website,  a web beacon on the Third Party's website where baseball products are  sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Media Breakaway’s database,  visits the fishing website, Media Breakaway receives notice by means of  the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and Media Breakaway  would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is  interested in baseball. Media Breakaway may thereafter present offers  of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using  web beacons on web pages, Media Breakaway also uses web beacons in  email messages sent to individuals listed in Media Breakaway’s database.<br>
  <strong>(c) New Technology.&nbsp; </strong>The use of technology on the  Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is  Media Breakaway’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result,  Media Breakaway strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy  for any updates regarding its use of technology.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.5 Outside Information.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway may receive information about individuals from Third  Parties or from other sources of information outside of Media Breakaway  including information located in public databases (“Outside  Information”).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.6 Individual Information.</strong><br>
  As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third  Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and  Outside Information, and any other information Media Breakaway gathers  or receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and  viewing data.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway will never knowingly collect any personal information  about children under the age of 13. If Media Breakaway obtains actual  knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child  under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from  our database. Because it does not collect such information, Media  Breakaway has no such information to use or to disclose to Third  Parties. Media Breakaway has designed this policy in order to comply  with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.8 Credit Card Information.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and  related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit  Card Information”) when an individual places an order from Media  Breakaway. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Media  Breakaway, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL  encryption software. Media Breakaway will use the Credit Card  Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase  transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to Third  Parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
  Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers  will automatically record and archive certain information that  web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may  include information vital to validating the user’s authorization to  access the account. Information, such as a Web request, Internet  Protocol (the “IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring  pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages  viewed and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request,  and other important data is necessary to validate and authorize a  user’s entry and activity on the Website.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Use of Individual Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</strong><br>
  THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE  IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
  The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how Media Breakaway  currently uses Individual Information, but Media Breakaway may change  or broaden its use at any time. As noted, Media Breakaway may update  this policy from time to time. Media Breakaway may use Individual  Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of  email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online  banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.2 Email.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway uses Individual Information to provide promotional  offers by email to individuals. Media Breakaway may maintain separate  email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end  their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow  the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from  the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Media Breakaway’s email  lists, a person must send an email to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@mediabreakaway.com">unsubscribe@mediabreakaway.com</a>.<br>
  <strong>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</strong><br>
  In certain commercial email messages sent by Media Breakaway, an  advertiser's name will appear in the “From:” line but hitting the  “Reply” button will cause a reply email to be sent to Media Breakaway.  The “Subject:” line of Media Breakaway email messages will usually  contain a line provided from the advertiser to Media Breakaway.<br>
  <strong>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the  Website to receive email from Media Breakaway or to individuals who  have agreed on Third Party websites to receive email from Third Parties  such as Media Breakaway. Media Breakaway does not send unsolicited  email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for  unsolicited email are not applicable to Media Breakaway’s email  messages.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway uses Individual Information to target advertising to an  individual. When an individual is using the Internet, Media Breakaway  uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate  an individual with that person's Individual Information, and Media  Breakaway attempts to show advertising for products and services in  which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an  interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. Media  Breakaway may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email,  direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication  to provide promotional offers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or  indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing  using telephones and cell phones.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>2.5&nbsp;  Mobile Phone SMS Messaging.</strong><br>
  In certain cases, when requested by an individual, a Third Party may  use Individual Information to provide customized content and  advertising via SMS messaging to an individual’s cell phone.&nbsp; Media  Breakaway is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content  of such Third Parties.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.6 Use of Technology Information.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's  Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories  of Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals,  (2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to  determine which areas of Media Breakaway’s web sites are most  frequently visited. This information helps Media Breakaway to better  understand the online habits of individuals so that Media Breakaway can  target advertising and promotions to them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.7 Profiles of Individuals.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway uses Individual Information to make a profile of an  individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information  and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual  Information such as information obtained from public databases.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.8 Storage of Individual Information</strong>.<br>
  Media Breakaway stores the Individual Information in a database on  Media Breakaway computers. Our computers have security measures (such  as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and  alteration of the information under Media Breakaway’s control. Not  withstanding such measures, Media Breakaway cannot guarantee that its  security measures will prevent Media Breakaway computers from being  illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or  altered.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>3.1 Sale  or Transfer to Third Parties.</strong><br>
  Media Breakaway MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD  PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN MEDIA BREAKAWAY’S SOLE  DISCRETION.<br>

  Media Breakaway may disclose Individual Information to respond to  subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong>3.5 Access.</strong><br>
  Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to  provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete  such information. Access can be obtained by contacting <a href="mailto:contact@mediabreakaway.com">contact@mediabreakaway.com</a>.  Media Breakaway may also grant advertising clients and email services  providers’ access to an individual's email address to verify the origin  of the Individual Information collected.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</strong><br>
  <strong>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</strong><br>
  Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies  (together, “Advertisers”) who place advertisements on the Website and  on the Internet generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and  other technology to collect information about individuals. Media  Breakaway does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and  Media Breakaway has no responsibility for the use of such technology to  gather information about individuals.<br>
