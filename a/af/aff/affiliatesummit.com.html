                    <p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT, INC. all its related web sites (”AFFILIATE SUMMIT”) Privacy Policy</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. AFFILIATE SUMMIT DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO AFFILIATE SUMMIT OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of AFFILIATE SUMMIT:</p>
<p>This policy applies to AFFILIATE SUMMIT’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by AFFILIATE SUMMIT on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to AFFILIATE SUMMIT’s other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. AFFILIATE SUMMIT is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.</p>
<p>1. Collection of Information.</p>
<p>1.1 Survey Information.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an AFFILIATE SUMMIT survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, AFFILIATE SUMMIT or a third party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). AFFILIATE SUMMIT may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from AFFILIATE SUMMIT or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT.</p>
<p>1.2 Third Party List Information.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and AFFILIATE SUMMIT subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the “Seller”). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, “Third Party List Information”). When acquiring Third Party List Information, AFFILIATE SUMMIT seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to AFFILIATE SUMMIT and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller’s list.</p>
<p>1.3 Other Information.</p>
<p>Other occasions when AFFILIATE SUMMIT obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by AFFILIATE SUMMIT or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through AFFILIATE SUMMIT customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a AFFILIATE SUMMIT service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).</p>
<p>1.4 Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT currently uses cookie and pixel tag technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, AFFILIATE SUMMIT may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).</p>
<p>(a) Cookies.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows AFFILIATE SUMMIT to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in AFFILIATE SUMMIT database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>
<p>(b) Pixel Tags.</p>
<p>A pixel tag is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows AFFILIATE SUMMIT to track certain web sites an individual visits online.</p>
<p>(c) New Technology.</p>
<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is AFFILIATE SUMMIT’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, AFFILIATE SUMMIT strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<p>1.5 Outside Information.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of AFFILIATE SUMMIT including information located in public databases (”Outside Information”).</p>
<p>1.6 Individual Information.</p>
<p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information AFFILIATE SUMMIT gathers or receives about individuals.</p>
<p>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If AFFILIATE SUMMIT obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, AFFILIATE SUMMIT has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. AFFILIATE SUMMIT has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (”COPPA”).</p>
<p>1.8 Credit Card Information.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (”Credit Card Information”) when an individual places an order from AFFILIATE SUMMIT. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to AFFILIATE SUMMIT, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. AFFILIATE SUMMIT will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.</p>
<p>2. Use of Individual Information.</p>
<p>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</p>
<p>THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY’S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how AFFILIATE SUMMIT currently uses Individual Information, but AFFILIATE SUMMIT may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below, AFFILIATE SUMMIT may update this policy from time to time. AFFILIATE SUMMIT may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.</p>
<p>2.2 Email.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT uses Individual Information to provide newsletters and promotional offers by email to individuals. AFFILIATE SUMMIT may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all AFFILIATE SUMMIT email lists, a person must send an email to unsubscribe@affiliatesummit.com.</p>
<p>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</p>
<p>In certain commercial email messages sent by AFFILIATE SUMMIT, an advertiser’s name will appear in the “From:” line but hitting the “Reply” button will cause a reply email to be sent to AFFILIATE SUMMIT. The “Subject:” line of AFFILIATE SUMMIT email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to AFFILIATE SUMMIT.</p>
<p>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from AFFILIATE SUMMIT or to individuals who have agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as AFFILIATE SUMMIT. AFFILIATE SUMMIT does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to AFFILIATE SUMMIT email messages.</p>
<p>2.3 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones.</p>
<p>2.4 Profiles of Individuals.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.</p>
<p>2.5 Storage of Individual Information.</p>
<p>AFFILIATE SUMMIT stores the Individual Information in a database on AFFILIATE SUMMIT computers and Third Party computers. Our computers and our trusted third party provider computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under AFFILIATE SUMMIT’s control. Not withstanding such measures, AFFILIATE SUMMIT cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent AFFILIATE SUMMIT or its third party providers’ computers from being illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.</p>
