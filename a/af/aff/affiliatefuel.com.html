              this Privacy Policy periodically to note any changes that may have 
              occurred. An Affiliate (“Affiliate”) is a corporation, other legal 
              entity, or adult person that has applied to Thermo Media, and has 
              been accepted by Thermo Media into the Advertising Network (defined 
              below) in accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures outlined 
              in this Web site. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thermo Media 
              does not collect any personal information about visitors to, or 
              users of, this Web site solely as a result of such visits or usage, 
              other than persons or entities joining Thermo Media’s advertising 
              network (“Advertising Network”) of Web sites as an Affiliate pursuant 
              to either a written or online contract.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When an Internet 
              user clicks on one of Thermo Media's served advertisements (running 
              throughout the Advertising Network), Thermo Media does collect "ad 
              delivery and reporting data" (type of browser, operating system, 
              IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when 
              an Internet user has responded to an advertisement, etc.). None 
              of the data can be linked to any individual Internet user, and therefore 
              it cannot be used for personal identification or profiling. Thermo 
              Media does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding 
              the user that clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security 
              number, e-mail address, etc.).</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An Internet 
              user's browser normally places Cookies that contain small amounts 
              of data on the Internet user's computer after a visit to any Web 
              site. Cookies assist Thermo Media in tracking Internet users' activities 
              beginning from an Affiliate’s Web site or e-mail. If the Internet 
              user visits or revisits an advertiser’s site directly from such 
              Affiliate, Thermo Media is able to continue to track the Internet 
              user's activities on the advertiser's site and reward the Affiliate 
              that referred the Internet user. The Cookies tell Thermo Media nothing 
              about the Internet user personally.</font></p>

              are used (1) when an advertiser's banner image or other text is 
              loaded on a Web page for viewing by an Internet user, and (2) when 
              the banner or other text is clicked by an Internet user. The function 
              of these Cookies is to provide Thermo Media with information solely 
              for the purpose of paying an Affiliate’s commissions when an Internet 
              user clicks on a link or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Web 
              site. </font></p>
