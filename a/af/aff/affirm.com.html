This includes, but is not limited to, processing transactions, maintaining your account, responding to court orders and legal investigations, litigation purposes, complying with audits or other investigations, and reporting to credit bureaus. You may opt out of certain sharing as discussed in section 7 of this privacy policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                    7.1.    Notifications. If you no longer wish to receive notifications via our application, you can adjust your preferences accordingly. You may be able to change your notification preferences by accessing your account on the Website. Affirm reserves the right to close your account should you opt of the crucial notices that are required to perform the Affirm Service. You may not opt out of receiving notifications about due or past due amounts that you owe Affirm or any other collections efforts.
                    </p>

                    7.2.    SMS Messaging. You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by texting STOP to the number we send from for that particular service.

You can also close your account through the Website. If you close your Affirm account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
