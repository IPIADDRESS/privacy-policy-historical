					    <p>Thank you for visiting Affiliate Classroom, Inc.'s ("Affiliate  Classroom") personal data management and e-commerce Internet web site  ("Site") located at the URL www.affiliateclassroom.com.

					    <p><strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong> </p>
					    <p>					      Due to  the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Affiliate Classroom may need to update  this Privacy Policy from time to time. &nbsp;If  so, Affiliate Classroom will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site  located at www.affiliateclassroom.com so you are always aware of what  personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this  information. &nbsp;Affiliate Classroom  encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

					    <p>					      Advertisements  that appear on this Site are delivered to users by our advertising partners.  Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this  allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send  you an advertisement.

We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends,  administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use.&nbsp; We may  share this aggregate information with third parties to assist them in targeting  advertisements to appropriate audiences.</p>
					    <p><strong>Disclosure</strong> </p>
					    <p>					      We may  provide your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data  generated by cookies to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to  assist us.
