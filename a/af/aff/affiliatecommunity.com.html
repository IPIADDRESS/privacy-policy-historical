					<b>Last Updated: November 15, 2006</b><br>
					<br>
					www.affiliatecommunity.net (The Affiliate Community) strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
					technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information 
					(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will 
					never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."<br>
					<br>
					<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
					How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
					participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for 
					access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. 
					You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
					interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, www.affiliatecommunity.net also collects information automatically 
					and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
					your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among 
					other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information 
					each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our 
					site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you 
					can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but 
					if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and 
					password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.<br>
					<br>
					<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
					Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and 
					advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br>
					<br>
					Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, 
					we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
					enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). 
					Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
					does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.<br>
					<br>
					We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.affiliatecommunity.net to communicate with you about 
					your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered 
					by AmazingSiteBuilder.com and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br>
					<br>
					Personally Identifiable Information collected by www.affiliatecommunity.net may also be used for other purposes, 
					including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration 
					of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for 
					the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information 
					only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge 
					or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 
					We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
					required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement 
					authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to 
					disclosure in such cases.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
					www.affiliatecommunity.net expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be 
					aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
					accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
					during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a AmazingSiteBuilder.com page, certain 
					content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through www.affiliatecommunity.net you may be 
					introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
					www.affiliatecommunity.net is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the 
					applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a 
					third party.<br>
					<br>
					While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to 
					attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is 
					served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
					advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use 
					cookies or other technology to gather information. www.affiliatecommunity.net does not control the use of this 
					technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of 
					such third parties.<br>
					<br>
					You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
					chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
					and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control 
					of www.affiliatecommunity.net and this policy.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Children</b><br>
					The Affiliate Community does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children 
					under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation 
					of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe www.affiliatecommunity.net has any information 
					from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Changes to this Policy</b><br>
					www.affiliatecommunity.net reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for 
					changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 
					Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied 
					at the time the information was collected.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Governing law</b><br>
					This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Nevada law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first 
					try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Las Vegas. Any costs and 
					fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.<br>
					<br>
					If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute 
					to binding arbitration at the following location: Las Vegas, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. 
					Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.<br>
					<br>
					www.affiliatecommunity.net is controlled, operated and administered entirely within Nevada. This statement and the policies 
					outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.<br>
