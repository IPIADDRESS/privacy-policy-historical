      saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved information to 
      facilitate Your use of Our Web site when You return to the site. Cookies 
      do not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have chosen to provide 
      it to Us, nor does Your accepting a cookie in any way gives Us access to 
      Your computer. We never save passwords or credit card information in

      find that most major Web sites use them. </font></font></p>

      However, note that some parts of <b>RCI </b>and/or its affiliates' 
      services will not function properly or may be considerably slower if You

      travel preferences. Second, We use cookies to track users Web site usage 
      trends and patterns. This helps Us understand Our users needs better and
