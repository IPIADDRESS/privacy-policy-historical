<p><img src="images/title_privacy.gif" alt="Privacy Policy"></p>

<p>We at the <i>Armed Forces Vacation Club</i> (AFVC) and Resort Condominiums International, LLC, and the family of companies owned by Cendant Corporation, Our parent company (collectively referred to as "RCI," "We," "Us," or "Our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information or data collected about Our users, prospective users or other customers (collectively referred to as "Users," "You," or "Your"). This Privacy Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and how to correct or change it. At RCI, it is Our intention to give You an understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make of it in the course of Our business.


</p><h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p>Under California Law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (1) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please e-mail us at: feedback@afvclub.com or write to us at: AFVC Customer Service, 9998 North Michigan Road, Carmel, IN 46032 with a reference to California Disclosure Information.

</p><p>We will respond to such written requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. Please note that we are only required to respond to each customer once per calendar year.


</p><h3>Information Collection &amp; Use </h3>
<p>RCI collects two (2) types of information about its Users: 1) personally identifiable information that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Sites ("Personal Information"); and 2) aggregated (non-personally identifiable) information ("Aggregate Information") that RCI gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying Web page views throughout Our Web Sites. Such information enables Us to tailor Our content to fit Our Users' needs better and to help Our advertisers understand Our audience.
RCI also collects general business information relating to employees, contractors, shareholders, resort managers and other individuals. However, this privacy policy does not outline in detail the use of contractor and employee information.

</p><p>RCI only collects Personal Information that is necessary for business purposes. We collect Personal Information by specifically requesting it from You. Generally this occurs when You enroll in an RCI Exchange Program, register on one of Our Web Sites, request information from Us, participate in activities on Our Web Sites, such as promotional offers and sweepstakes. At such times, you give contact information such as name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When You purchase products and/ or services from Us, we will note, for example, your contact information, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. When other information such as, gender, age range, number of children, and product and/or service preferences, and related transactional information You may provide to us by any means, including but not limited to through Our Web-sites and through third parties, by e-mail, telephone, fax or mail, is associated with Personal Information, this other information also becomes Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personal Information does not include the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization, or the name, address or telephone number of a person that is available in a public telephone directory.


</p><h3>Usage tracking</h3>
<p>Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses. An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that Your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. This allows Us to identify and gather general information and data about You, such as the Web pages You view.

</p><p>RCI collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to Our business partners, and to audit the use of Our Web Site. When Users request pages from RCI's Web Sites, Our servers log the Users IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Users session will be logged, but the User will remain anonymous to Us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with Our Web Site terms of use or terms of service or to protect Our service, site, Users or others.


</p><h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on Your computer. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved information to facilitate Your use of Our Web site when You return to the site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless You have chosen to provide it to Us, nor does Your accepting a cookie in any way gives Us access to Your computer. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, You'll find that most major Web sites use them.

</p><p>By showing how and when Users use a site, cookies help Us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to Our Users' needs.

</p><p>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You can delete Your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of RCI's services will not function properly or may be considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, You will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions.

</p><p>RCI have two (2) primary uses for its cookies. First, We use them to specify a user's preferences. For example, users can specify keywords across several categories or markets so You don't have to tell Us repeatedly about Your travel preferences. Second, We use cookies to track users Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps Us understand Our users needs better and improve areas of RCI's services that Our Users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of disabling the cookies via Your browser preferences.

</p><p>You may occasionally get cookies from Our advertisers. RCI do not control these cookies and these cookies may not follow the rules we have set for our own cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.


</p><h3>Uses Of Personal Information</h3>
<p>As a general rule, RCI does not, and will not, do the following with Your Personal Information: (1) sell or rent Your Personal Information; (2) use the Personal Information We collect and store to make decisions about granting or extending consumer credit unless You submit a separate credit application and authorize Us to use or disclose this information; or (3) act as a consumer reporting agency, or furnish information about any User's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living to any consumer reporting agency.
</p><p>We will use and disclose Your Personal Information to others as stated in this RCI Privacy Policy. We may use Personal Information in many ways, including sending You information on products and/or services, special deals, promotions. We may share your Personal Information with third parties so that these third parties can send you promotional materials. We may use Personal Information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a product or service offered on Our Web sites), or to send You administrative communications either about Your membership with us or about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. We may use Personal Information to notify sweepstakes winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site, and to send emails. We also use Your Personal Information for internal quality assurance purposes.

</p><p>We may supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from third party sources. For example, We purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our marketing and to provide pertinent offers in which We think you would be interested. When we associate this information with Personal Information you have provided to Use, this other information also becomes Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

</p><p>Usually, RCIand RCI's business partners use Your information to operate the Web Sites and to deliver services. RCI also use Your information to inform You about other products and/or services available from RCI.



</p><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>As a general rule, We will not disclose Your Personal Information that you submit to Us in a manner that connects You with the Personal Information, except when We have Your permission or under special circumstances, such as when We believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.
