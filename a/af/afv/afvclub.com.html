      recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information 
      or data collected about Our users, prospective users or other customers 
      (collectively referred to as "Users," "You," or "Your"). This Privacy 
      Policy discloses what information We gather, how We use it, and how to 
      correct or change it. At <b>AFVC,</b> it is Our intention to give You an 
      understanding about how We collect Your information and the use We make of 
      it in the course of Our business.</p></font><b><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">
      <p>How do we collect information? </p></font><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">
      </font></b><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><p><b>We</b> gather two (2) types of information about Users: 1) data that 
      users provide through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Sites; 
      and 2) data <b>we</b> gather through aggregated tracking, mainly by 
      tallying Web page views throughout Our Web Sites. Such information enables 
      Us to tailor Our content to fit Our Users needs better and to help Our 
      advertisers understand Our audience. However, be assured that <b>we</b> 
      will not disclose information gathered by <b>us</b> from Your use of Our 
      Web Sites to third parties without Your consent, except as may be noted in 
      this Privacy Policy or disclosed to You when the information is 
      submitted.</p><b>
      </b><p><b>We</b> also collect general business information relating to employees, 
      contractors, shareholders, resort managers and other individuals. However, 
      this privacy policy does not outline in detail the use of contractor and 
      employee information.</p></font><b><u><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">

      You. Generally this occurs when You register at one of Our Web Sites or 
      request information or a service. Usually, the <b>AFVC</b> and <b>RCI</b> 
      Web Sites and our service partners use Your information to operate the Web 
      Sites and to deliver services. Our Web Sites also use Your information to 
      inform You about other products or services available from <b>RCI</b> and 
      its affiliates.<br><br></font><b><u><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">Usage tracking</font></u></b><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><br><br></font><u><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">Use 
      of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses</font></u><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><br>An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned 
      to Your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that Your 
      computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," 
      that "serve up" Web pages.<br><br><b>RCI</b> and/or its affiliates collect 
      IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report 
      aggregated information to Our advertisers, and to audit the use of Our Web 
      Site. When users request pages from <b>RCI's</b> and/or its affiliates' 
      Web Sites, Our servers log the users IP addresses. We do not normally link 
      IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a users 
      session will be logged, but the User will remain anonymous to Us. We can 
      and will use IP addresses to identify a User when We feel it is necessary 
      to enforce compliance with Our site terms of use or terms of service or to 
      protect Our service, site, other members or others.<br><br></font><u><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">Use Of Cookies</font></u><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><br>What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces 
      of information that a Web site sends to Your computer for record-keeping 
      purposes, which information is stored in a file on Your computer. Cookies 
      make Web-surfing easier for You by saving Your preferences so that We can 
      use the saved information to facilitate Your use of Our Web site when You 
      return to the site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless 
      You have chosen to provide it to Us, nor does Your accepting a cookie in 
      any way gives Us access to Your computer. We never save passwords or 
      credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry 
      standard, and as such, You'll find that most major Web sites use 
      them.<br><br>By showing how and when users use a site, cookies help Us see 
      which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates 
      to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages 
      viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the 
      information from cookies to provide services better tailored to Our Users' 
      needs.<br><br>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You 
      can delete Your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set 
      up to accept cookies. You can reset Your browser to refuse all cookies or 
      indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of 
      <b>RCI</b> and/or its affiliates' services will not function properly or 
      may be considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without 
      cookies, You will not be able to set personalized preferences, and/or may 
      have difficulty completing marketing transactions.<br><br><b>RCI</b> 
      and/or its affiliates have two (2) primary uses for its cookies. First, We 
      use them to specify a user’s preferences. For example, users can specify 
      keywords across several categories or markets so You don't have to tell Us 
      repeatedly about Your travel preferences. Second, We use cookies to track 
      users Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps Us understand Our 
      users needs better and improve areas of <b>RCI's</b> and/or its 
      affiliates' services that Our Users find valuable. While both of these 
      activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of disabling 
      the cookies via Your browser preferences. However, disabling the cookies 
      may prevent you from using certain features on the web site.

      business purposes. "Personal Information" is any information that in 
      itself or as part of a unique combination of information specifically 
      recognizes You by unique descriptors and/or identifiers. Examples of 
      Personal Information are name, address, credit card number, bank or 
      financial account number, social security number, income, and family 
      names. Personal Information does not include publicly available 
      information. As a general rule, <b>RCI</b> does not and will not sell Your 
      Personal Information to anyone. We will only use and disclose Your 
      Personal Information that You submit to Us with others as stated in this 
      RCI Privacy Policy. </p></font><b><font face="Verdana,Arial" color="#ff0000" size="2">

      <p>Our purpose in collecting information about You is to provide You with 
      membership services, such as exchanging Your vacation accommodation

      ways in operating Our membership programs and operating Our business, and 
      most of these uses are clear from the circumstances. We also use Your

      requested such as to make bookings for your travel with airlines. <b>RCI 
      </b>may also disclose some or all of Your Personal Information to business 
      partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically described to You 
      prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Many 
      promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from 
      sponsors. By requesting more information, You give <b>RCI</b> permission 
      to transfer Your Personal Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill 
      Your request. In many instances, only Your e-mail address will be shared.
