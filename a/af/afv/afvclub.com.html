      </p><div class="vtTitleCurveTD1Bg"><strong>Information Collection 
&amp; Use</strong>   </div>
  

          RCI collects two (2) types of information about its 
            Users: 1) personally identifiable information that users provide 
            through optional, voluntary registration on Our Web Sites ("Personal 
            Information"); and 2) aggregated (non-personally identifiable) 
            information ("Aggregate Information") that RCI gathers through 
            aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying Web page views throughout 
            Our Web Sites. Such information enables Us to tailor Our content to 
            fit Our Users' needs better and to help Our advertisers understand 
            Our audience. 
            <p>RCI also collects general business information relating to 
            employees, contractors, shareholders, resort managers and other 
            individuals. However, this privacy policy does not outline in detail 
            the use of contractor and employee information. 
            </p><p>RCI only collects Personal Information that is necessary for 
            business purposes. We collect Personal Information by specifically 
            requesting it from You. Generally this occurs when You enroll in an 
            RCI Exchange Program, register on one of Our Web Sites, request 
            information from Us, participate in activities on Our Web Sites, 
            such as promotional offers and sweepstakes. At such times, you give 
            contact information such as name, postal address, e-mail address, 
            and telephone number. When You purchase products and/ or services 
            from Us, we will note, for example, your contact information, credit 
            card information, the type of services or products ordered or 
            purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. When other 
            information such as, gender, age range, number of children, and 
            product and/or service preferences, and related transactional 
            information You may provide to us by any means, including but not 
            limited to through Our Web-sites and through third parties, by 
            e-mail, telephone, fax or mail, is associated with Personal 
            Information, this other information also becomes Personal 
            Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personal 
            Information does not include the name, title or business address or 
            telephone number of an employee of an organization, or the name, 
            address or telephone number of a person that is available in a 
            public telephone directory.

      </p><div class="vtTitleCurveTD1Bg"><strong>Usage 
tracking</strong> </div>

          <span class="body2bold">Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") 
            Addresses</span>. An IP address is a unique number that is 
            automatically assigned to Your computer whenever you're surfing the 
            Internet so that Your computer can be identified by the main 
            computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages. This 
            allows Us to identify and gather general information and data about 
            You, such as the Web pages You view. 
            <p>RCI collects IP addresses for the purposes of system 
            administration, to report aggregated information to Our business 
            partners, and to audit the use of Our Web Site. When Users request 
            pages from RCI's Web Sites, Our servers log the Users IP addresses. 
            We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally 
            identifiable, which means that a Users session will be logged, but 
            the User will remain anonymous to Us. We can and will use IP 
            addresses to identify a User when We feel it is necessary to enforce 
            compliance with Our Web Site terms of use or terms of service or to 
            protect Our service, site, Users or others.

<p><br>
</p><p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
  
          <span class="body2bold">What are cookies?</span> 
            Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to 
            Your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is 
            stored in a file on Your computer. Cookies make Web-surfing easier 
            for You by saving Your preferences so that We can use the saved 
            information to facilitate Your use of Our Web site when You return 
            to the site. Cookies do not tell Us Your individual identity unless 
            You have chosen to provide it to Us, nor does Your accepting a 
            cookie in any way gives Us access to Your computer. We never save 
            passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies 
            is an industry standard, and as such, You'll find that most major 
            Web sites use them. 
            </p><p>By showing how and when Users use a site, cookies help Us see 
            which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and 
            updates to the site are based on such data as total number of 
            visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked 
            with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide 
            services better tailored to Our Users' needs. 
            </p><p>Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or You can 
            delete Your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set 
            up to accept cookies. You can reset Your browser to refuse all 
            cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that 
            some parts of RCI's services will not function properly or may be 
            considerably slower if You refuse cookies. For example, without 
            cookies, You will not be able to set personalized preferences, 
            and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions. 
            </p><p>RCI have two (2) primary uses for its cookies. First, We use them 
            to specify a user's preferences. For example, users can specify 
            keywords across several categories or markets so You don't have to 
            tell Us repeatedly about Your travel preferences. Second, We use 
            cookies to track users Web site usage trends and patterns. This 
            helps Us understand Our users needs better and improve areas of 
            RCI's services that Our Users find valuable. While both of these 
            activities depend on the use of cookies, You have the option of 
            disabling the cookies via Your browser preferences. 
            </p><p>You may occasionally get cookies from Our advertisers. RCI do not 
            control these cookies and these cookies may not follow the rules we 
            have set for our own cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by 
            third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 
        </p>
<p><br>
</p><p>

      </p><div class="vtTitleCurveTD1Bg"><strong>Uses Of Personal 
Information</strong>   </div>
  
          As a general rule, RCI does not, and will not, do the 
            following with Your Personal Information: (1) sell or rent Your 
            Personal Information; (2) use the Personal Information We collect 
            and store to make decisions about granting or extending consumer 
            credit unless You submit a separate credit application and authorize 
            Us to use or disclose this information; or (3) act as a consumer 
            reporting agency, or furnish information about any User's credit 
            worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general 
            reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living to any 
            consumer reporting agency. 
            <p>We will use and disclose Your Personal Information to others as 
            stated in this RCI Privacy Policy. We may use Personal Information 
            in many ways, including sending You information on products and/or 
            services, special deals, promotions. We may share your Personal 
            Information with third parties so that these third parties can send 
            you promotional materials. We may use Personal Information to 
            complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a 
            product or service offered on Our Web sites), or to send You 
            administrative communications either about Your membership with us 
            or about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to 
            this Privacy Policy. We may use Personal Information to notify 
            sweepstakes winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or 
            personalize the site, and to send emails. We also use Your Personal 
            Information for internal quality assurance purposes. 
            </p><p>We may supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us 
            with information from third party sources. For example, We purchase 
            marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user 
            database, to better target our marketing and to provide pertinent 
            offers in which We think you would be interested. When we associate 
            this information with Personal Information you have provided to Use, 
            this other information also becomes Personal Information for 
            purposes of this Privacy Policy. 
            </p><p>Usually, RCIand RCI's business partners use Your information to 
            operate the Web Sites and to deliver services. RCI also use Your 
            information to inform You about other products and/or services 
            available from RCI. </p>
<p><br>
</p><p>

      </p><div class="vtTitleCurveTD1Bg"><strong>Information Sharing and 
Disclosure</strong>   
</div>
          As a general rule, We will not disclose Your Personal 
            Information that you submit to Us in a manner that connects You with 
            the Personal Information, except when We have Your permission or 
            under special circumstances, such as when We believe in good faith 
            that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. 
            The following describes some of the ways that Your Personal 
            Information may be disclosed. 
            <p><strong><span class="body2bold">Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</span>:</strong> 
            RCI provides Personal Information to resort operators in order to 
            facilitate a booking that You have requested or to generate leads to 
            timeshare developers in connection with their offers to sell 
            timeshares to You. Otherwise RCI does not routinely disclose 
            Personal Information, except where it is necessary to provide you 
            with a service that You have requested such as (1) to make bookings 
            for your travel with airlines or (2) to respond to Your inquiry for 
            further information about mini-vacations at resorts (which are 
            offered by timeshare developers), where a tour of the resorts is 
            either required or requested of You by the timeshare developers. RCI 
            may also disclose some or all of Your Personal Information to 
            business partners or sponsors. Many promotions offer opportunities 
            to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting such 
            information, You give RCI permission to transfer Your Personal 
            Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill Your request. 
            </p><p><span class="body2bold"><strong>Third 
Party &amp; Aggregate Data</strong>    </span>: 
            From time to time, You may be offered the opportunity to receive 
            materials or special offers from third parties. If You opt to 
            receive information from these third parties, RCI will share Your 
            name, e-mail address and other Personal Information with such third 
            parties. Under confidentiality agreements with third party service 
            providers, RCI may match Personal Information with third party data. 
            Also, RCI may keep track of what portions of the Web site users are 
            visiting and other user statistics, and aggregate this information 
            to help Us create a better experience for users of Our Web site. 
            This is done in order to describe Our viewers and services to 
            prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for 
            other lawful purposes. 
            </p><p><span class="body2bold"><strong>Other</strong></span>: RCI may disclose Personal 
            Information and/or account information if required to do so by law, 
            court order or as requested by a governmental or law enforcement 
            authority or in special cases when We have reason to believe that 
            disclosing this Personal Information is otherwise necessary or 
            advisable (regardless of whether You have "opted out" from having 
            Your Personal Information shared). Situations may include: to 
            perform, maintain or enforce contracts formed between Us and our 
            members and/or customers, to protect the rights or properties of 
            RCI, Our members or others, or when We have reason to believe that 
            disclosing the information is necessary or advisable, including but 
            not limited to, the following situations: to identify, contact or 
            bring legal action against someone who may be violating RCI's terms 
            of use or terms of service, or may be causing or threatening to 
            cause injury or damage to or interference with (either intentionally 
            or unintentionally) any of RCI's rights or properties, or the rights 
            or properties of RCI's employees, or customers ,other RCI users, or 
            anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Further, RCI 
            may disclose Personal Information or access account information for 
            administrative and other purposes that We deem necessary, in Our 
            sole discretion, to maintain, service, and improve Our Web site, 
            information, products and/or services.

          In case You change Your mind about Personal Information that you

or otherwise changes (such as Your zip code or e-mail address), We will try to

      </p><div class="vtTitleCurveTD1Bg"><strong>What happens when You 
link to a third party Web site?</strong>         
       </div>
          You should be aware that when You are on RCI's Web 
            Sites You could hyperlink or be directed to other Web sites that are 
            beyond Our control and/or outside Our service. For example, if You 
            "click" on a banner advertisement or a RCI search result, the 
            "click" may transfer You off the RCI Web Sites. Once you link to a 
            third party web site and leave our Web Site, your interaction with 
            these third party web sites will no longer be governed by our Terms 
            of Use or Privacy Policy. These third party web sites may have 
            separate privacy and data collection practices, and security 
            measures. These other Web sites may include Web sites of 
            advertisers, timeshare developers, resort operators, sponsors and 
            partners that may use RCI's logo as part of a co-branding agreement, 
            although the use of such logo(s) does not imply any endorsement by 
            RCI of the material, content, products, services or information on 
            or at such sites or any association with their operators. These 
            other Web sites may send their own cookies to users and members, 
            collect data, or solicit personal information. 
            <p>RCI does not control such Web sites, and, therefore, is not 
            responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they 
            choose to place on such Web sites; accordingly, your use of these 
            third party sites is at your own risk and are subject to the terms 
            of use and policies set forth at such sites. RCI's inclusion of 
            hyperlinks to these third party Web sites do not imply any 
            endorsement of the material on such Web sites or any association 
            with their owners or operators. Given that we have no control over 
            such Web sites, RCI has no responsibility or liability for the 
            practices, policies and security measures implemented by such third 
            parties on their Web sites. We encourage you to contact these third 
            parties to ask questions about their terms of use, privacy 
            practices, policies and security measures before disclosing 
            Personally Identifiable Information on linked web sites. RCI's 
            policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation 
            of the Internet, which is beyond RCI's control. 
            </p><p>Please keep in mind that whenever You give out information online 
            (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be 
            collected and used by people You don't know. While RCI strives to 
            protect their Users' Personal Information and privacy, We cannot 
            guarantee the security of any information You disclose online, and 
            You disclose such information at Your own risk.

Personal Information from others using the RCI Web Sites?</strong>       
           </div>
  
          The security of all information associated with Our 
            Users is an important concern to Us. We reasonable exercise care in 
            providing secure transmission of Your information from Your computer 
            to Our servers. Unfortunately, given that we do not control 
            transmissions or traffic over the Internet or through third party 
            communication service providers, we cannot guarantee or warrant the 
            security of such transmission or your Personal Information. Your use 
            of the Internet and our Web Site, including your transmission of 
            Information to us, is at Your own risk. Notwithstanding, once We 
            receive Your transmission, RCI uses industry standard efforts 
            designed to safeguard Your Personal Information, such as firewalls 
            and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist 
            on the Internet.
