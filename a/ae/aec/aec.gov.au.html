            <h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
            <p>This  policy applies to personal information collected by the Australian Electoral Commission (the ‘AEC’). The purpose of the policy is to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>clearly communicate the personal information handling practices of the AEC</li>
                <li>enhance  the transparency of AEC operations, and</li>
                <li>&nbsp;provide individuals with a better and more complete understanding of the sort of personal information the AEC holds, and the way the AEC handles that information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The AEC is bound by the provisions of the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em>, (Privacy Act) including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).&nbsp; The APPs set out standards, rights and  obligations for how we handle and maintain personal information. This includes  how we collect, store, use, disclose, quality assure and secure personal  information, as well as your rights to access or correct your personal  information.</p>
            <h3>1.1 The  Australian Electoral Commission</h3>
            <p>The AEC is established  under the <a href="/act"><em>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</em></a> (Electoral Act) comprising a Chairperson,  the Electoral Commissioner and one other member. The AEC is an entity for the  purposes of the Privacy Act.</p>
            <p>The Electoral Commissioner and the Australian Public Service employees who assist the  Commissioner together constitute a Statutory Agency and the Electoral Commissioner is the principal executive of the agency.</p>
            <p>The AEC has seven core business functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>managing  the Commonwealth electoral Roll,</li>
                <li>conducting  elections, referendums, including industrial and fee-for-service elections and  protected action ballots,</li>
                <li>educating  and informing the community about electoral rights and responsibilities,</li>
                <li>providing  research, advice and assistance on electoral matters to the Parliament, other  government agencies and recognised bodies,</li>
                <li>providing  assistance in overseas elections and referendums in support of wider government  initiatives,</li>
                <li>administering  election funding, financial disclosure and party registration requirements, and</li>
                <li>supporting  electoral redistributions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2 Anonymity  and pseudonymity</h3>
            <p>In general, you have the right to interact  anonymously or pseudonymously with the AEC. There are circumstances, however,  where it is impractical for us to deal with individuals without knowing the  identity of the individuals.&nbsp; This is  particularly the case when interacting with the AEC in the performance of our  statutory functions relating to the enrolment of electors and the conduct of  elections.&nbsp; As these matters involve the  exercise of individual rights and obligations, the AEC will require evidence of  identity to enable the administration of those statutory functions to take  place.</p>
            <p>If you are  seeking information of a general nature from the AEC, it is unlikely that you  will be required to provide your real identity for that purpose. In general,  you will not be disadvantaged by dealing anonymously or pseudonymously with us.  However, without knowing your real identity, the type of information we are  able to provide to you may be limited.</p>
            <p>The Electoral Act prohibits the disclosure of information about one  person to another person except in limited, specified circumstances. Those  circumstances do not include requests by third parties for access to personal  information held by the AEC, including requests by authorised representatives  of an individual unless there is a specific authorisation that refers to the  particular information in the possession of the AEC.</p>
            <p>Before disclosing  your confidential or personal information to you, the AEC will need to  establish your identity.This is for the purpose of protecting you against the  unauthorised disclosure of personal information that is in the possession of  the AEC. Similarly, if you are seeking information about specific  circumstances, we may be unable provide information without knowing the  specific details of your request (which may require that you disclose your  identity to us).</p>
            <p>If you wish to  deal anonymously or pseudonymously with the AEC, please advise us as early as  possible.</p>
            <h2 id="personal">2. Personal information handling practices</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Collection of personal information</h3>
            <h4>2.1.1 Means of collection</h4>
            <p>In carrying out its functions and activities, the AEC usually  collects personal information about individuals directly from those individuals  or their authorised representative(s). In certain circumstances we may also obtain  personal information from third parties including that which is collected by  other Australian, state and territory government bodies or organisations.</p>
            <p>We only collect personal information from a third party or from a  publicly available source, if:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>the  individual has consented to such collection or would reasonably expect the AEC  to collect his or her personal information in this way, or</li>
                <li>it  is collected only when it is necessary for, or directly related to AEC  functions or activities under the the Electoral Act and the <a href="/ref-act"><em>Referendum (Machinery  Provisions) Act 1984</em></a> (the ‘Referendum Act’) and subordinate laws made  under those Acts (collectively referred to as ‘Electoral Legislation’) . </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We collect  this personal information in a variety of ways, including paper-based forms, by  electronic means including online (through our website, as well as email), over  the telephone and by fax.</p>
            <h4>2.1.2 Kinds of personal  information collected </h4>
            <p>The AEC only collects personal information where that information is  reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions  or activities.</p>
            <p>The AEC maintains an impartial and  independent electoral system for eligible voters through active electoral Roll  management, efficient delivery of polling services and targeted education and  public awareness programs.</p>
            <p>The personal  information we collect and hold will vary depending on what we require to  perform our functions and responsibilities. It may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>information about your identity (such as date of  birth, country of birth, passport details, visa details, photographs  and drivers licence)</li>
                <li>name, address and contact details (such as telephone,  email and facsimile)</li>
                <li>information about your personal circumstances  (such as age, gender, marital status and occupation)</li>
                <li>information about your financial affairs (such  as payment details, bank account details, and information about business and  financial interests)</li>
                <li>information about your employment (such as  applications for employment, work history, referee comments and remuneration)</li>
                <li>government identifiers</li>
                <li>the management of contracts</li>
                <li>correspondence from members of the public or  organisations to the AEC, the Special Minister of State and other Australian Government  ministers and parliamentary secretaries, including submissions to consultations</li>
                <li>complaints (including complaints relating to  privacy) and feedback provided to us</li>
                <li>requests made to us under the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/series/c2004a02562"><em>Freedom of Information Act 1982</em></a> (FOI Act)</li>
                <li>legal advice provided by internal and external  lawyers</li>
                <li>employment and  personnel matters for our staff and contractors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The APPs place more stringent obligation on entities when they handle ‘sensitive information’<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>. Generally, we will only collect sensitive information if you consent and it is  reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions  or activities. Sometimes we may collect or deal with sensitive personal  information without your consent, such as when it is required or authorised by  a law, or court or tribunal order. This  includes express statutory provisions, as well as the more general application  of the common law and the exercise of the Executive authority of the Australian  Government.</p>
            <p>The range of  sensitive personal information we may collect and hold, includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>racial or ethnic origin</li>
                <li>health (including information about medical history and any disability or injury)</li>
                <li>criminal activities, and</li>
                <li>biometrics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.2 Use and disclosure of  personal information </h3>
            <p>The AEC collects and holds personal information for the purpose of carrying  out its functions and activities. In some cases, the AEC may use or disclose  personal information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected,  but we will not give your personal information to other government  agencies, private sector organisations, or anyone else unless you consent or  one of the following exceptions applies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you would reasonably expect us to use the  information for that other purpose</li>
                <li>it is legally required or authorised, such as by  an Australian law, or court or tribunal order. This includes express statutory  provisions, as well as the more general application of the common law and the  exercise of the Executive authority of an Australian government</li>
                <li>we reasonably believe that it is necessary to  lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any  individual, or to public health or safety</li>
                <li>we have reason to suspect that unlawful  activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to our functions or  activities has been, is being or may be engaged in and we reasonably believe  that it is necessary in order for us to take appropriate action in relation to  the matter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Electoral Act prohibits the disclosure of information about one  person to another person except in limited, specified circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Electoral Act provides for  public inspection of the Commonwealth electoral Roll.</p>
            <p>The Electoral Act also provides  for lawful disclosure of electoral Roll information to a range of organisations  but it also precludes any further use or disclosure of that personal  information for other than a permitted purpose.</p>
            <p>Access to personal information by third parties including requests by  authorised representatives of an individual is only permitted when there is a  specific authorisation that refers to the particular information in the  possession of the AEC.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the Electoral Act that authorises the recipient of a  power of attorney to do anything that an elector is required to do merely by  virtue of holding that power of attorney. Accordingly the AEC will not disclose  personal information in the absence of a specific authorisation even where a  power of attorney has been given.</p>
            <h4>2.2.1 Disclosure  of personal information to overseas recipients </h4>
            <p>Most  personal information collected and held by the AEC will not be disclosed to anyone  who is overseas. We may need to provide your personal information to an overseas  recipient as part of our work. The Electoral Act enables certain  electors residing outside Australia to be included on the electoral Roll.  Information may be provided to an AEC service provider who delivers services  for the AEC to overseas electors. </p>
            <p>If we are  unable to seek your consent to provide your personal information to an overseas  recipient, or it is impractical to do so, we will only provide your personal  information to an overseas recipient if we are allowed to do so under the  Privacy&nbsp;Act.</p>
            <h3>2.3 Access and correction </h3>
            <p>You have a  right to access personal information we hold about you.&nbsp; That right of access must be exercised by you  as an individual and not your nominated representative unless you have given a specific  authorisation that refers to the particular information in the possession of  the AEC. A power of attorney will not suffice as the authorisation.</p>
            <p>You also  have a right under the Privacy Act to request corrections to any personal  information that we hold about you if you think the information is inaccurate,  out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. </p>
            <p>If you wish to  request access or correction, please contact the AEC's Privacy Contact Officer.  Before providing access to or correcting personal information about you, we will  require you to verify your identity.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to access and correct documents held by us under the FOI Act. In some circumstances we will suggest that you make your request under the FOI Act. This is because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an FOI access request can relate to any document  in our possession and is not limited to personal information </li>
                <li>the FOI Act contains a consultation process for  dealing with requests for documents that contain personal or business  information about another person </li>
                <li>you can complain to the Australian Information  Commissioner about what we do under the FOI&nbsp;Act</li>
                <li>if you are refused access under the FOI Act you  have a right to apply for internal review or Information Commissioner review of  the access refusal decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Find out more information about how to make a request under  the FOI Act on the <a href="/information-access/index.htm#foi">Freedom  of Information</a> page.</p>
    
            <h4>2.3.1 Refusal to give access or to correct  information</h4>
            <p>The Privacy Act  and the FOI Act sets out circumstances in which we can decline access to or  correction of personal information. This includes situations where we are  authorised or required to refuse access.</p>
            <p>Generally, where we refuse to give you access, we will give you written notice of the  reasons for refusal and the mechanisms available to you to dispute that  decision.</p>
            <h3>2.4 Integrity  of personal information</h3>
            <p>The Privacy  Act requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal  information we hold is safe and secure. We are also required to take reasonable  steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect is accurate,  up-to-date, and complete. This may include correcting your personal information  where it is appropriate to do so.</p>
            <h4>2.4.1 Security  of personal information</h4>
            <p>We aim to protect your personal information from loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse.&nbsp; Among other things, we safeguard our Information  and communications technology (ICT) systems against unauthorised access, and  ensure that paper-based files are secured. We also ensure that access to your  personal information within our systems is only available to those people who  need to have access in order to do electoral work.</p>
            <p>If a data  breach occurs, such as if personal information that we hold is subject to  unauthorised loss, use or disclosure, we will respond in line with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner’s <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-guides/data-breach-notification-a-guide-to-handling-personal-information-security-breaches"><em>Data breach notification  —A guide to handling  personal information security breaches</em></a>. We will aim to provide timely advice to you to ensure you are able to  manage any loss—financial or otherwise—that could result from the breach.</p>
            <h4>2.4.2 Retention and destruction of records</h4>
            <p>AEC records, including records containing personal information, and electoral documents are  created, kept and destroyed in accordance with the <em>Archives Act 1983</em> (Archives Act) and the preservation and  destruction provisions in the Electoral Act. </p>
            <p>When the personal information that we collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>is no longer required, and there is no law, or  court or tribunal order requiring it to be maintained, or</li>
                <li>becomes subject to the destruction requirements in  the Electoral Act</li>
            </ul>
            <p>we delete or destroy it in a secure manner.</p>
            <h4>2.4.3 Complaints</h4>
            <up>If you  believe the AEC has breached any of the APPs, you may submit a complaint to the  AEC. Complaints must be made in writing to the Privacy Contact Officer at the  email or postal address listed in this policy. <p></p>
            <p>You may submit a complaint anonymously.  However, in order to properly consider and respond to your request, the AEC may  require further information from you. Therefore, please include your contact  details if you submit a complaint.</p>
            <p>The AEC will respond to complaints within 30 days of receipt. If you are  dissatisfied with the AEC's response to a complaint, you may complain to the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au" title="Go to the OAIC website">OAIC</a>. The OAIC is an independent external body. Our contact details are set out in Section 4 below.</p>
            <h2 id="website">3. The AEC website: protecting your privacy online</h2>
            <p>The AEC is committed to protecting privacy online in accordance with the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-guides/guidelines-for-federal-and-act-government-websites">Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Websites</a> issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
            <h3>3.1 Personal information submitted to the AEC electronically</h3>
            <p>Where the  AEC collects personal information submitted directly by a user, those electronic  records are stored securely in databases managed on behalf of the AEC by its ICT providers and in accordance with the AEC's ICT security policies and  practices.</p>
            <p>Where personal information is held in  electronic files, access to it is restricted to AEC employees whose duties  require access to the information.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Personal  Information collected and held</h3>
            <p>The AEC automatically collects  generic information about all visitors to its online resources. That  information is very limited and only used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>identify  generic online resource usage patterns</li>
                <li>improve  our services, and</li>
                <li>manage  the AEC's servers, including maintaining security.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When visiting the AEC website  the site server makes a record of the visit and logs the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the user’s server's IP (Internet Protocol) address, a number which is unique to the machine through which the user is connected to  the internet</li>
                <li>the  user's server address – this allows us to consider the visitors who use the site most, and tailor the site to their interests and needs</li>
                <li>the  user's operating system (for example Windows, Mac etc.) – this allows us to  tailor browser or platform specific parts of the site to each operating system  because browsers act differently on each platform</li>
                <li>the  user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au etc.) – this can  allow us to tailor information relevant to different domains</li>
                <li>the  date and time of the visit to the site – this is important for identifying the  website's busy times and ensuring maintenance on the site is conducted outside  these periods</li>
                <li>pages  accessed and documents downloaded – this indicates to us which pages or  documents are most important to our users and also helps identify important  information that may be difficult to find</li>
                <li>duration  of the visit – this indicates to us how interesting and informative our site is  to our users</li>
                <li>geographic  location – this shows us how well marketed our site is</li>
                <li>the address  of the referring site, such as the previous site that you visited before the AEC website – this helps us  determine which sites are providing links to ours as well as sites where we may  be able to seek links</li>
                <li>the  type of browser used – this is important for browser specific coding, for  example JavaScript. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This  information is used only for statistical analysis and systems administration  purposes. No attempt is made to identify users or their browsing activities,  except in the unlikely event of an investigation by a law enforcement agency. </p>
            <h3>3.3 ‘Cookies’</h3>
            <p>A ‘cookie’ is an electronic token that is passed to your browser which passes it back to  the server whenever a page is sent to you.</p>
            <p>The AEC website uses a cookie to maintain contact through a session. The cookie allows the website to recognise you as a  unique user as you move from one page of the website to another. The cookie will expire when the browser session is closed or the computer is shut down. No attempt will be made to identify anonymous users or their browsing activities  unless legally compelled to do so, such as in the event of an investigation.</p>
            <h3>3.4 Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>In addition  to web server logs, the AEC website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics  service provided by Google Inc. Reports obtained from Google Analytics are used  to help improve the efficiency and usability of this web site.</p>
            <p>Google  Analytics uses 'cookies' to help analyse how users use this site. The  information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including  your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the  United States.</p>

Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so  by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.  Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>
            <p>By using the  AEC’s website, you consent to Google processing data about you in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Please refer to <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            <h3>3.5 Searches</h3>
            <p>Search  terms you enter when using the AEC search engine are collected, but are not associated with any other information that we collect. We use these search  terms to ascertain what people are looking for on our site and to improve the  services that we provide. </p>
            <h3>3.6 Interaction between this site and other sites</h3>
            <p>The AEC website contains links to  other sites. The AEC is not  responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and has  no knowledge if cookies or other tracking devices are used on linked websites.</p>
            <p>These other sites may use web  measurement tools, customisation technologies and persistent cookies to inform  the service they provide to their users. You should read the privacy statement  published on each website that you visit. </p>
            <h3>3.7 Your email address</h3>
            <p>The AEC will only record your email address in the event that you send a  message by email, you register requesting notifications, you provide your email  address when completing a claim for enrolment, or your email address is  provided by a third party. Registration for notifications may be made initially  by email, postal mail or facsimile. Your email address will only be used for  the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to any mailing  lists without your consent by way of a specific request in writing. The AEC  will not use or disclose your email address for any other purpose, without your  prior written consent.</p>
            <p>If you are listed on one or more of our media or subscriber email lists you can opt out at any time. You can <a href="http://apps.aec.gov.au/subscribe/Unsubscribe.aspx">unsubscribe</a> online or by using the ‘unsubscribe’ option noted in our subscriber emails .</p>
            <h3>3.8 Security  of information</h3>
            <p>The AEC provides a secure environment with data  usually secured in transit between your computer and our servers through the  use of encryption technology (SSL/TLS Certificates). The AEC has a reliable  system with data stored securely in databases managed on behalf of the AEC by  its ICT providers and in  accordance with the AEC's ICT security policies and practices.</p>
            <p>While every effort is made to secure information transmitted  to the AEC &nbsp;website over the internet, there may be  inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet  and there is therefore a possibility that this information could be  accessed by a third party while in transit.</p>
            <p>For those who  do not wish to use the Internet, the AEC provides alternative ways of obtaining  and providing information.</p>
