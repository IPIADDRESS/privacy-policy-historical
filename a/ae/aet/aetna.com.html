	Welcome to Aetna Inc.’s websites. We appreciate your interest in us. When you visit and navigate
 our sites and when you communicate with us via our sites, we will not collect personal information about
 you, unless you provide us that information voluntarily. If you provide personal information to us voluntarily
 via our websites, we will not sell, license or transmit that information outside of Aetna Inc. and those
 affiliated companies involved in administering or providing services for our health benefits plans and
 financial products, unless required to do so by legal, judicial or governmental proceedings, or unless
 we do so in accordance with an express authorization you have given us. Also, in some cases, we may disclose
 information to our contractors or agents for the purpose of enabling them to perform certain functions for us.
 We will disclose information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and will require the recipient
 to protect the information and use it only for the purpose provided.<br><br>

By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, social
 security number, or telephone number. From time to time, we may request personal information from you at
 our sites in order to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service.

 We will share your comments and questions with our customer service representatives and those employees most

	Please note that your e-mail, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications,
 may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit 
to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that
 you consider confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided at 
various locations on our sites or, in the case of our health plan members, at the Member Services toll free
 number that appears on your identification card.  <br><br>

There are some locations on Aetna Inc.’s websites where we have made special provisions for a more
 secure environment in which we can exchange information with you.  At each of these locations, we

	You should also be aware that when you visit our websites, we collect certain information
 that does not identify you personally, but provides us with “usage data,” such as the number of visitors
 we receive or what pages are visited most often. This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness
 of the information we provide at these websites. <br><br>

Like most commercial website owners, we may also use what is known as “cookie” technology.
 A “cookie” is an element of data that a website can send to your browser when you link to
 that website. It is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on your
computer or instruct it to perform any step or function.  By assigning a unique data element 
to each visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better
 serve you when you return to that site. The cookie does not extract other personal information 
about you, such as your name or address.   Most browsers provide a simple procedure that will enable
 you to control whether you want to receive cookies by notifying you when a website is about to deposit
 a cookie file. <br><br>
