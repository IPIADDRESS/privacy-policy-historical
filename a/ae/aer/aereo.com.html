	<p class="legal">Personal Data: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register to become an Aereo Member, become an Aereo User and/or contact us with inquiries that may contain such data. Please note that when you register to become an Aereo Member, certain Personal Data, including credit and payment card information, may be provided to an outside billing company, called Vindicia , Inc.

In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your Personal Data and/or Other Data.</p>

	<p class="legal"><em>Legal Requirements</em>: Aereo may disclose your Personal Data and/or Other Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or a government request, (ii) verify compliance with or enforce our  <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> or protect and defend the rights or property of Aereo, Aereo Users or others (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Aereo Members, Aereo Users or the public and/or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

For example, if you log in to Aereo using a social networking service, or if you voluntarily provide information through posts or sharing to a Third Party Service, information that you share via that service may be reflected on the Aereo Platform. Likewise, if you enable Aereo to have access to an email contact through a Third Party Service, Aereo may use that data to send an invitation or market to that contact.</p>

	<p class="legal">When you log into or use Aereo using your Third Party Services account, we will collect and share relevant information necessary to enable the Aereo website or account to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service.

	<p class="legal">However, no Internet or email transmission or electronic storage of information is ever completely secure or error free. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. You should take special care in deciding what information you send via Aereo. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data and/or Other Data to Aereo or utilizing any social networking features in connection with Aereo.</p>
