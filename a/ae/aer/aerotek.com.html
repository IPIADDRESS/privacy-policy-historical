<p><strong>What is HotJar?</strong></p>
<p>Hotjar is a technology service that records user sessions anonymously and captures information—such as what links users are clicking on, or how much time users spend on a page—to help us understand how our users interact with our website. HotJar compiles this information across multiple user sessions and displays it as a visual “heat map” that shows where user interactions occur on a given page.

<p><strong>How does HotJar work?</strong></p>
<p>Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to track and collect data on our website users’ interactions as well as device information such as device’s IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only, and preferred language. HotJar stores this information in an anonymized user profile.</p>
<p><strong>Does HotJar record, capture or store any sensitive information or personal data?</strong></p>

We will also never place HotJar on pages that contain forms or other places where users can enter personal data. For further details, please see Hotjar’s privacy policy by clicking on <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy">this link</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a user from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.&nbsp; In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and to communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest; for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our services, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.&nbsp; We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>
<p>You may choose to provide your personal information with Allegis Group for a particular position for which you are not successful. In such a situation, as you have indicated that you are looking for opportunities beyond your current role, Allegis may retain your personal information in order to present you with other opportunities for which your experience may be suitable. If you have concerns about Allegis Group retaining this data for these purposes please discuss them with your contact at Allegis Group.</p>
