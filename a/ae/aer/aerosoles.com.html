        <b>The Privacy of Aerosoles.com Customers Transaction Security</b><br>
        <br>
        When you use a credit card to make a purchase at Aerosoles.com, we use 
        Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, 
        including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. 
        SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. 
        Making a credit card purchase online at Aerosoles.com is just as safe 
        as making a credit card purchase over the telephone. But if you would 
        prefer to use the phone, just call 800-798-9478, and one of our customer 
        service associates will gladly take your order—24 hours a day, seven 
        days a week. </font></font></p>
