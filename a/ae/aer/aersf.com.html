Even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Email and Telephone Communications</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. We will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. Note that you will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested. We may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding Aer and our Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy).</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We maintain telephone “do-not-call” and “do-not-mail” lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do-not-mail, do-not-phone and do-not-contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Human Resources Data</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">With regard to Personal Information that Aer receives in connection with the employment relationship, Aer will use such Personal Information only for employment-related purposes as more fully described above. If Aer intends to use this Personal Information for any other purpose, Aer will notify the Individual and provide an opportunity to opt-out of such uses.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“Do Not Track”</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and www.aboutads.info/choices/. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You may inquire as to whether Aer is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an email to support@aersf.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Aer.

If Aer determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Aer will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Data Retention</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Aer retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p><h2 style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Security of Your Information</h2><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you use the Services after the updated Privacy Policy is posted on the Services.
