                                        your permission to allow us to post publicly 
                                        some of your information on the Site, 
                                        such as on a winners page, in the event 
                                        you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except 
                                        as required by applicable law, we will 
                                        not post your information without your 
                                        permission. In some instances, a third 
                                        party advertiser or sponsor may operate 
                                        or host a contest or sweepstakes on the 
                                        Site, and collect your information. In

                                        or host of the contest or sweepstakes, 
                                        we have no control over the information 
                                        collected and accordingly urge you to 
                                        review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy 
                                        policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes

                                        As with many Websites, the Site uses standard 
                                        technology called "cookies," 
                                        which are small data files that are transferred 
                                        to your computer when you allow your browser 
                                        to accept cookies. Cookies automatically 
                                        identify your Web browser to the Site 
                                        whenever you visit the Site, and make

                                        By tracking how and when you use the Site, 
                                        cookies help us determine which areas 
                                        are popular and which are not. Many improvements 
                                        and updates to the Site are based on data 
                                        obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies 
                                        allows you, among other things, to personalize

                                        We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream

                                        and to report aggregate information to 
                                        our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address 
                                        is a number that is automatically assigned

                                        Web pages from the Site, our computers

                                        served, the time, the source of the request, 
                                        the type of browser making the request,

                                        non-personal information. When analyzed, 
                                        this data helps us analyze how visitors 
                                        arrive at the Site, what type of content

                                        in the aggregate are interested in particular 
                                        kinds of content and advertising, and

                                      information about our customers to improve 
                                      our marketing and promotional efforts, to 
                                      statistically analyze site usage, to improve 
                                      our content and product offerings and to 
                                      customize our site's content and layout.

                                    <p>What choices do I have about AEG collecting, 
                                      using, and sharing my information<br>
                                      It is possible for you to use much of our 
                                      site without giving us any personally identifiable 
                                      information. When you do register with us 
                                      or give us personally identifiable information, 
                                      you will have an opportunity at the time 
                                      we collect your information -- to limit 
                                      e-mail communications from AEG and from 
                                      our third-party partners. You can request 
                                      at any time that AEG not send future e-mail 
                                      to you either by unsubscribing from the 
                                      communication or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:internetpolicy@aeg-la.com" class="titleLink">internetpolicy@aeg-la.com</a>. 
                                      Also, as mentioned above, there are ways 
                                      to limit the information collected through 
                                      technology -- though some of our features 
                                      won't work if you decide to do this.</p>
                                    <p>What security precautions are in place 
                                      to protect against the loss, misuse, or 
                                      alteration of your information<br>
                                      We use industry standard efforts to safeguard 
                                      the confidentiality of your personally identifiable 
                                      information. However, please keep in mind 
                                      that "perfect security" does not 
                                      exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide 
                                      Web.</p>
                                    <p>Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards<br>
                                      The Site may make chat rooms, forums and 
                                      message boards available to its users. You 
                                      are not required to provide any personal 
                                      information when using these areas but you 
                                      may choose to do so. If you post personal 
                                      information online, it will be publicly 
                                      available and you may receive unsolicited 
                                      messages from other parties. AEG cannot 
                                      ensure the security of any information you 
                                      choose to make public in a chat room, forum, 
                                      or message board. Also, we cannot ensure 
                                      that parties who have access to such publicly 
                                      available information will respect your 
                                      privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding 
                                      to disclose personal information in these 
                                      areas.</p>
                                    <p>Links to other Websites<br>
                                      You should be aware that when you are on 
                                      the Site you could be directed to other 
                                      sites beyond our control. For example, if 
                                      you "click" on a banner advertisement, 
                                      the "click" may take you off the 
                                      Site onto a different Website. This includes 
                                      links from advertisers, sponsors and partners 
                                      that may use the Site's logo as part of 
                                      a co-branding agreement. These other Websites 
                                      may send their own cookies to you, independently 
                                      collect data or solicit personal information 
                                      and may or may not have their own published 
                                      privacy policies. If you visit a Website 
                                      that is linked to our Site, you should consult 
                                      that site's privacy policy before providing 
                                      any personal information.</p>
                                    <p>A special note for parents concerning privacy<br>
                                      We do not encourage children to participate

                                      of age and under) do not submit any personal

                                      the age of 13 years, please use our services
