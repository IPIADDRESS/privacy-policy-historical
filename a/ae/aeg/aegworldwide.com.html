<h4>Personalization, marketing and advertising.</h4>

<p>Entertainment is personal, and we are always working to help you find the best concerts, festivals, sports, and other events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers’ preferences, and better recommend products and services that are personalized to our prior customers, we may link together personal data processed for the following purposes:</p>

<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">when you make a purchase or other transaction through our Service;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">when you attend our Events and Venues;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">when you access and use our online Services; and</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">when you enter a contest or other promotion.</li>
</ul><p>We use this information for our legitimate interests in:</p>

<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">personalizing&nbsp;the Services and future offers you see;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">creating&nbsp;aggregate data; and</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">marketing communications.</li>
</ul><p>We may also process this personal data for&nbsp;targeted advertising. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising only with appropriate consent.</p>

<h4>aggregated data</h4>

<p>We will collect and aggregate on an anonymous basis information about you, your spending and use of our Services with information about other users of the Services in order to identify trends (“<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>”). We may pass Aggregated Data to the third parties referred to in the section below to give them a better understanding of our business and to bring you a better service. Aggregated Data will not contain information from which you may be personally identified.</p>

<h4>marketing communications</h4>

<p>Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our&nbsp;<u>third party</u>&nbsp;partners) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with, or submission of User Content to, us. These communications may be&nbsp;<u>personalized</u>&nbsp;or customized based on your user profile. Similarly, we may also collect device data and contact data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate preferences data based on these interactions.</p>

<h4>personalization and profiling</h4>

<p>We&nbsp;or other companies in Our Group will combine any personal data about you that we receive from you, from other companies in Our Group, and from third-parties in order to create marketing profiles.</p>

<p>Marketing profiles include personal data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, information about when you have visited our Events and Venues in the past and which parts of the building you visited or events you attended, demographic data and data from your social media profiles.</p>

<p>For example, we may analyze the personal data of people who have purchased tickets for a particular future event that we promote, operate, provide services for, or that is hosted at one of our Events and Venues, and then compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in our database who have similar personal data to the original purchasers, we may then target marketing about that event to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending direct marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.</p>

<h4>targeted advertising</h4>

<p>Our Group, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.</p>

<p>The parties that control the processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from&nbsp;personalization and profiling. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.</p>

<p>We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).</p>

<h4>sharing your personal data</h4>

<p>In order to streamline certain business operations, improve Service personalization and behavioral marketing<u>,</u>&nbsp;develop products and services that better meet the interests and needs of our customers, and promote information we believe will be of interest to you, we will share your personal data with other companies in Our Group, as well as any other current or future affiliated entities, subsidiaries, and parent companies of AEG.</p>

<p>In connection with our general business operations, product/service improvements, to enable certain features, and in connection with our other legitimate business interests, we may share your personal data with service providers who provide certain services or process data on our behalf.</p>

<p>In order to improve personalization, deliver more relevant advertisements, and develop better products and services, we may share certain personal data with current or future affiliated entities and trusted third parties for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes, and we may allow third parties (such as Facebook and social media advertisers, ad exchanges, data management platforms, or ad servers) to operate on our Services and process data for behavioral advertising.</p>

<p>Where allowed by law, or with your consent, we will share your personal data with other trusted third parties, for example the artists, promoters or sponsors we work with. In certain cases, these parties may use your personal data for marketing or promotional purposes by sending you information about related products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>If you use any social media plugin, API, or other similar feature, use an event hashtag or similar link, or otherwise interact with us or our Services via social media, we may make your post available on our Services or to the general public. We may share, rebroadcast, or redisplay personal data or other information in the post to the extent permitted by the relevant social media service.</p>

<p><strong>We will also disclose your personal data to third parties in the following circumstances:</strong></p>

<ul><li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or</li>
	<li data-gc-list-depth="1" data-gc-list-style="bullet">to protect the rights, property, or safety of Our Group, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal data with other organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul><h3>international transfers of your personal data</h3>

<p>If you are located outside the US, your personal data may be transferred to and/or processed in a location outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

<p>In particular, your personal data may also be processed by staff operating in the United States or outside the EEA working for us, other members of Our Group or third-party data processors. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of our Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services.</p>

<p>Some countries outside Europe do not have laws that protect your privacy rights as extensively as those in Europe. However, if we do transfer your personal data to other territories, we will put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data are properly protected and processed only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Those safeguards include imposing contractual obligations of adequacy or requiring the recipient to subscribe to or be certified with an ‘international framework’ of protection. You can obtain more information about the safeguards we put in place by&nbsp;<u>contacting us</u>&nbsp;using the information below.</p>

<h3>how long do we keep your personal data?</h3>

<p>We retain information for so long as it, in our discretion, remains relevant to its purpose, and in any event, for so long as is required by law. We will review retention periods periodically, and may sometimes pseudonymize or anonymize data held for longer periods, if appropriate.</p>

<p>However, in some circumstances, we will retain your personal data for a shorter period, such as CCTV footage, which will be retained as required by law. Similarly, we will retain your personal data for longer if we believe we may need them in order to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, and we will retain your personal data for longer if we are required to retain them in order to comply with applicable laws.</p>

<p>We will always retain your personal data in accordance with data protection law and never retain your personal data for longer than is necessary.</p>
