<h2>General Overview</h2>
<p>This Site is one of several sites relating to and/or operated by the sports and live entertainment venues and properties owned and/or operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates ("AEG" or "we").  The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you.  Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Site Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>AEG is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process and complete the commercial transactions you request that can be completed on this Site, and to provide you with a more personalized experience on our Site. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of all of our customers and visitors. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online. For some services, we collect and transfer personal information to a service provider.  For some services, such as ticket sales, we act as a service provider for our clients -- the venues.  We encourage you to review the venue's privacy policy before purchasing tickets on this site.  Or, as a result of visiting our site you may visit or click-through to other merchants (e.g. unaffiliated ticket sites) through links on our site who may collect and use your personal information in ways that are different than how we utilize your information.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these sites before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>

<p><strong><a name="typeinfo"></a>Types of information that may be collected</strong></p>
<p>The personally-identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate the purchase and delivery of tickets and/or other products and/or services to our customers. In the process of providing these tickets, products and/or services, we require our customers to provide certain personally-identifiable information. Specific details may include, but is not limited to the following and may be subject to change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case of contests, promotions, and/or newsletter registrations or other features that may or may not involve a purchase, we may require users and/or customers wishing to participate in any of our contests, drawings, sweepstakes, promotions, newsletters, fantasy games, webcasts or other interactive features which may or may not involve a purchase to complete an entry or similar form which will require the submission of certain personally-identifiable information.</li>
  <li>The  personally-identifiable information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, customer's first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personally-identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone number.  If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature's terms of use.</li>
  <li>In the case of a ticket or other product and/or service which involves a purchase which is completed on the Site, in order to complete the purchase of a ticket, a product and/or service, an online credit card transaction is required. During this process we generate and collect certain   personally-identifiable information.</li>
  <li>The personally-identifiable information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket,  product and/or service purchase, includes, but may not be limited to: customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address.   You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase. If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="howcollected"></a>How is information collected?</strong></p>
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Registration</strong><br>
		If you register for a service you will be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally-identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, forums, fantasy games, webcasts, or other subscription based services.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Newsletters, Site Emails, Mobile Offers</strong><br>
		We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or in the designated area of the newsletters or emails or as specified in a mobile communication.  Remember, if you consent to receive texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts.  Please check with your wireless carrier for details.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Contests or Sweepstakes</strong><br>
		We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require registration in order to enter.  Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.  Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes.  In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the Sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Surveys or Voting</strong><br>
		From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.

	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</strong><br>
		We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Site.

<p>We internally use personally-identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Site and provide better service to our customers.</p>
<p>We may use a customer's email address and mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices, issues with a transaction, satisfaction with the Site and/or our products and services and to provide further information regarding additional events, products and/or services in which we believe the customer would be interested.</p>
<p>We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>

<p><strong><a name="whomshared"></a>With whom the information may be disclosed.</strong></p>
<p>Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which the information was provided.</p>
<p>If you register with the Site, your information and information related to purchase you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us and our clients (the venues) for whom we are providing ticketing services to provide you with information or marketing communications we think you will be interested in.</p>
<p>In order to process your requests we may provide your personally-identifiable information to service providers or other companies who work on our behalf in order, for example, to process the transaction and deliver the tickets or other goods/services you have ordered.  When we do so, we use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. When we are acting as a service provider on behalf of a client (a venue), we provide your personally-identifiable information to the client for use, among other things, in connection with identification/verification of purchasers of tickets and event security.</p>
<p>In addition, in the event that we go through an existing or potential business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<p>We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or required by law, regulation, rule or court order pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us  to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.</p>
<p>Finally, if you choose to opt-in by checking off the appropriate box or otherwise notifying us,  your information may be provided (by us) to unaffiliated third parties for their use to contact you.  Otherwise we will not provide your information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If you do opt-in, at any time, you may withdraw your consent and tell us not to give your information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. If you want us to do so, please either email us or mail your written request to:</p>

<p>AEG<br>
800 W. Olympic Blvd, Suite 305<br>
Los Angeles, CA 90015<br>
Attn: Privacy Policy - AXS<br>

<p>Remember, when we sell tickets, we do so as a service provider for the venues.  We do not  control the privacy practices of venues.  If you wish to confirm the venue's privacy practices please review the venue's privacy policy or contact the venue.</p>

<p><strong><a name="choices"></a>What choices do I have about AEG collecting, using, and sharing my information?</strong></p>
<p>It is possible for you to use much of the Site without giving us any personally-identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally-identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information -- to limit e-mail communications from us or opt-in to receive e-mails from third parties. You can request at any time that any of the AEG affiliated companies not send future e-mails to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com">unsubscribe@axs.com</a></p>
<p>We reserve the right to  disclose  personally-identifiable information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AEG or its employees, Site users, performers, athletes,  or the public. Information collected through this Site, including personally-identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.</p>

<p><strong><a name="security"></a>What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable security measures to safeguard  the personally-identifiable information you provide to us.   However, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web.</p>

<p><strong><a name="chat"></a>Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards</strong></p>
<p>The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. We strongly recommend that you DO NOT use your personal information as your user name and DO NOT post any personally-identifiable information on line, since such information will be publicly available.  We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.</p>

<p><strong><a name="links"></a>Links to other Websites</strong></p>
