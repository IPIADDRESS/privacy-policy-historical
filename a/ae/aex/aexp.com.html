    <p><a name="SECURITY"><b>Security</b> </a></p>
    <p>When you send confidential personal account data to us on an American Express website,
    we require that a "secure session" first be established using Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL), or Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol when that is fully available.
    For further information about SSL, SET and the safety and confidentiality of personal data
    transmissions over the Internet, please read our <a href="/cust_serv/docs/cs_security.shtml">Security Q&amp;A.</a> </p>
    <p><a name="INFOCOLLECT"><b>Information Collection</b> </a></p>
    <p>When you <b>browse</b> any American Express website, you do so anonymously. Personal
    information -- including your E-mail address -- is <em>not</em> collected. Some of our
    websites, however, may request that you <b>voluntarily</b> supply us with personal
    information, including your E-mail address and account number (if you are an American
    Express Cardmember or InvestDirect user), for purposes such as correspondence, site
    registration, checking your bill or investments online, making a purchase, or
    participating in online surveys. </p>
    <p>Like many other commercial websites, the American Express website may utilize a
    standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site
    is used. Please read <a href="/corp/consumerinfo/privacy/about_cookies.asp">About Cookies</a>
    for more information. </p>
    <p><a name="INFOUSE"><b>Information Use</b> </a></p>
    <p>If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may upon
    occasion send you E-mail offers. We may use information you have given us to, for example,
    provide a service, ensure proper billing, measure consumer interest in our various
    services and inform you about products and services. These offers may be based on
    information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information
    that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available
    from external sources, such as census bureau data. Primarily, these E-mail offers will
    come from American Express. We may also, upon occasion, share E-mail addresses with
    certain establishments that accept the American Express Card, or with other
    well-established companies so that they can send you product and service offers that may
    be of interest. </p>
    <p>All offers are carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards. Our goal is
    to target offers to people who we believe will find them of value. The lists used to send
    you product and service offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed
    to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information. For an
    illustration of the types of offers we may provide with our business partners exclusively
    to American Express Cardmembers, please view <a href="http://www6.americanexpress.com/specialoffers/">American Express Special Offers</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that our free E-mail service, <a href="http://www.amexmail.com">AmExMail</a>,
    as well as our financial services websites, <a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/advisors">American Express Financial Advisors</a> and
    <a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/direct">American Express Financial Direct</a>, <em>do
    not</em> share E-mail addresses with any company outside of American Express. </p>
    <p><a name="EMAILOFFERS"><b>Declining E-mail Offers</b> </a></p>
    <p>American Express provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail
    offers. </p>
    <p>Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully
    designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any
    time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to
    the E-mail and informing us of your preferences. All E-mail offers that you receive from
    American Express will inform you of how to decline receiving further E-mail offers.
    Additionally, you may <a href="/cust_serv/privacy/default.asp">set E-mail preferences</a>
    to notify us of your preferences regarding the type of E-mail offers you do not want to
    receive, and you may also review and change preferences you have previously set. </p>

<p><a name="WALLET"><b>Online Wallet</b></a></p>
   <p> The American Express Online Wallet offers features to facilitate your
online shopping experience, and we would like you to be aware of how we protect
the information the Wallet stores and uses.

</p><p>When you register for an American Express Online Wallet, we request that you
supply us with information necessary to complete your online purchases. This
information includes your name, telephone number, billing address, E-mail
address, and the account number and expiration date of the credit cards you
choose to place in the Wallet.  You may also voluntarily store additional names
and addresses in your Wallet so that you can have online purchases easily
shipped to destinations other than your billing address. We will not use these
additional names for any marketing purpose and we will not share them.

</p><p>The Wallet allows you to store your user id and password information for
those Wallet-compatible sites that require it, to provide you with one-click
entry into these sites.  The user ids and passwords you store in the Wallet are
provided only to the web site for which the information is required and are not
disclosed by us to any other party.

</p><p>Security is an important feature of the Wallet.  All of the information you
provide to us in connection with the Wallet is stored on an American Express
secure server and protected by firewalls.  American Express will not access
individual information stored in a wallet which relates to non-American Express
Card transactions.

</p><p>From time to time American Express may use information you have provided to
us as well as American Express purchase information to develop customized offers
 you may find of interest. We provide you with the ability to
<a href="/cust_serv/privacy/default.asp">set E-mail preferences</a> should you
wish to decline receiving E-mail offers.

</p><p>In order to make your Wallet easy to retrieve and use, a software program is
installed on your computer when you sign up for a Wallet.  This program stores a
 list of merchant sites that are compatible with the Wallet in a file on your
computer's hard drive.  As you browse, this program  automatically compares the
addresses (URLs) of the sites you visit against this list of compatible merchant
 sites. When you visit a merchant site at which you may use the Wallet, your
screen will display a prompt advising you that the Wallet is available for use.
If you visit a site which has not been previously identified as
Wallet-compatible, the Wallet will request an update from the American Express
Wallet server as to whether or not the site now accepts the Wallet and store
updated information about that site in the hard drive of your computer.
American Express cannot access this information and we cannot link your
identity with the URL information that this program updates as you browse.

</p><p>When you indicate your wish to complete a purchase from an online merchant
using the Wallet, your selected payment and shipping information is transmitted
securely to the merchant using the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protocol.  Using the Wallet in connection with Blue from American Express
provides an additional level of security by using the Smart Chip in combination
with a Smart Card Reader and Personal Identification Number (PIN) code.

</p><p>The Wallet collects and stores securely a record of all purchases that you
make using your wallet, including the date and amount of purchase, the merchant
at which the purchase was made, and the credit card and account number used.
Along with this summary of transactions, you will also be able to view purchase
receipts if this capability is made available by the merchant.

</p><p>When you use the Wallet, your purchase information may be recorded by the
merchant as well as the issuer of the card you used to make the purchase.
Therefore we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the merchant's and the
 card issuer's privacy policies, which may differ from those of American Express.
