      <p><b> <a name="1"></a>AES’ Commitment To Privacy Protection For Users Of 
        Its Website</b></p>
      <p>American Education Services (AES), a division of the Pennsylvania Higher 
        Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA)<sup>1</sup>, is committed to preserving 
        the individual privacy rights of all of the users of its websites. AES 
        strongly believes that it has a responsibility to protect from disclosure 
        to unauthorized parties the personally identifying information (name, 
        address, date of birth, social security number, etc.) of its website users. 
        Therefore, AES has adopted and implemented a privacy policy to protect 
        the individually identifying account and personal information of its website 
        users.</p>
      <p><a href="#b">Return to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
      <p><b>Notice And Disclosure<a name="2"></a></b></p>
      <p><b>AES will not sell, trade, nor disclose the personally identifying 
        information of its website users to any unauthorized third parties.</b> 
        Because of the many different relationships PHEAA/AES has with the users 
        of its websites<sup>2</sup>, it is possible that disclosure of information 
        provided by website users might be required in the delivery of AES’ services 
        to users in the following circumstances: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> When users have authorized the disclosure of information through 
          certifications on loan applications and promissory notes, the Free Application 
          for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and documents held by AES and its partners 
          such as schools, lenders, servicers, United States Department of Education, 
          and guarantors of users’ financial aid. </li>
        <p> 
        </p><li> When AES needs to share user information to provide services a user 
          has requested.</li>
        <p> 
        </p><li> When AES needs to provide the information to its business partners 
          that perform services for users.</li>
        <p> 
        </p><li>When AES is required by law to disclose user information by order 
          of court, pursuant to state, local, federal, or international statute, 
          regulation or mandate, and in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.</li>
      </ol>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Additionally, AES may use information provided by users 
        for the following internal purposes: providing services to users, complying 
        with local, state, or federal financial aid statutes and regulations, 
        ensuring accurate contact and billing information for users, and analyzing 
        the efficiency of its websites.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Under AES administration of the Federal Family Education 
        Loan Program (FFELP), AES requires the disclosure of Social Security numbers 
        by applicants for loans under FFELP. The primary use of this information 
        is to verify user identity, to determine user program eligibility and 
        benefits, to permit the servicing of user financial aid, to certify user 
        attendance and status at an approved higher educational institution, and 
        in the event necessary, to locate users. The disclosure of a user’s Social 
        Security number by a user is mandatory for the user to participate in 
        the FFELP.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The United States Department of Education has for several 
        years required the disclosure of individuals’ Social Security numbers 
        on applications and other FFELP requisite documents pursuant to published 
        regulations.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">AES uses "cookies" to enhance its website users' 
        experiences on the AES Website. A cookie is a small file that AES transfers 
        to users' computer hard drives. AES' use of cookies enables its website 
        users to avoid the nuisance of being asked to provide the same information 
        repeatedly while users move from page to page of the site. Cookies also 
        allow AES to ensure that only the user's web browser may exchange information 
        regarding the user's account with AES' servers. Most web browsers are 
        initially set to accept cookies. Additionally, some web browsers may be 
        set to prompt users before it accepts a cookie. Many of the services offered 
        on the AES Website might not function properly when users' set their web 
        browsers to reject cookies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Users should be aware that other websites to which a 
        user links from the AES website may contain privacy policies, statements, 
        promises, or provisions that differ from the AES Website Privacy Policy 
        and as such users are encouraged to review the applicable privacy policy 
        of any site other than the AES website. Users are encouraged to fully 
        review the privacy statements of other websites to determine whether or 
        not the user’s use of the site comports with the user’s desire to maintain 
        the privacy of his/her personally identifying information.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <b> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY">AES will not knowingly collect or retain information 
        submitted to it by children under the age of thirteen. If AES learns that 
        it unknowingly collected personally identifying information from children 
        under 13 years of age, it will immediately take all reasonable measures 
        to delete the information from its computer systems. </p>
      </b> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">AES will closely monitor and restrict its employees’ 
        access to user account and personal information to only instances of business 
        necessity.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="#b">Return to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
      <b><a name="3"></a>Choice and Consent</b> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY">AES provides users access on its website to users’ individual 
        account, eligibility for financial aid status, and much more personal 
        user level information. AES fully understands and wishes to fully serve 
        its website users that do not desire to have personally identifying account 
        and status information available on the AES website. Users may request 
        the deletion of their AES account information available to them on the 
        AES website by sending an email to <a href="mailto:slsccs@pheaa.org">slsccs@pheaa.org</a> 
        or call 1-800-233-0557 extension 4500. Upon receipt of an email from a 
        user, AES will remove the user’s account information from its website 
        but will continue to retain all of the information on its computer systems 
        as required by state and federal laws and regulations governing financial 
        aid. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Unless specifically notified by the user, AES will operate 
        as though the user consents to the user’s account information being available 
        on its websites. Please review the sections on data security and AES’ 
        privacy commitment for explanations of the security utilized by AES in 
        protecting personal account information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="#b">Return to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
      <p><b> <a name="4"></a>Data Quality and Access</b></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">AES will take all reasonable steps to assure that information 
        about users is accurate, complete, and timely for the purposes for which 
        it is intended to be used. AES will take every measure to establish appropriate 
        processes or mechanisms so that inaccuracies or errors in users’ information 
        may be timely corrected by the user. AES will try to make these processes 
        and mechanisms as simple and easy to use as possible while providing assurances 
        that the erroneous and inaccurate information has been timely corrected. 
        The information contained on the AES website is subject to change without 
        prior advance notice. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When users browse the AES website and have not registered 
        as a user for any of AES’ online services, the browsing is anonymous. 
        Anonymous browsing includes reading pages and downloading certain information. 
        Personal information such as name, address, phone number, and email address 
        are not collected from anonymous browsers.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="#b">Return to Privacy Policy Menu</a></p>
      <p><b><u> </u><a name="5"></a>Data Security</b></p>
      <p>Securing users’ personal information is very important to AES. Therefore, 
        AES has implemented several security measures to protect users’ personally 
        identifying information from loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When users send confidential personal information to 
        AES via the AES website, AES requires that a secure session first be established 
        using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. During a secure SSL session, 
        data passed back and forth between the user’s computer and AES’ servers 
        is secured through the use of public key cryptography. The user’s computer 
        exchanges key information with AES computers to create a private conversation 
        that only the user’s computer and AES systems may understand. To benefit 
        from SSL technology, users must use a browser with SSL capabilities. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Please note that while using the AES website, users will 
        be notified when entering a secure session and when leaving a secure session, 
        unless the setting is turned off on the user's browser. After leaving 
        a secure session any information transmitted to AES is not secure. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">For security purposes, AES uses special software programs 
        to monitor traffic on its website and to identify unauthorized attempts 
        to upload or change information, or otherwise to cause damage to the AES 
        website. These programs do not collect personally identifying information 
        about you but they do collect information that will enable AES to identify 
        someone attempting to tamper with its website. AES has a zero tolerance 
        policy for the misuse, misappropriation, unauthorized access, tampering, 
        damage, destruction, or unlawful utilization of its websites and computer 
        systems and will seek the maximum enforcement of state, federal, and international 
        criminal laws against any individual engaging in such activity. Additionally, 
        AES will seek the maximum amount of civil damages available under the 
        law in such instances of the unauthorized misuse of its websites and computer 
        systems. </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Please note that when a user sends electronic mail messages 
        (e-mail) to AES, the user’s message will usually contain the user’s return 
        email address. Thus, AES may utilize a user’s e-mail address in responding 
        to a user’s inquiry and the content of the user’s e-mail in formulating 
        a response. AES will permanently record and store any substantive e-mail 
        received from users. E-mail is not a secure means of transmitting information.
