<span class="sublabel">MISCELLANEOUS</span><br>

<span class="sublabel">What is the Policy with Respect to Gathering Information from and Communicating with Children Online?</span>

<p>We recognize the unique privacy concerns regarding children.  Pursuant to COPPA guidelines, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13.  If a parent or guardian is made aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, please contact us at 1-866-338-2389, by e-mail at custserv@ae.com, or at the address listed above, and we will remove the information about the individual from our marketing database. </p>

<span class="sublabel">Our Commitment to Data Security</span>

<p>AE makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information collected from you is protected against loss and unauthorized access.  This protection applies in relation to information stored in both electronic and hard copy form.  AE uses industry standard security techniques on our websites to help protect against the loss, misuse or modification of information that you have provided.  When you access your personal information or transmit personally identifiable data to us, that information is stored on servers that we have used commercially reasonable efforts to protect from unauthorized access or intrusion. While we implement the above security measures, you should be aware that 100% security is not possible. </p>

<span class="sublabel">What happens if I hit a link to another site from an AE site?</span>

<p>Our websites may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own terms of use and privacy and security policies. AE is not responsible for how such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information.  If you choose to visit one of these sites, you may want to review the policies that govern that particular site.</p>

If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2005 will receive information regarding 2004 sharing activities).</p>

<p>To obtain this information, please send an email message to custserv@ae.com with "Request for California Privacy Information" on the subject line and in the body of your message.
