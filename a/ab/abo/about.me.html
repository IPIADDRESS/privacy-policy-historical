You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find about.me users you know.

			<p>Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy policy.</p>

			<p>Business Transfers: In the event that about.me is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
			<p>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public bio or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>
			<h3>Modifying Your Personal Information</h3>
