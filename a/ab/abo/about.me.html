				<p class="text small">Effective date: February 4, 2013</p>
				<p>Welcome to Pumpkinhead, Inc. (“Pumpkinhead, Inc.,” “we,” “us” or “our”).  This Privacy Policy describes Pumpkinhead, Inc.’s policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information in connection with Pumpkinhead, Inc.  services (collectively, the “Service” or “about.me”).</p>
				<p>When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used by about.me in the United States or any other country where about.me operates. </p>
				<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacyquestions@about.me">privacyquestions@about.me</a>.</p>
				<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>We collect and use your information to provide our Services and improve them over time.</p>
				<p>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure an about.me account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, may be listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.</p>
				<p>Additional Information: You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, education, work, contact information or a picture. You may customize your account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find about.me users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
				<p>Location Information: You may choose to note your location in your on your about.me profile. </p>
				<p>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements, may also be included in Log Data. </p>
				<p>Links: about.me may keep track of how you interact with links by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on. </p>
				<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. about.me may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. </p>
				<p>Device Identifiers: When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.”&nbsp;A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by about.me.</p>
				<p>Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of user content was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their user content including tags, location, work, education and other Metadata.  This makes your user content more searchable by others and more interactive.</p>
				<p>Third Party Services: about.me uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our Services, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP request.</p>

If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access your content you do so at your own risk.</p>
				<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
				<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http:/about.me/privacy.&nbsp; If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an about.me update or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
