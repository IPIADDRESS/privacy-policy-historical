<div style="padding: 0 30px 30px 30px;">

<p>ICM Registry LLC (“ICM”) understands how important privacy is to you and to members of our Sponsored Community. This policy explains 
how we process information that identifies you personally (“Personal Information”), when you:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: inside; margin-left: 60px;">
	<li>visit websites operated by ICM (“Registry Websites”);</li>
	<li>apply for Membership within the .XXX TLD; or</li>
    <li>register for or reserve .XXX Domain Names.</li>
</ul>

<p>This policy applies only to Personal Information that ICM collects from and about you. It does not apply to information collected by domain name registrars 
or third parties when you apply to register or reserve a .XXX name with them nor does it apply to information collected on third party sites that you may access 
via a link on Registry Websites.</p>

<p>By using Registry Websites or services, including by registering or reserving a .XXX domain name, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and transfer 
of your Personal Information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.  You consent to the collection, use, processing, and/or disclosure of Personal Information 
in the United States.  If you are visiting the Registry Website from a country other than the country in which the Registry servers are located, your communications 
with the Registry may result in the transfer of information (including your membership account information) across international boundaries; you consent to such 
transfer.</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Collection, Use, &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information</p>

<p><em>Information you Provide on Registry Websites:</em></p>
<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><p>We collect Personal Information that you directly provide on any Registry Websites, for example, when you submit a question or comment, 
register to receive updates from ICM, use the pre-reservation services, or submit proposed names for the Culturally Significant Names Reserved List. Depending on the 
service, we may ask for your name, affiliation, job title, status (i.e., Sponsored Community membership, etc.) email address, country, URLs you operate, and .XXX names 
you would like to register or reserve.  We also collect information that you post on public forums or in chat rooms on Registry Websites. If you are applying to become 
a registrar for the .XXX TLD, we collect additional data via the Request for Information (“RFI”) form. We may supplement the Personal Information you provide 
with demographic data from third parties. It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to provide Personal Information on any Registry Website. If you disagree with 
this Policy, please do not submit Personal Information on Registry Websites.</p></div>

<p><em>Information Collected Automatically on Registry Websites:</em></p>
 
<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><p>When you visit Registry Websites, our servers automatically log certain information including: the type of browser you are using (e.g., 
Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), CPU type (e.g. Pentium), the way you access the Internet (e.g., 
connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); IP address; other information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider. 
Our servers also log header information forwarded by the Internet site you navigated from to reach any Registry Websites. Please note that ICM does not control the information 
included in the header by a referring website, which may include search terms and other information about your activities on that site. Our servers also log information about 
your activity on Registry Websites, including the time and date of your visits, the pages you view on any Registry Website, your responses to offerings and advertisements 
(if any) presented on the Registry Websites, and the searches you perform, including any WHOIS searches.</p>

<p>Unless you have provided Personal Information directly, for example by registering for updates, ICM cannot and does not attempt to use log data to identify you 
personally.</p></div>

<p><em>Use of Personal Information Collected on Registry Websites:</em></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><p>ICM uses Personal Information collected on all Registry Websites to operate and improve those Registry Websites, to fulfill your requests 
and respond to your inquiries, to understand how you use the Registry Websites, and to personalize the content and advertisements you see on those Registry Websites.</p></div>

<p class="sectiontitle">Collection, Use, &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information from Domain Name Registrants/Reservants</p>

<p>ICM collects Personal Information when you apply for Membership in the Sponsored Community as well as when you apply to register or reserve a .XXX domain name.</p>

<p><em>Information Collected in Connection with Domain Name Registrations/Reservations</em></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><a name="Membership"><p style="text-decoration: underline;">Membership Information:</p></a>

<p>When you apply for membership in the .XXX Sponsored Community, we collect your full name, business affiliation, physical address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, 
password, and your credit card number, security code, and expiration date (collectively, “Membership Information”). This information is required even if you intend to 
use an ICM approved proxy service to register .XXX domain names. It is used to validate your contact information, to process your credit card payment (if any), ensure compliance 
with Registry Policies including policies related to consumer protection and security, and policies against child abuse images and related activities, and, in the event of a dispute, 
to confirm your eligibility for membership in the Sponsored Community. Once this process is complete, you will receive a “Membership Token,” which is your unique code. 
ICM may supplement Membership Information with data from third parties such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, directory services, and public records.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">IP Rights Information:</p>

<p>If you participate in any of the .XXX Sunrise programs, you will also be required to provide information about your registered trademark(s), which may include, depending upon which 
Sunrise service you use, the registered mark, registration number, country of registration, dates on which registration was applied for an granted, registration class, and information 
about other websites that you operate in an IANA-recognized top level domain (collectively, “IP Rights Information”). ICM uses this information to validate your eligibility 
to participate in the Sunrise program, whether as a member of the Sponsored Community or as a Trademark holder that is not a member of the Sponsored Community. This information is also 
used from time to time to confirm the continuing validity of a non-member’s Sunrise reservation. IP Rights Information is associated with your Sunrise application and, if you are a 
member of the Sponsored Community, your Membership Information, and your unique Membership Token.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Registration Information:</p>

<p>When you submit an application to register a .XXX domain name, your registrar will send us the domain name you would like to register or reserve, along with your name (or the name of 
an ICM approved proxy service), address, phone number, email address, names and contact information for your technical and administrative contacts (if different), expiration date, 
website hosting IP address, and website host name (collectively, “Registration Information”). Registration Information is included in the .XXX Whois database in accordance 
with ICANN policies and requirements. Registration Information is also associated with your unique Membership Token, your Membership Information, and your IP Rights Information 
(if any), even if you register using an ICM approved proxy service.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Monitoring Information:</p>

<p>In accordance with Registry Policies, all registered and resolving .XXX domain names may be scanned for viruses, malware, phishing activities, browser exploits, and other behaviors or 
code posing a security threat to any of (i) the websites; (ii) website users; or (iii) the .XXX TLD. In addition, all registered and resolving .XXX domain names may be scanned for content 
that suggests the presence of child abuse images or that is intended to appeal to pedophiles. Such monitoring may involve the incidental collection of Personal Information by our 
service providers.</p></div>

<p><em>Use of Information Collected for Domain Name Registrations/Reservations:</em></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><p>ICM Registry uses Membership Information, IP Rights Information, and Registration Information to process your application for membership in the 
Sponsored Community and to validate the contact information you provide, to process Sunrise applications, to register or reserve .XXX domain names, and to provide services (such as 
security and other scanning services) associated with operation of a website in the .XXX TLD. ICM also uses this information to operate its business in the ordinary course, improve 
our products and services, develop new products and services, and, if you are a member of the Sponsored Community, inform you about products and services that may be of 
interest to you.</p></div>

<p><em>Disclosure of Personal Information</em></p>

<div style="margin-left: 60px;"><p>ICM discloses Registration Information to the public in the form of Whois records, as required by ICANN. Note that if you use an ICM approved proxy 
service, the name of that service rather than your name will appear in the database. ICM may disclose other Personal Information or IP Rights Information to fulfill your requests 
for products and services, to respond to your inquiries, to third parties as necessary to deliver services associated with operating a website in the .XXX TLD (including without 
limitation to security scanning service providers) or in furtherance of our Sunrise policies including the auction rules, and to personalize the content and advertisements you see.</p>

<p>ICM does not share your Personal Information (including Personal Information collected on Registry Websites, Membership Information, IP Rights Information, and Registration Information) 
with third parties without your affirmative consent unless it is: (i) necessary to fulfill a transaction or provide information you have requested; (ii) as required by law or necessary 
to respond to legal process; (iii) in circumstances in which ICM believes that its Registry Websites or services, or that websites operating in the .XXX TLD, are being used in the commission 
of a crime; (iv) when ICM has a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person; or (v) as necessary to establish, assert, 
defend, or protect our rights or property.</p>

<p>ICM may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the Registry Websites, provide our product and service offerings, and to operate our business. You expressly consent to the 
sharing of your Personal Information with our agents, contractors and service providers under the premise that, if our agents and contractors have access to your Personal Information, 
they are contractually required to safeguard that information and prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p></div>

<p class="sectiontitle">Change of Ownership</p>

<p>If ICM’s ownership changes as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Personal Information may be transferred. If that transfer will result in a material 
change in the use of your Personal Information, ICM will notify you and give you the opportunity to decline to permit such a transfer.</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Cookies and Web Beacons</p>

<p>ICM may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies in combination with your Personal Information to enhance and personalize your experience on Registry Websites, including to 
operate and improve offerings through Registry Websites; to help authenticate you when you use Registry Websites; to remember your preferences and registration information; to enable a 
shopping cart; to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of ICM offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which ICM e-mails you open and act 
upon); and to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through Registry Websites.</p>

<p>ICM and its advertisers may also use ad network providers and other service providers to present customized content and advertisements on Registry Websites and other websites. These 
providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their content and advertisements, using data 
gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. ICM may share certain non-personally identifiable 
information about you (e.g., zip code) with certain ad network and service providers to help them deliver more relevant content and advertisements through their networks. The use of 
cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by content and ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ICM’s. To learn more about third party content and ad network 
providers and the choices you have about these technologies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative at 
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org.</a></p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Our Commitment to Security</p>

<p>ICM has implemented reasonable security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of the your Personal Information, but cannot guarantee that this information will 
never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or ICM policies).</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Special Note for Parents</p>

<p>Registry Websites are intended for adults. Children under the age of eighteen are not permitted to register for or use Registry Websites, products, and services. We do not knowingly 
collect information from children under eighteen.</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">How to Contact Us</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about ICM's Privacy Policy, or if you are unable to access and/or correct your Personal Information online, you may contact us via email sent to 
<a href="mailto:privacyATicmregistry.com">ICM Registry</a>.</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>ICM may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will provide appropriate online notice of any significant changes. You may be provided other privacy-related information in 
connection with your use of specific ICM offerings, special features and services not described in this Policy, or products and services that may be introduced in the future.</p>

<p class="sectiontitle">Your California Privacy Rights</p>

<p>California privacy law allows California residents to obtain specific disclosures about a business's privacy practices if it shares information with other companies for direct marketing 
purposes. To make a request to the ICM under California's privacy law, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:privacyATicmregistry.com">ICM Registry</a>.</p>
