	<dd>We use the information, including analytics and statistical information, to analyze the use of the Services so that we may improve them. We also use this information to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our user base.</dd>
	<dt><b>Customizing Your Experience</b></dt>
	<dd>We use the information that we collect to allow advertising to be targeted to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent. We may also use this information to customize certain features of the Services to provide you with an enhanced experience based on information such as the type of device you are using to access the Services, your activities on the services, or your location or geo-location.  We may also use this information to provide you with services you have requested.</dd>
	<dt><b>Service Providers</b></dt>
	<dd>We may contract with other companies that provide services to us, including credit-card and billing processors, survey administrators, technical or customer support, shipping, e-mail distribution, email service providers, data enhancement and information or analytics providers, list processing and promotions management. Sometimes, we may provide to these service providers aggregate or anonymized information about how users interact with our Services (or other information provided to us by users), which may help them enhance their own products, data or analytics.</dd>
	<dt><b>Our Parent Company</b></dt>
	<dd>About, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC and an operating company of Ask.com. We share information we collect with our affiliates (entities that are under common ownership or control)  to better understand our users (their demographics, what they do on our Websites, what Website features they like, how they use them, etc.), to serve ads on other IAC websites, and to improve the content and answers delivered on the Services and on affiliate services, such as Ask.com's services.</dd>	
	
	<h2 class="h2">Communication with Guides, Experts and other Contributors to the Services</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The Services feature content provided by people who are independent contractors and not employees of About, including content provided by contributors including those we call "Experts" or "Guides." If you contact an Expert or Guide (or other contributor) directly by email through the Services (including via an about.com or aboutguide.com email domain) or otherwise then that communication is independent of the Services, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. Although About contractually requires its Expert and Guide contributors to maintain information from About users in confidence, About cannot and does not guarantee that they will do so, and is not responsible for what our contributors  may say, or how they may use information you have freely provided to them.  Likewise, your communications with a contributor are not private or confidential, nor are such communications protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege. For more information see our <a href="http://www.about.com/gi/pages/ethics.htm">Ethics Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.about.com/gi/pages/uagree.htm">User Agreement</a>.</li>

	<h1 id="adchoices"><a name="Information-Collected-by-Third-Parties-and-Your-Ad-Choices" style="text-decoration: none;">Information Collected by Third-Parties and Your Ad &amp; Cookie Choices</a></h1>
	<p>Third parties may collect information about you through the Services, including through use of the technologies for serving relevant ads and other reasons as described above. We may not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' data collection practices and we do not assume any liability related to their collection or use. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Websites. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content on the Websites or on any other websites on the Internet.</p>
	<p>For instance, like many other websites and applications, in addition to our own systems, we may use DoubleClick, DoubleClick Mobile, Google, Google AdMob, nRelate (which is an affiliate of About, Inc.), PubMatic, 24/7 Connect, Krux, and other third-party Ad Servers, analytics platforms and data management platforms to serve and display Advertisements, or to collect information about you and your use of the Services for other analytics purposes. They may use cookies, pixel trackers, web beacons or other internet or mobile technology to collect non-personal and/or anonymous information about your use of the Services (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) and precise geolocation and user device identification (if you have provided your consent for such collection) during and about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.  In certain cases, you have options and choices about the collection and use of information by third parties on our Websites:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For more information about these third-party Ad Networks and opting out of tracking through the NAI, see: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</li>
		<li>For more information about interest-based advertising and opting out through the DAA, see: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li>
		<li>For more information about disabling and controlling third-party cookies in your browser, see: <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1">http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1</a></li>
		<li>For more information on nRelate and opting out of browser history tracking, see: <a href="http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/">http://nrelate.com/privacy-policy/</a></li>
		<li>For more information on PubMatic and opting out of PubMatic's cookie usage, please visit: <a href="http://pubmatic.com/opt-out">http://pubmatic.com/opt-out</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to the above, we have implemented on our Services certain "Google Analytics" features that support Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Visitors to our Websites may opt out of Google Analytics, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/">Google Ad Preferences Manager</a> and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/?hl=en">Customer Ads Help Center</a>. If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a>.</p> 
	
	<h2 class="h2">Other Privacy Considerations</h2>
	<p>We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a transfer or all or part of our business or assets (e.g., a sale, merger, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization) or are taking steps in anticipation of such a transaction (e.g., participating in due diligence).</p>
	
	<dt>Do Not Track Browser Disclosure</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
		<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the DAA opt-out link <a href="#Information-Collected-by-Third-Parties-and-Your-Ad-Choices">above</a>. However, <b>we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals</b>, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Information from Children Under 13</dt>
	<dd>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we determine that a user is under 13, we will delete all personally identifiable information collected from that user.</dd>
	<dt>Information from Users Outside of the United States</dt>
	<dd>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this privacy policy, and acknowledge that data protection laws in the U.S. may be different or less restrictive than in some other countries.</dd>
	<dt>Your California Privacy Rights</dt>
	<dd>
	Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of the  disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes (as those concepts are defined in that law) However, we do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law.</dd>
	<dt>Compliance With Legal Process</dt>
	<dd>We may disclose personal information (1) if we believe such sharing is appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process; (2) to protect and defend our rights, services or property; (3) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Services; or (4) to protect the safety or property of our users or any member of the public (among other things, this means that if we believe you have provided false information or attempted to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).</dd>
