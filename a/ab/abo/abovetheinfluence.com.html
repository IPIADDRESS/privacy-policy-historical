						  your privacy very seriously. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and the online privacy guidelines of the 
						  White House Office of Management and Budget, we do not sell, share or rent any personally identifying information about you.</p>
							
							<p><strong>COPPA</strong> <br>

							Online Privacy  Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Information You Submit</strong><br>
							The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. If you  want to send us your comments, you will be asked to enter 
							a nickname or handle. </p>
							
							<p>If you choose to submit a request to the "Contact Us" submission page, we will request your  e-mail address only for the purpose of

							<p><strong>I.</strong> In order to submit a Creative Submission, we require following information: <br>
							Screen Name  (which is a nickname, NOT your legal name) <br>
							* If you  are an AOL user, please be sure to alter the screen name you submit to us,  because AOL screen names function as e-mail addresses too. <br>
							<br>
							Age<br><br>
							The following registration information is optional: <br><br>
							State of Residence </p>
							
							<p>E-mail  address<br>
							(So we can  notify you if we publish your Creative Submission.)</p>
							
							<p>Please  note, none of the information we require through the registration process is  personally identifiable information. </p>
							
							<p><strong>II.</strong> To upload (electronically submit) your Creative Submission, you will not have  to reveal personally identifiable information. </p>
							
							<p>While your screen name and your state of residence may be collected if you upload a  creative submission to AbovetheInfluence.com, submissions that incorporate 
							any personally identifiable information will be immediately removed from consideration  for online posting. For the MOX photo and video submissions, AbovetheInfluence 
							may require an additional parental release to be signed.</p>
							
							<p>Any company  that helps us to run this Web site has signed an agreement indicating that they  will only use the anonymous information collected in aggregate for the 
							purposes  for which they were hired. </p>
