  <b>Information We Gather or Track</b>
    <blockquote> Information on general usage and any optional personal details
      you provide to us will be used to provide you with enhanced features such
      as customized content, access to our bulletin boards, participation in
      chats and the ability to participate in any of our GuideSite<sup><font size="-3">TM</font></sup>

      <ul>
        <li>About.com, Inc. collects data so that we may display personalized
          content to our visitors. Additionally, usage information may be
          analyzed so that we can judge our system's performance or execute
          your customized features.</li>
        <li> Your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (<b>I</b>nternet<b>P</b>rotocol),
          address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're
          connecting from. Or what service provider you are using. </li>
        <li> Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you
          allow their use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about
          your visit to any of our sites. Cookies assist us

          our GuideSites<sup><font size="-3">TM</font></sup>, cookies can enable us to customize our
          content according to your preferences. However, cookies tell us
          nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us
          additional information. </li>
        <li> Our registration form asks for contact and demographic information
          used to send news about our products or promotional material from our
          partners. You will be able to opt-out of receiving any mailings.
          Demographic information may be used to customize the display of our
          GuideSites<sup><font size="-3">TM</font></sup> to you by showing content that we think might
          be of interest or related to your past visits. </li>
        <li>Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying

      <ul>
        <li>We sometimes use provided information to personalize features of
          our GuideSites<sup><font size="-3">TM</font></sup> based upon your preferences. </li>
        <li>From time to time we extend various offers through our partner
          companies. These may include news or additional details on their
          products and services. Your personal preferences or usage history may
          result in your being offered special screens or products. These offers would be sent via About.com 
          and your personal information is not shared with entities outside of About.com, Inc.</li>
        <li>We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell
          advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally,
          how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our
          service. Where available, we may offer additional information about
          viewer characteristics. <i>However this does <b>not</b> include
          personally identifiable information about you or your online usage
          patterns</i>. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you.
          In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to
          potential customers.</li>
        <li>We'll use your email contact information to provide you with
          newsletters to which you subscribe, or for similar information we think
          you may find of interest. However, you can choose to opt out of these

        <li>As mentioned in our "What We Do With Collected
          Information" section, we provide our advertisers with aggregate
          reports on advertising activity.</li>
	<li> Feedback is used both by About.com, Inc. staff
          as well as the individual Guides for each of the GuideSites<sup><font size="-3">TM</font></sup> 
          Guides not only link to content from their sites and provide their own original content, but would have 
          available to them any information that you send them directly. Guide use of this information is bound by the principles
          and practices expressed here..</li>

	<li>Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online, 
personal or otherwise,  that information can be collected and used by others. 
For example, using chat, bulletin boards, or your e-mail, if you post personal 
information online you may receive unsolicited messages from others. About.com, Inc. will have no means to control this and takes no responsibility for your use of the Internet to transmit information.</li>

        <b>Children's Privacy</b>

        This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of About.com directed at children under 13. About.com will NOT:
	<ul>
	<li>collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes.</li> 
	<li>collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.</li>                               
	<li>distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.</li> 
	<li>give the ability to children to send e-mail, create personal web pages, participate in forums or kids chat rooms without prior verifiable parental consent.</li>
	<li>entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.</li>
	</ul>
	We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.
    </blockquote>

	<p><b>COPPA</b>
    </p><blockquote>
	Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA).  COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet.  We offer the following for the protection of children under 13:
	<ul>
	<li>Many About.com activities may collect information about children under 13, including e-mail, personal web pages, forum participation, and kids chat rooms. Use of such activities requires initial registration by the participant. Children under 13 who wish to register are asked to have a parent or legal guardian do so for them. The parent must provide a credit card number for verification that he/she is an adult. Upon verification, the parent can choose which activities he or she would like the child to participate in. The parent can change the selected activities at any time.</li>
	<li>If we obtain parental consent, we collect and maintain the name, date of birth, and email address of children who register. We use this information to contact children for subscription to newsletters and notification of contests. Parents can review their child's personal information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their child's information. Parents can review this information by logging on as a member and clicking on the Parental Controls link in their membership profile.</li>
	<li>We do not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from children under 13 or from sites that are specifically directed to children under 13.</li>
	<li>We use a technology called "cookies" to track what pages users visit on our service, as described in the previous section of this document. We also use cookies to check the age of registered users who enter chat rooms in sites located outside of the Kids channel. Users under 13 are not permitted in chat rooms unless their parents have consented to their participation, as above.</li>
	</ul>
	This site is operated by About.com. We are the only operator that collects or maintains children's personal information through this site. If you have any questions regarding this policy or the safety of kids at About.com, please contact us at: About.com, Inc., 220 E 42nd St., New York, NY, 10017, call us at (212) 849-2000, or email us at <a href="mailto:kidsprivacy@about.com">kidsprivacy@about.com.</a>
