<font style="font-size:9pt">Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our Internet information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this Web site.
<br><br>
<b>SECURITY</b><br>When you send confidential personal credit card data to us on an Abercrombie &amp; Kent Inc. (referred to in this Internet Privacy Statement as "A&amp;K") Web site, we require that a "secure session" first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). For further information about SSL and the safety and confidentiality of personal data transmissions over the Internet, please read about Security (SSL) in our <a href="http://aksupport.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/aksupport.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php">FAQ system</a>. For the protection of your credit card information, A&amp;K utilizes a VeriSign</font><sup><font style="font-size:7pt">TM</font></sup><font style="font-size:9pt"> secure Web site for accepting credit card orders.
<br><br>
<b>INFORMATION COLLECTION</b><br>
When you browse abercrombiekent.com, aandktours.com and/or any Web site owned, operated, licensed or controlled by A&amp;K and have not registered for any online service from A&amp;K, you browse anonymously. Personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or E-mail address, is not collected as you browse. A&amp;K does, however, use "cookies," "client variables" and "session variables" to collect information about how our site is used. Information, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you responded to an A&amp;K hyperlink or E-mail, is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to hyperlinks and E-mail offers as well as overall Web site activity and peformance.
<br><br>
<b>IP ADDRESSES</b><br>
A&amp;K collects the IP addresses used to access our Web site and the dates and times of access. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not personally linked to identifiable information.
<br><br>
<b>REGISTRATION FOR ONLINE PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES</b><br>
In order to provide you with a particular product or service online, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address, for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, submitting an application or booking request, placing an order, or participating in online surveys and/or contests and enabling us to provide an online product or service to you in an efficient manner. If you are known to us as a registered user of an A&amp;K online product or service, we may combine information about your use of abercrombiekent.com, aandktours.com and/or any Web site owned, operated, licensed or controlled by A&amp;K and the online product or service you utilize with certain other online and offline information we have about you as an A&amp;K customer and information you have provided to us as well as information available from external sources in order to customize your online experience and present you with relevant online and offline offers and updates. We also use a "cookie," "client variable" or "session variable" to enable our server to recognize you as a registered A&amp;K online service user when you re-enter our Web site. If you would like to learn more about cookies, please read about Cookies in our <a href="http://aksupport.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/aksupport.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php">FAQ system</a> for more information.
<br><br>
<b>INFORMATION USE</b><br>
We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, ensure proper booking, measure consumer interest in our various products and services and inform you about products and services. If you have provided your E-mail address to us or to a company we've partnered with to make their products and services available to you, we may send you E-mail.  These E-mails may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys both online and offline, from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources. These E-mails come directly from A&amp;K. You can opt-out from receiving E-mail from A&amp;K as described below in the section, "Declining E-mail". When we send E-mails to you, we may be able to identify information about your E-mail address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML E-mails. If your E-mail address is HTML-enabled, we may choose to send you graphic-rich HTML E-mails. Please note that we do not provide your E-mail address to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. Keep in mind that if you take advantage of an offer from an A&amp;K business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send E-Mails to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future E-mails from them.
<br><br>
We may also share information with law enforcement agencies in the event of a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity.
<br><br> 
<b>DECLINING E-MAIL</b><br>
A&amp;K provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail. We recognize the importance of providing you a choice. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these E-mails from us by simply replying to the E-mail and informing us of your preferences. All E-mail offers that you receive from A&amp;K will inform you of how to decline receiving further E-mail.
