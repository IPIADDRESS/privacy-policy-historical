<a style="display: block; position: relative; top: -95px;" name="section01"></a>
<h2>Information Collected Online</h2>
<h3>1. General Browsing</h3>
<p>We collect general information about our visitors’ experience with our Websites and this general information is not connected to personally identifiable information about individual visitors. The information collected includes which pages our visitors are viewing on our Websites and whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites.&nbsp; It also includes information on the type of browser and service provider used.&nbsp; For visitors using a mobile version of our Websites, this includes technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this information helps us provide a better experience for our visitors by being able to determine such things as how to best format our mobile Websites for various devices, our most desired pages, products and features, how to best direct visitors to our Websites, and where there might be browser or service provider connection issues.</p>
<h3>2. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information if You Are 13 or Older</h3>
<p>abercrombie kids collects personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily provide us with this information. You can provide us this personally identifiable information in many instances throughout our Websites, for example when you interact with the following opportunities: placing an order through our Websites; establishing an account; adding your choices and information about yourself and others to your account; emailing an item, post card or wish list; adding a message in the gift wrap section or on an E-Gift Card; entering a contest or sweepstakes (note that some contests or sweepstakes may require the parent/guardian of an individual 13 or older but under 18 to submit an entry using the process described below in "Contest or Sweepstakes Entries"); taking a survey; contacting us with a comment or question; and signing up to receive emails about our products and services.</p>
<p>Categories of personally identifiable information collected online include name, address, email address, telephone number, payment card information, child's name, address and email address, recipient's name, address and email address, purchases you make tied to your personally identifiable information, and any other information you choose to provide, including through your personal social media accounts, as described below.</p>
<p>Personal Information You Allow Us to Collect from Your Social Media Accounts.&nbsp; To create an account on our Websites or to participate in certain features, our Websites may allow you to chose to let us access information from accounts you have created on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and other similar sites ("Personal Social Media Accounts"). If you chose to allow us access to your Personal Social Media Accounts, abercrombie kids could collect some, and possibly all, of the data in the Personal Social Media Account to which you grant access.&nbsp; Depending on the terms of the social media site, this information could include: your name, email address, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, birthday, likes, education history, work history, current city, hometown, interests, relationship status, location. Once you grant this permission, abercrombie kids will be able to continue to be linked to the permitted Personal Social Media Account and collect information without a further request for permission, which could include later revisions to existing information or new types of information that you add.&nbsp; If you no longer want your Personal Social Media Account(s) linked to our Websites, click on the ‘disconnect’ link located on our Websites near the corresponding social media button and we will stop collecting this information.&nbsp; You may also be able to stop our ability to link to information in your Personal Social Media Account by following instructions provided on the applicable social media site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This privacy policy does not cover the privacy and security practices of social media sites where you have Personal Social Media Accounts. Please review privacy policies and terms of service on the social media sites if you have any questions about their privacy or security practices.</p>
<h3>3. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information for Children Under 13</h3>
<p>If you are under 13 and want to sign up for email marketing or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we have implemented the following processes:</p>
<p><strong>Mailing List Registration</strong></p>
<p>With regard to the general "Mailing List" registration at our Websites, we have a separate "Mailing List" registration process for kids who state that they are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 will only be asked to provide their first name, age, and parent's/guardian's email address. abercrombie kids will then send the parent/guardian an email notice and a request that the parent complete the "Mailing List" sign up for their child. After abercrombie kids sends the email notice to the parent to request that the parent complete the "Mailing List" sign up and consent, abercrombie kids does not add the child's name or age, or the email address of the parent provided by the child to its systems (however, if the parent has separately signed up for email, that email address may be in our systems). Before the child can receive emails and other promotional materials from abercrombie kids, the child's parent/guardian must consent by completing the child's "Mailing List" registration information. Whenever a parent/guardian completes and submits the child's "Mailing List" registration information, abercrombie kids will send the parent/guardian a confirmation email notification.</p>
<p>If a parent/guardian does not wish to consent by completing their child's "Mailing List" registration with abercrombie kids, the parent/guardian may decline completing the "Mailing List" sign up and consent. Should a parent/guardian initially consent to their child's registration by completing the "Mailing List" registration, they can cancel that consent at any time and request deletion of their child's personal information by emailing such a request to abercrombie kids at <a href="mailto:Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com">privacy_policy@abercrombiekids.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Contest or Sweepstakes Entries</strong></p>
<p>For each contest or sweepstakes we conduct for children who indicate that they are under the age of 13 (or other age as specified in the official rules for the contest or sweepstakes), we will only collect a child's first name and a parent's/guardian's email address. abercrombie kids will then send the parent/guardian an email notice and a request that the parent complete the "Contest or Sweepstakes" sign-up for their child. After abercrombie kids sends the email notice to the parent to request that the parent complete the "Contest or Sweepstakes" entry form and consent, abercrombie kids does not add the child's name or age, or the email address of the parent provided by the child to its systems (however, if the parent has separately signed up for email, that email address may be in our systems). Before the child will be entered in the contest or sweepstakes, the child's parent/guardian must consent by completing the child's "Contest or Sweepstakes" registration information.</p>
<p>If a parent/guardian does not wish to consent to their child's entry into the "Contest or Sweepstakes" with abercrombie kids, the parent/guardian may decline completing the "Contest or Sweepstakes" entry form and consent. The “Contest or Sweepstakes” entry form and consent may also allow a parent/guardian to register their child to receive ongoing emails and other promotional materials from abercrombie kids. Should a parent/guardian initially consent by completing the "Contest or Sweepstakes" entry form and consent or by electing to register their child to receive ongoing emails and other promotional materials from abercrombie kids, the parent/guardian can cancel that consent at any time and request deletion of their child's personal information by emailing such a request to abercrombie kids at <a href="mailto:Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com">privacy_policy@abercrombiekids.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Information Provided About a Child</strong></p>
<p>For parents/guardians who have completed their child's "Mailing List" or "Contest" or "Sweepstakes" registration, they can review the personally-identifiable information they provided about their child online by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy_policy@abercrombiekids.com">privacy_policy@abercrombiekids.com</a>, or a letter or postcard to the postal mailing address provided under "Contact Us" below. When making a written request to review such information, please be sure to include your email address and telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that you provide and we maintain about your child.</p>
<h3>4. Information Collected within the "A&amp;F Credit Card" Link on the Website</h3>
<p>If you apply online for an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch credit card, or once opened, access your account online (to pay your account, view your statement or account status, add authorized buyers to your account, request a credit limit increase or update the personal information associated with your account) you leave our Websites and provide your personal information directly to the issuing bank for the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Card. However, your name, address, and email address, as well as information necessary for us to provide you with the bonuses and benefits of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Card (which may include birth date, payment card number, and purchasing information), will be provided to us by the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Card issuer. We would suggest that you review the privacy policies of these third parties prior to providing them with your information.</p>

<h2>Using Information We Collect Online</h2>
