<h2>What Is Personal Data</h2>
<p>This policy will more specifically address the personal data we collect, use and disclose (i.e., process), which generally includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, month and day of birth, IP Address, billing and account information, and other information incidental to our providing goods and services to you.</p>
<a style="display: block; position: relative; top: -95px;" name="section1"></a>
<h2>Information We Collect Online</h2>
<h3>1. General Browsing</h3>
<p>We process navigational information about where you go on our Websites. This information allows us to see which areas of our Websites are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience by recognising and delivering more of the most desired features and services. Additional information, which is not personal data (for example, domain type, browser version, or service provider) may also be processed by us, which will provide us with information regarding the general use of our Websites.</p>
<h3>2. Location Information</h3>
<p>Our Websites provide features, such as a store locator service if you have enabled the location-based services on your mobile devices. The features on our Websites that require determining your location may make use of the GPS information on your mobile device.&nbsp; Sometimes we use other information, such as your IP address or nearby wireless access points or cell phone tower locations, to roughly estimate where you are to provide you the feature on our Websites that requires understanding where you are located.&nbsp; If you use one of the features on our Websites that require locating you, we will collect and process your location data for this purpose.&nbsp; If you do not consent to or disable location-based services we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code to find a nearby store; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Websites may not be available.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>3. Personal Data</h3>
<h3>Contact Us and Click to Chat</h3>
<p>If you complete a general "Contact Us" form on one of our Websites (for example, to comment on or ask questions about our merchandise), we may process your name, email address, and any information that you provide in the text of your message.</p>
<p>If you use the "Contact Us" feature available in the "Investor Relations" portion of our Websites, we may process your name, title, organisation, address, telephone number, fax number, email address, and any information that you provide in the text of your message.</p>
<p>If you use the Click to Chat feature on one of our Websites (for example to ask questions about our merchandise), we may process any personal data, and any other information that you provide throughout the communication.</p>
<h3>Sign Up for Marketing Email List</h3>
<p>If you sign up for our marketing email list (i.e., 'Subscribe'), or the marketing email list for any of our affiliate brands, you will be asked to provide your email address and your consent to the processing of your personal data. Signing up for our mailing list enables you to receive information about products that we provide via email.&nbsp; You can choose the frequency at which you receive marketing emails or unsubscribe if you no longer want to receive marketing emails from us if you go to the <a href="Unsubscription?storeId=19159&amp;catalogId=11556&amp;langId=-1" target="_self">unsubscribe</a> page, or from any of our relevant affiliate brands by going to the email and phone page within the "My Account" section, clicking on the drop-down menu to make your selection, and pressing ‘SUBMIT.'</p>
<h3>Sending Electronic Postcards, or Emailing an Item to a Friend</h3>
<p>When you send an Electronic Postcard or email an item to a friend from one of our Websites, the designated recipient will receive your name and email address, as well as any information you entered in the message. The email address information of your recipient is not collected or used for any promotional purposes by us or our affiliate companies, nor is such information rented, sold or exchanged with third parties. We do not review and/or process any information provided in the message content. You should not send Electronic Postcards or items to friends unless you believe your friend would be interested and want to receive the information.</p>
<h3>Gift Box Messages</h3>
<p>When you purchase a Gift Box you have the option to add a message. We do not review any information provided in the message content for the Gift Box messages.</p>
<h3>Creating an Account</h3>
<p>You are given the opportunity to create an account on our Websites. Creating an account allows you to enjoy a more personalised experience of our Websites, create an address book, save a wish list, and enjoy "quick checkouts" by having us automatically enter your billing address, preferred shipping information, and payment details. Creating an account requires you to enter your email address, first and last name, and to create a password, and allows you to provide your postal address, telephone number, payment details, birthday month and day, gender, preferred store, and favorite categories. When you create an account you will receive a welcome email that will be delivered to the email address you inserted into the email field during the registration process. By doing so, you consent to the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>To request to have your account cancelled send an email to <a href="mailto:Privacy_Policy@abercrombie.com">Privacy_Policy@Abercrombie.com</a> and include the email address of the account you wish to cancel.</p>
<h3>Creating an Address Book in the Account Section</h3>
<p>If you create an online account on our Websites you may create and use a personal address book (an "Address Book"), which allows you to save all of the different names and addresses to whom you frequently send purchases or gifts. When you want to send a purchase to someone in your Address Book, you can preselect the billing or shipping address from the entries in the Address Book or choose from the list posted in checkout.</p>
<h3>Saving Payment Details in the Account Section</h3>
<p>If you choose to add a payment type in the account section, you will be able to quickly access this information during checkout when you are signed in.&nbsp; Your preferred payment type will pre-populate during checkout, or you can pick another type by selecting from the drop down list.&nbsp; If a payment card is expired we will indicate this by highlighting it in red in the ‘My Account – Payment Info’ section, and you can update the information by clicking on the EDIT button. Only payment methods that can be used on our Websites will be available to select during checkout.&nbsp; You will have the option to add a new payment type during checkout by ticking a box that you want to store the newly entered payment details in your account.<strong><br></strong></p>
<h3>Creating Wish Lists</h3>
<p>When you visit our Websites, you have the option of creating a wish list to send to your friends and family (a "Wish List"). If you send a Wish List, your friends and family who receive the Wish List will be able to see your desired items, as well as make purchases directly off of that list. When you find an item in our online store that you want, you can add a comment and click "Add to Wish List." You can then forward the Wish List by providing the email address of your recipient. The requested recipient will receive an email which will link to your Wish List.
