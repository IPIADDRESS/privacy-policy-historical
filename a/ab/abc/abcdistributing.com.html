This data includes the number of pages you visit as well as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to our site, any terms you may have used in a search which directed you to our site, and whether you came to our site from a bookmark.  We cannot identify you individually from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the other major online services.  </font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">

<p>Naturally, if you request a catalog, we will need your name, the name of the company you work for (since abc distributing, inc. only sells to businesses) and an address where we should send the catalog.  We will also ask for a phone number we can use to contact you if any of the information provided is incorrect (for example, if there is a typographical error.)  If you wish to set up an account and purchase merchandise from us, we may ask for additional information. </p>

<p>We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.</p>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of data that are stored in the memory of your browser, and on the hard drive of your computer.  A cookie is used to identify you when you return to our site.  This makes your visit more personalized and convenient.  When you are ready to place an order, we use cookies to pre-fill out certain parts of the order form, such as your name, address and account number, making it easier for you.  They also allow you to place items in your shopping cart, leave the website, and then return to check out at a later time.  </p>

<p>Cookies also help us monitor whether our website is functioning properly and to perform site traffic analysis.  At any time, you have the option to set your browser to either refuse cookies, or alert you when a cookie is being sent.  You should be aware, however, that if you have chosen not to accept cookies, your shopping cart will be emptied when you leave our site.   In any case, the information provided by your browser or computer is used to maintain session contacts with you, and is not used for any other purpose, nor is it shared with others.  </p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
<p>Our web site is not directed at children.  However, children may access our web site and provide information.  They may request information regarding our products and services and attempt to order certain products and services.  Because abc distributing, inc. sells exclusively to businesses, there is less chance that a child will be able to place an order with us, but in any case, children should seek the consent of their parents before providing any information about themselves or their households on the Internet.</p>
