            <strong>USE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
            <br>
            Abcya.com uses the Information to improve the Website, as well as services provided hereunder. We use IP addresses for analyzing trends, administering the website and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. For security reasons, your Internet protocol address may be linked to other personally identifiable information about you. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <strong>SHARING INFORMATION</strong><br>
  <br>
            Although we share aggregate demographic data with our partners and advertisers, this data is not linked to any personal information identifying any individual person. Abcya.com may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable demographic information with its partners and advertisers.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
            Abcya.com will not share your personal information with any nonaffiliated companies except in furtherance of providing you goods or services that you have specifically requested.&nbsp; We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We sometimes partner with another company to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the companies to provide these services to you. These companies are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.<br>
  <br>
            When we share your personal information with nonaffiliated companies, we do so only under the terms of a confidentiality agreement which prohibits the nonaffiliated companies from sharing your personal information with others.&nbsp; We may also share your personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or in exercise or defense of our legal rights.&nbsp; In the event Abcya.com merges with another company, your personal information shall be transferred to such other company. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>CHOICES REGARDING INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong><br>
  <br>
            You have the option to ‘opt-out’ of having your information used for purposes not related to the Website at the point where we ask for the information.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
            We request information from you on our order form. Here you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
            This Website utilizes several security measures to prevent the loss, corruption or unauthorized dissemination of the information collected on this Website.
