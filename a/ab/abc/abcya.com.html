Abcya.com may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable demographic information with its partners and advertisers.&nbsp; <br>
       <br>
                 Abcya.com will not share your personal information with any non-affiliated companies except in furtherance of providing you goods or services that you have specifically requested.&nbsp; We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services.

When you sign up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the companies to provide these services to you. These companies are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.<br>
       <br>

       <br>
