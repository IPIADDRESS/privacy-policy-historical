							<div class="clear" style="height:1px;"></div>
							The Site currently offers “Family Accounts,” “Gift Accounts” and two different types of “Classroom Accounts” (collectively,&nbsp;“Accounts”):<br><br>										<div class="clear" style="height:1px;"></div>
									<span class="bold">(a)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="policy01"></a><span class="boldunderline">Family Accounts.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Accounts can be used on a desktop computer, a laptop computer or on select mobile devices (following an application download). A Family Account has a maximum of four members, including the Parent, their child(ren), and other extended family members and friends designated by the Parent. Each of these four members has their own login, and their Site progress, messaging, music, and artwork are separately tracked and saved. The Parent may also add their child’s teacher to the Family Account, and this does not count against the four-member limit. (Please note that the teacher’s status as a public or private school professional educator must be independently verifiable through their school’s domain-specific email address as listed with Market Data Retrieval in order to be added to a Family Account free of charge.) Only the Parent can determine whether, and with whom, their child(ren) can communicate on the Site, as well as who, if anyone, within their Family Account or within other linked Family Accounts can view their child(ren)’s progress on the Site. Only the Parent may add their child to a Family Account, after an Adult other than a Parent purchases a Family Account (e.g., a Gift Account).<br>&nbsp;<br><span class="bold">(b)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="policy02"></a><span class="boldunderline">Gift Accounts.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift Accounts are pre-paid accounts with the Site and are non-refundable and non-transferable. The person who purchases a Gift Account is the “Purchaser” and the person who receives a Gift Account is a “Recipient.” Gift Accounts are only available at the applicable annual subscription rate and remain active for a period of twelve (12) months. At the time of purchase the Purchaser must provide a valid email address for the Recipient and the date the Recipient’s Gift Account is to be activated, provided that the activation date may not be more than 30 days after the date on which the Gift Account is purchased. Company will send an email notification to Recipient on the day the Gift Account is activated. Purchaser may elect to receive a copy of the Gift Account notification. Company is not responsible for errors or delays as a result of the email address(es) provided by Purchaser. The twelve (12) month Gift Account period will begin on the earlier of the date the Recipient first logs in to the Gift Account or the date the Gift Account notification is sent to Recipient. Discounts may be available for the purchase of multiple Gift Accounts and all discounts or promo codes, if any, are applied at the time of payment. Gift Accounts are not redeemable or refundable for cash, subject to applicable law.<br>&nbsp;<br><span class="bold">(c)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="policy03"></a><span class="boldunderline">Classroom Accounts.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Accounts allow for the creation of up to five learning groups. Individual students would log in to the learning group assigned by the teacher, and up to 40 students can be logged in simultaneously. In this configuration users do not have separate logins, and their Site progress, music, and artwork are tracked and can be saved. To be eligible for a Classroom Account the teacher’s status as a public or private school professional educator must be independently verifiable through their school’s domain-specific email address as listed with Market Data Retrieval. Please note that students cannot communicate with anyone or post or display any content while using a Classroom Account. Classroom Accounts can only be established and managed by a teacher.<br>&nbsp;<br>							<div class="items_row_col_bold">

For Family Accounts, the Parent provides us with the first name, gender and birth date of each child enrolled, and for other members they add to the Family Account, the individual’s first and last name, e-mail address and relationship to the child. For Classroom Accounts, the teacher provides us with the first name, birth date, and gender of each student enrolled.

							<div class="clear" style="height:1px;"></div>
							Every Account has one designated Account Administrator. For Family Accounts, a Parent must always be the Account Administrator when children are added. For Classroom Accounts, a teacher must always be the Account Administrator. All Accounts have management tools, accessible via the ‘My Account’ link on the Site, that permit an Account Administrator to access, change, or delete information provided to the Site through an Account. For Family Accounts, the Account Administrator may add and remove Account members, as well as link and unlink their Account to other Family Accounts and to the Account Administrator of their child’s Classroom Account. For Classroom Accounts, the teacher who is the Account Administrator may add and remove their individual students, although they should not provide any Personal Information for students. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. When you edit or delete your information, such information may nonetheless persist internally for our administrative purposes. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. If a Parent believes that Personal Information of his or her child is on the Site in a manner that the Parent has not authorized, the Parent may contact us as set forth below in <a href="#policy7">Section 8</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>							<div class="items_row_col_bold">

							We never share your Personal Information collected on the Site with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties such as our business partners. On occasion, we may send commercial messages to adult members about Site offerings or products or services designed to enhance their Site experience. We may also send you information regarding the products, services or offers of third parties such as our business partners but you may always choose to stop receiving these messages as well, simply by following the instructions contained in the message.<br>&nbsp;<br>We may share your information, including Personal Information, with third parties who perform certain services for us relating to the Site, such as to process credit cards.

On occasion, we may send commercial messages to adult members about Site offerings or products or services designed to enhance their Site experience. We reserve the right to send select third party offers or promotions. Of course, you may always choose to stop receiving these messages by following the instructions contained in the message. You can also opt out of certain online advertising content by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</a> We may invite adult members to receive updates and information about ABCmouse.com through a social networking mobile application or website. We may also send you certain Account-related communications, such as information about your child’s progress on the Site, a reminder that your Account is about to expire, or information about updated Site’s policies. Unlike commercial messages, offers, or promotions, however, you may not opt to stop receiving these Account-related messages as long as you are a Site member.

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, however, we obtain the consent of Parents in order for children under 13 years of age (“Children” or “Child”) to use the Site in any manner that could result in the Child submitting Personal Information. For example, when a Parent authorizes their Child to use our messaging tools to communicate with another Site member, the Child could disclose their Personal Information to others. Thus, Parents authorize us to collect, store and distribute the Child’s Personal Information to Site members as expressly designated by the Parent. Additionally, we may link certain information collected through a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain information whenever a Child interacts with the Site, as described in <a href="#policy2">Section 3</a>.
