We currently offer the following types of accounts through the Services: Family Accounts, Teacher Accounts, Classroom-Linked Accounts, Librarian Accounts, Guest Library Accounts, Personal Library Accounts, Library Home Checkout Accounts, and Community Center Accounts (collectively, <span class="bold">Consumer and Other Accounts</span>), which are described in our <a data-clickable="true" href="/tandc/current/en/">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.

<p class="">Consumer and Other Accounts and School Accounts are collectively referred to as <span class="bold">Accounts</span> and the provisions of this policy apply to all Accounts. Any difference in how the Consumer and Other Accounts and School Accounts are treated is identified below.</p>
<p class="">Users of the Services include <span class="bold">Child Users</span> (any child under 18 who uses the learning portion of the Services) and <span class="bold">Adult Users</span> (including parents and legal guardians of Child Users, Gift Account purchasers, teachers, librarians, and community center administrators), collectively referred to as <span class="bold">Users</span>.</p>

However, we will only use or disclose this information in accordance with this policy and applicable law.

The other information provided at registration depends on the type of Account or Adult User. For example:</p>
<p class="section_3_a_1_2"><span class="italic">Payment information</span> is collected from Adult Users who purchase a Family Account, including those who purchase a Gift Account for others. For your security, we do not store your complete credit card number in our databases but retain only the first six digits and last four digits so that we can identify your Account and respond to your requests and questions.</p>
<p class="section_3_a_1_3"><span class="italic">A parent or legal guardian email address</span> is collected when the Adult User purchasing a Family Account or setting up a Personal Library Account or Library Home Checkout Account states that he or she is not the legal guardian, or if a teacher or community center administrator provides such addresses in order for parents or legal guardians to connect to the Teacher Account, Community Center Account, or School Account.</p>
<p class="section_3_a_1_4"><span class="italic">The school, library, or community center name and address (state and zip code only)</span> are collected from Adult Users who register for a Teacher, Librarian, or Community Center Account. Adult Users who register for a Family, Teacher, Classroom-Linked, Personal Library, Library Home Checkout, Community Center Account, or School Account are asked to provide the first name (or nickname) and gender, and may be asked for the birth month and year, of Child Users who will be accessing the Services through their Accounts.</p>
<p class="section_3_a_1_5">In addition, Adult Users can provide us with information through separate password-protected sections (i.e., the Parent Section or Teacher Dashboard) of the Services.  These sections, accessible via the Menu or Settings link on the Services, allow Adult Users to administer their accounts, including when they add Child Users, provide testimonials, seek customer support, or submit comments or questions.</p>

When we upgraded to the HTML 5 version of the Services, we removed some of these features so there is no longer the ability to upload photographs or audio or video files. Children still have the ability to create free-form artwork. We encourage you to use the Services with your Child Users and to view and monitor any content created or uploaded (if applicable) by them. If you would like to review all content saved by your Child Users, you can access this content by clicking on the My Files menu item in each Child User’s About Me section of the Services.</p>

Consent is required to collect or use the personal information of children under age 13. We will need your Consent prior to providing any tutoring services to your Child User(s). For TutorIQ, we will ask you for your Consent to collect your Child User’s personal information and to record your Child User via audio and video prior to the initial assessment of your Child User. You represent that you are the Child User’s parent or legal guardian and can provide Consent.  This Consent applies to all of the children under your Account. We do not share the recordings or any data from these recordings with any third parties and only use the recordings internally in compliance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. If at any time you wish to withdraw this Consent you must discontinue use of TutorIQ.</p>

                We and our third-party service providers collect information directly from users of the Services in the form of the actions they take and activities they complete when using the Services. For example, from Adult Users, we may collect information about patterns of usage and order history; from Child Users, we may collect information about patterns of usage, which activities a child commences and completes, when a child starts and stops an activity, which areas of the Services the child frequents, the number of questions answered correctly or incorrectly, how many Tickets the child earns, what virtual items the child selects to exchange for Tickets, and the child’s choice of Avatar and customization.
            </p><p class="section_3_b_1">We and our third-party service providers also use a variety of technologies, such as cookies (small text files that the Services save on your computer or mobile device), to automatically collect certain technical information from your computer or mobile device over time and across different websites, including when you use the Services, such as your browser type, operating system, device type, the page served, your IP address, your geolocation, and the websites you visited prior to visiting the Services. When you download and use one of our Apps, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>
<p class="section_3_b_2">We and our third-party service providers may use the information collected through these technical methods for a number of purposes, including delivering content, tracking and enhancing our Users’ experience on the Services, and delivering advertising to visitors to www.abcmouse.com when they visit other websites and applications. For example, when you return to the Services after logging in, cookies help the Services recognize who you are without having to log back in. For more information, see <a data-clickable="true" href="#section_4">Section 4 (How We Use Information)</a>. The information collected through these technical methods on the child-directed portions of the Services are used only to support the internal operations of the Services. We do not allow third-party advertising networks to collect information about Users who are logged in to their Accounts.</p>
<p class="section_3_b_3">If you do not want the Services to collect information through the use of cookies, you can set your web browser to reject cookies from the Services. Each browser is different, so you should check your browser’s Help menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences. However, please note that if you reject or block cookies from the Services, the Services may not function as intended. For example, you will not be able to remain logged in to your account, and therefore, you would have to log in during each page transition.</p>

<p class="section_3_b_1_3">During group Sessions, you and your Child User will be able to see and hear the other children in your Child User’s Session via your Internet Device, and they will be able to see and hear your Child User.

<p class="">In addition, with respect to Consumer and Other Accounts, we may use third-party advertising networks to collect cookie information about Adult Users’ visits to the non-child-directed portions of the Services and to (1) deliver interest-based advertising to those Adult Users, including ABCmouse-branded advertising, when those Adult Users visit third-party websites; and (2) provide us with statistics about the effectiveness of our advertising on third-party websites. These third-party advertising networks may use this cookie information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>
<p class="">As noted above, because TutorIQ Sessions may be in small groups (currently limited to four students), the other Child Users in a Session and any other individuals located within proximity to the Internet Device used by other Session participants may be able to view and hear your Child User during the Session. Likewise, you, your Child User, and other individuals within close proximity to the Internet Device used by your Child User may be able to hear and see the other Child Users. Please be careful and avoid having personal or confidential conversations within close proximity to the Internet Device during a Session.</p>
<p class=""><span class="bold italic">We do not disclose the personally identifiable information of any Child User to third parties for any marketing or promotional purposes.</span></p>
<p class="">We also may disclose de-identified and/or aggregated User information for any other purpose as permissible by applicable law—for example, the distribution of de-identified user records to outside researchers or the distribution of reports containing aggregate user demographic and traffic patterns—provided that no individual Adult User or Child User or any specific end-user device can be readily identified.</p>

                An Adult User can review or change the information they provided when they registered for the Services, including by adding or removing Child Users to or from the Account, by updating information through the Parent Section of the Services or, for Teacher Accounts or Community Center Accounts, by using the Class Builder or Settings feature in the Teacher Dashboard. In addition, Adult Users may contact us at any time as described in <a data-clickable="true" href="#section_12">Section 12 (Contact Us)</a> below to request that we provide for their review, or delete from our records, any PII they have provided about Child Users associated with their Accounts, or to cease collecting PII from those Child Users, as applicable. Please keep in mind that a request to delete PII may lead to cancellation of your Account or the inability to use certain Services, such as TutorIQ, and if a Teacher Account or Community Center Account is linked to a Family Account, a request to delete PII in one of the Accounts may be reflected in your other Account.
            </p><p class="section_6_1_1">When we change or delete any PII at your request, we will make good faith efforts to make the changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable, generally within 24–48 hours. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Please note that information may remain in backup or archive records, and we may retain certain data relevant to preventing fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable or de-identified data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at that time.</p>

Once the changes are made within the SIS, the changes will automatically appear within the School Account.
            </p><p class="section_6_2_1">If you are using the Services through a School Account and the Educational Institution is not integrating its SIS with the Services, any request to access, make changes to or delete PII including Student Data must be made by the Educational Institution’s designated administrator for the School Account.

Please provide as much information as you can about the PII you are enquiring about. We will respond to your request within 30 days (or less, if required by law). If you ask us to correct, update, delete, or change the PII we hold about you, we will do so if we are satisfied that this is required. If we decide not to change your PII in the manner you have requested, we will advise you of this in writing and will indicate how you can submit a complaint if you are not satisfied with our decision. If you request a change to your PII and we do not make that change, you may request that we make a note in our records that you requested a change to your PII that was not made, as well as the reason that change was not made.

            </p><p class="">At any time, Adult Users, with the exception of Library-related Accounts or School Accounts, may cancel their Accounts through the Parent Section or Teacher Dashboard section of the Services. Librarians and those with Personal Library Accounts or Library Home Checkout Accounts may contact us as described in <a data-clickable="true" href="#section_12">Section 12 (Contact Us)</a> below to cancel such Accounts.</p>
<p class="">For Family Accounts that have been canceled, and Personal Library Accounts and Library Home Checkout Accounts, if the Account remains inactive for 24 months, we will delete all PII in our active databases associated with the Account (<span class="bold">Account Information</span>). The 24 months is provided so that you have the ability, following cancellation of a Family Account or inactivity, to reactivate your Account and potentially recover previous information and resume where the Child User left off. However, we provide no guarantee, and shall have no liability or obligation to ensure that all Account Information and Services-related progress will be available or accessible or all learning or personalization features will be able to be recovered or resumed. If a User requests that PII be deleted prior to the end of the 24-month period of inactivity, we will take commercially reasonable steps to satisfy that request.</p>
<p class="">For Teacher Accounts and Community Center Accounts, if you cancel your Account, we will delete all Account Information 48 hours after the cancellation, <span class="underline">unless</span> a Child User’s parent or legal guardian has linked to the Account, in which case we will delete that Child User’s Account Information as described in the previous paragraph. <span class="bold italic">Please note that canceling an entire Teacher Account or Community Center Account will result in the loss of activities and progress data for every Child User, except for Child Users whose parents or legal guardians have linked to the Account.</span> If a Teacher Account or Community Center Account is not canceled, we will delete all Account Information 24 months after the last activity on the Account.</p>
<p class="">For Schools Accounts, Adult Users should contact their respective Educational Institution for any questions regarding account cancellation and data deletion. If an Educational Institutional terminates its agreement with AofL Schools, AofL Schools will delete, or if requested by the Educational Institution, transfer to the Educational Institution all Student Data within 90 days following the termination of the agreement with the applicable Educational Institution.</p>
<p class="">Upon Account cancellation, de-identified Adult and Child User information may nonetheless persist internally in our archive files or similar databases, and may still be used, on a de-identified basis, for our internal support, administrative, and record-keeping purposes including, but not limited to, allowing us to improve the Services and other services we provide through research, evaluation, and analytics as permissible by applicable law.</p>

We use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer technology) encryption to transfer PII. Other security safeguards include, but are not limited to, data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to buildings and files.</p>
<p class="">Account holders create a password in the registration process. You can help protect against unauthorized access to your account and PII by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. At registration, we assign a Member ID to each Account, and use those Member IDs to authenticate logins, allow access to the subscription content, and monitor compliance. The Member ID is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two-factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions.</p>
