        Kekros Systems, LLC (“Kekros”) operates the “Service,”  which consists of cloud services, IT services, including web, mobile Apps, websites, software, database, as well as research, development, consulting and analytical capabilities that are utilized in 
        conjunction with the above. Your privacy is important to us and it is our policy 
        to respect the privacy of our users. By using Kekros, you consent to the 
        practices described in this statement. Our Privacy Policy is designed around 
        these principals:
<ul>
<li>We collect personal identification only if and when it is required to register 
    a product or meant to be used as data in the creation of an agreed-upon 
    development or marketing solution;
</li>
    <li>We don’t share, sell, rent or lease your personal information except if 
        necessary to comply with the law, or to protect our rights;</li>
        <li>We don’t market to our customers.</li> 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Gathering of Non-Personally Identifying Information</b><br>
    Kekros collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web 
    browsers and servers typically make available (“Analytics”), such as the browser 
    type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor 
    request. Kekros's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is 
    to better understand how our visitors use our websites. Kekros also collects 
    potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) 
    addresses; however, this information is not used to personally identify or 
    market to our visitors. Rather, it is used to protect us against spam and to 
    help us to better understand our audience geographically. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Protection of Certain Personally Identifying Information</b><br>
    Kekros takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the 
    unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personally identifying 
    information. Kekros will not rent, lease or sell potentially 
    personally-identifying and/ or personally-identifying information to anyone. 
    Kekros discloses personally identifying information only to those of its 
    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that 
    information in order to process it on Kekros’s behalf. By using Kekros, you 
    consent to the transfer of such information to them. Kekros discloses 
    personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when 
    Kekros believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect 
    the property or rights of Kekros.</p>

<p>
<b>Ads</b><br>
    We do not provide any personally identifying Customer or User information to 
    advertisers or to third-party websites. Ads appearing on Kekros may be delivered 
    by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server 
    to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to 
    compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information 
    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that 
    they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use 
    of cookies by Kekros, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p>
<b>Security of Your Personal Information</b><br>
    Kekros secures the personally identifying information you provide in a 
    controlled environment, which is protected from unauthorized use or disclosure.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Privacy Policy Changes</b><br>
    Kekros encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. 
    Your continued use of this Service and/or continued provision of personally 
    identifying information to us will be subject to the
    <a href="TermsOfUse.aspx" title="Kekros Systems Terms of Use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and the-current Privacy Policy.
