This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track userâs movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp;IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p><h2>Communications from the site</h2><h3>Online applicants</h3><p>We send all new online applicants a welcome email confirming their username and password, which is required in order to use our online examination application service.&nbsp;</p><p>Online applicants who request to change or retrieve their registered password will receive confirmation of their chosen password via email.</p><p>Finally, upon submitting an examination entry via our online application form, confirmation of receipt will be sent to the applicant via email.</p><p>Generally, users of the online application service may not opt out of receiving these communications, although they can deactivate their account.&nbsp;These communications are not promotional in nature and are produced in the interests of providing the best possible service to online applicants.</p><h2>Customer service</h2><p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, post, fax or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.</p><h2>Sharing</h2><p>We currently DO NOT disclose any of the personally identifiable information that you give to us beyond ABRSM.&nbsp; We do not sell or supply any of the information that you provide through our website to third parties.</p><p>All users are given the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for that information.&nbsp;</p><p>Please refer to the Choice/opt-out section for further details.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Information regarding exam entries and candidates is strictly confidential and is never passed on to third parties.</strong></p><h2>Legal disclaimer</h2><p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.</p><h2>Aggregate information (non-personally identifiable)</h2><p>We occasionally share aggregated demographic information with organisations who are interested in either linking to or placing a link on our website and members of the press.&nbsp;This aggregated information will consist of user numbers, date and times of visits, userâs movement through the website in the aggregate and broad demographic information.&nbsp; This information will be provided purely to allow organisations to assess the suitability of our website for their own web audience when considering reciprocal links. This aggregate information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p><h2>Third party intermediaries</h2><p>We use a credit card processing company to process online exam entry fees. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p><h2>Choice/opt-out</h2><p>Our users are given the opportunity to âopt-outâ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for that information.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mailing list registration form has an opt-out mechanism for users who do not wish their details to be passed on to third parties in future.</p><p>Similarly, our UK online application form allows applicants to opt out of receiving copies of&nbsp;<i>Libretto</i> and other&nbsp;ABRSM publications, information on seminars and workshops and information on new syllabus developments.</p><h2>Links</h2><p>This website contains links to other sites.

Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are password protected and held in a secure environment, in a locked facility. Regular back ups are made of this data, and these are stored off site.</p><p>If you have any questions about the security on&nbsp;the ABRSM&nbsp;website, please send&nbsp;<a href="about:({E,online@abrsm.ac.uk,the ABRSM IT Department}">an email to&nbsp;the&nbsp;ABRSM&nbsp;IT department</a>.</p><h2>Correcting/updating/deleting/deactivating personal information</h2><p>If a userâs personally identifiable information changes (such as post or&nbsp;zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate usersâ personally identifiable information.
