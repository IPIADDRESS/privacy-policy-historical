<h1><a id="Top" name="Top">Privacy Statement</a></h1>

<p>The Associated Board is fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any personal information you provide to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We make&nbsp;every effort to ensure that all information that you provide to us is protected.</p>

<p>This Privacy Statement is designed to explain how The Associated Board collects information from you when you visit our website and how this information is then used.</p>

<p>Please read this statement carefully and re-visit it from time to time to review any changes that may have been made.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h1>Information collection</h1>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>In general you can visit The Associated Board website without disclosing any personal information about yourself.&nbsp; There are times, however, when we may request information from you.&nbsp; The Associated Board collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h3>Mailing list opt-in</h3>

<p>Users of <a href="http://www.abrsm.org/">www.abrsm.org</a> have the option of joining the Associated Board mailing list.&nbsp; In order to join the Associated Board mailing list, we require the following information from our users:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal profile (i.e. Student, teacher, parent or member of the press/media)</li>

<li>Full name</li>

<li>Postal address</li>

<li>Country</li>

<li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is optional for&nbsp;our users&nbsp;to provide us with their postcode and information on their instrument(s) of specific interest, but encouraged so that we can provide&nbsp;you with information of direct relevance to your country, area and personal music interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We use this information to send&nbsp;you a tri-annual copy of Libretto (the ABRSM journal); copies of new syllabuses; syllabus updates upon publication; and other information on specific instruments and events that you have informed us would be relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>Opting to join this list and the submission of personally identifiable information is voluntary and not required to use the remainder of the website.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h3>Online entry</h3>

<p>Applicants from the UK, Singapore and Malaysia have the option of entering exam candidates online.&nbsp; In order to use this service, applicants must first register by providing us with the following personally identifiable information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Country</li>

<li>Applicant Number</li>

<li>Full name</li>

<li>Details of any music degrees or diplomas held by the applicant</li>

<li>Postal address including postcode</li>

<li>Contact telephone number</li>

<li>Email address</li>
</ul>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<p>We also request financial information from online applicants (such as credit card number and expiry date).&nbsp; This information is used to process payments for examination entries. The online entry form is held on a secure HTTPS site (demonstrated by the padlock logo visible)</p>

<p><strong>Payment via the online form for UK applicants</strong> is processed via the Solve SE program and paid to the Associated Board via Barclays Merchant Services. Card details are held on the secure server for three days and then discarded.</p>

<p><strong>Payment via the online form for Singapore and Malaysia applicants</strong> is processed via the Korvac Payment Gateway and paid to the Associated Board via Barclays Merchant Services.</p>

<p>All exam entries are stored on an intermediate ISP server (ie held neither by Korvac nor ourselves)&nbsp;Once uploaded to The Associated Board via encrypted files, all exam entries are then held on&nbsp;our AS400 system in the same way as postal entries. All online information is held purely for the purpose of exam entries, and is retained on this secure server so that applicants can view their past entries.</p>

<p>We use the contact information supplied by applicants to ensure that examination schedules, results and certificates are forwarded to the correct address.&nbsp; In the event of any problems or complications with exam entries, this information is also used to contact the applicant.&nbsp; Finally this information is used to keep accurate records of applicant and candidate exam history, which allows us to provide a quicker and more effective service to our applicants.</p>

<p><b>Information regarding exam entries and candidates is strictly confidential and is not disclosed to external organisations.</b></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h3>Job Applications</h3>

<p>You may opt to provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae, in connection with a job application or enquiry, whether advertised on The Associated Board website or otherwise.&nbsp; We may use this information throughout The Associated Board for the purposes of employment consideration or to process your enquiry.&nbsp; We will not store this information for any purpose other than that relating to your application or keep it longer than necessary without your written permission.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h3>Making an enquiry/Contacting Us</h3>

<p>You may choose to contact The Associated Board in order to make a general enquiry by using the email form&nbsp;facility or other contact details provided on our website.&nbsp; In such instances your personal information will be used for the purposes of responding to your enquiry.&nbsp; If we wish to use your information for other purposes, for example, in instances when you are responding to a particular promotion or marketing campaign, we will tell you so and obtain your consent where appropriate.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h3>Associated Board Discussion Forums</h3>

<p>If you choose to participate in an Associated Board Discussion Forum, you should be aware that the information you provide there may be made broadly available to others, both inside and outside the Associated Board, who also have access to that discussion forum unless you specify otherwise.&nbsp; Each participant’s opinion on a discussion forum is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of The Associated Board.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h1>Information Use</h1>

<h2>Profile</h2>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h1>Communications from the Site</h1>

<h2>Online applicants</h2>

<p>Online applicants who request to change or retrieve their registered password will receive confirmation of their chosen password via email.</p>

<p>Finally, upon submitting an examination entry via our online application form, confirmation of receipt will be sent to the applicant via email.</p>

<p>Generally, users of the online application service may not opt out of receiving these communications, although they can deactivate their account.&nbsp; These communications are not promotional in nature and are produced in the interests of providing the best possible service to online applicants.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>We currently DO NOT disclose any of the personally identifiable information that you give to us beyond The Associated Board.&nbsp; We do not sell or supply any of the information that you provide through our website to Third Parties.&nbsp; However, in the future, we may decide to supply carefully selected organisations with personally identifiable information collected via our website.</p>

<p>All users are given the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for that information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please refer to the Choice/Opt Out section for further details.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information regarding exam entries and candidates is strictly confidential and is never passed on to third parties.</strong></p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h2>

<p>We occasionally share aggregated demographic information with organisations who are interested in either linking to or placing a link on our website and members of the press.&nbsp; This aggregated information will consist of user numbers, date and times of visits, user’s movement through the website in the aggregate and broad demographic information.&nbsp; This information will be provided purely to allow organisations to assess the suitability of our website for their own web audience when considering reciprocal links. This aggregate information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Third Party Intermediaries</h2>

<p>We use a credit card processing company to bill online applicants for examination entry fees. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>

<p>Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for that information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our mailing list registration form has an opt-out mechanism for users who do not wish their details to be passed on to Third Parties in future.</p>

<p>Similarly, our online application form allows applicants to opt out of receiving copies Libretto and other Associated Board publications, information on seminars and workshops and information on new syllabus developments.

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, The Associated Board, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The Associated Board website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.&nbsp; When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

<p>When our online examination entry form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and expiry date), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard Secure Socket Layer software.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our online entry form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; Personal information given by users beyond their name and address is restricted in our offices and made available only to the appropriate departments.&nbsp; All employees are provided with a unique username and password in order to gain access to this information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are password protected and held in a secure environment, in a locked facility. Regular back ups are made of this data, and these are stored off site.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the security on The Associated Board website, please send&nbsp;<a href="?page=process/contactform.html&amp;id=28&amp;contact=QXNzb2NpYXRlZCUyMEJvYWQlMjBJVCUyMERlcGFydG1lbnQ">an email to&nbsp;the Associated Board&nbsp;IT department</a>.</p>

<p align="right"><a href="#Top"><small>^Go to Top</small></a></p>

<h2>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h2>

<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@abrsm.ac.uk">marketing@abrsm.ac.uk</a> .</p>
