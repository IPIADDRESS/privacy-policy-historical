            <br>
            This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal 
            information for our services on Ablewise.com. It applies generally 
            to Ablewise.com website(s) and other related websites where this 
            policy appears in the footer of the page ("the Sites"). Some 
            Ablewise.com websites or websites we operate may be governed by 
            separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our 
            domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the 
            footer of each website.<br>
            <br>
            By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use in 
            registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use 
            and disclosure of your personal information as described in this 
            Privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            <br>
            When you register with Ablewise.com, you provide us with personal 
            information and consent to the transfer and storage of that 
            information to our servers located in the United States.<br>
            <br>
            We may collect and store the following personal information:<br>
            <br>
            * email address, physical contact information, and sometimes 
            financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers;<br>
            * community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence 
            through the Site, and correspondence sent to us;<br>
            * computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and 
            from the Site, and ad data;<br>
            * other information, including IP address and standard web log 
            information, and<br>
            * supplemental information from third parties. (For example, if the 
            information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send 
            us additional information (such as your driver license, credit card 
            statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information 
            confirming your address), or to answer additional questions online 
            to help verify your information.)<br>
            * Please do not post any personal information on Ablewise.com's 
            classifieds that you expect to keep private.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2. USAGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            <br>
            Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide 
            you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You 
            agree that we may use your personal information to:<br>
            <br>
            * provide the services and customer support you request;<br>
            * resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;<br>
            * prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce 
            our Terms of Use;<br>
            * customize, measure, and improve our services and the Sites' 
            content and layout;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>3. OUR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            <br>
            We may disclose personal information to respond to legal 
            requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing 
            or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone's 
            rights, property, or safety.<br>
            <br>
            We may also share your personal information with:<br>
            <br>
            * service providers under contract who help with our business 
            operations; (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, 
            affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards)<br>
            * other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your 
            information; (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified 
            and consent to when using a specific service)<br>
            * law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a 
            verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged 
            illegal activity; (In such events we will disclose name, city, 
            state, telephone number, email address, User ID history, and fraud 
            complaints.) and<br>
            * other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be 
            acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, 
            we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy 
            policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal 
            information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive 
            prior notice.) <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>4. ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH USERNAME</b><br>
            <br>
            Your Username is displayed throughout Ablewise.com and is therefore 
            available to the public. All of your activities on the Site will be 
            traceable to your Username. Other people can see ads that you have 
            posted, feedback, ratings and so on. Notices are sent to other 
            community members regarding suspicious activity and policy 
            violations on the Site and refer to Username(s) and specific items. 
            Therefore, if you associate your name with your Username, the people 
            to whom you have revealed your name to will be able to personally 
            identify your Ablewise.com activities.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>5. USING INFORMATION FROM ABLEWISE.COM</b><br>
            <br>
            Our Sites enable you to share personal information in order to 
            complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your privacy 
            practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot 
            guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore 
            we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of 
            your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing 
            to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow 
            only limited access to other users' contact(s). When users are 
            involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's 
            name, User ID, email address, and other contact(s). In all cases, 
            you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your 
            database and a chance to review what information you have collected 
            about them.<br>
            <br>
            You agree to use user information only for:<br>
            <br>
            * Ablewise.com transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited 
            commercial messages;<br>
            * using services offered through Ablewise.com (e.g. PM system and 
            fraud complaints), or<br>
            * other purposes that a user expressly chooses.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>6. COOKIES</b><br>
            <br>
            We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain 
            pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, customize our 
            services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and 
            safety.<br>
            <br>
            A few important things you should know about cookies are that:<br>
            <br>
            * We offer certain features that are only available through the use 
            of cookies.<br>
            * We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in 
            status.<br>
            * Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are 
            automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.<br>
            * You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser 
            permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Sites.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>7. NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING</b><br>
            <br>
            We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your 
            Ablewise.com notification preferences so we communicate to you as 
            you prefer. You are not licensed to add other Ablewise.com users, 
            even a user who has disclosed his/her contact(s) information you, to 
            your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express 
            consent. To report Ablewise.com related spam or spoof emails to 
            Ablewise.com, please inform us via the Contact Us page. You may not 
            use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content 
            that would violate our Terms of Use. We do not rent or sell these 
            email addresses.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>8. ACCOUNT PROTECTION</b><br>
            <br>
            Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for your 
            Ablewise.com password and do not disclose it to anyone. If you do 
            share your password or personal information with others, remember 
            that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your 
            account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose 
            substantial control over your personal information and may be 
            subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, 
            if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should 
            immediately notify Ablewise.com and change your password.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>9. ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            <br>
            You can review and change most of your personal information by 
            logging into the Site. Generally, we will not modify your personal 
            information because it is very difficult to verify your identity 
            remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it 
            changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may 
            not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close 
            your account and remove your personal information from view as soon 
            as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in 
            accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information 
            from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, 
            collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, 
            assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, and take 
            other actions otherwise permitted by law.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>10. SECURITY</b><br>
            <br>
            Your information is stored on our servers located in the United 
            States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use 
            lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to 
            protect your personal information against unauthorized access and 
            disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or 
            access transmissions or private communications, and other users may 
            abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the 
            Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, 
            we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal 
            information or private communications will always remain private.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>11. THIRD PARTIES</b><br>
            <br>
            Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this 
            document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we 
            collect from you. If you disclose your information to others on the 
            Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of 
            the information you disclose to them. Since Ablewise.com does not 
            control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to 
            the privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to 
            find out more about the relevant third parties' policies before you 
            disclose your personal information.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>12. GENERAL</b><br>
            <br>
            We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended 
            terms on the Site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 
            days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we 
            will notify you in accordance with your Notification Preferences. 
            Please direct all your questions to us via the Contact Us page.</font></p></td>
