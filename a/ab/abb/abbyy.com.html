<p><span>ABBYY USA Software House, Inc. (“<strong>ABBYY</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>”) has created this website (the “<strong>Website</strong>” or the “<strong>Site</strong>”) to provide a platform for sales, registration, and support for ABBYY's character recognition, data capture, linguistics, and translation products and services.</span></p>
<p><span>ABBYY is committed to maintaining your privacy.&nbsp; This Privacy Notice (“<strong>Privacy Notice</strong>”) outlines our privacy practices, including the types of information that you may provide to us, how we use such information and the choices you have regarding our use of that information.&nbsp; We may collect the information through our Website; when you purchase, register or use our products through computers or mobile devices; through our online support services; or through email messages that we send to you (collectively, including all online methods, the “<strong>Services</strong>”), or offline, such as when you attend one of our trade shows or contact our customer service line.&nbsp; Our Privacy Notice applies to (i) casual visitors to our Site, who do not participate in the Services (“<strong>Site Visitors</strong>”), (ii) individuals who purchase or register products through the Website or otherwise participate in our Services (“<strong>Registered Users</strong>”), (iii) users of our products and (iv) individuals whose information we obtain offline (collectively, including Site Visitors, Registered Users, users of products, and other individuals, “<strong>you</strong>”).</span></p>
<h2>1. Notice.</h2>
<p><strong>1.1.&nbsp;The Types of Information You May Provide.</strong> Information you may provide or that we may collect from you while visiting our Site or while participating in our Services falls into three broad categories: (i) Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Activities Information, and (iii) Anonymous Information.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We use the term <strong>“Personally Identifiable Information”</strong> to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, payment card number, telephone number.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Activities Information. </strong>We use the term “<strong>Activities Information</strong>” to refer to information collected by so-called “persistent identifiers” such as cookies and web beacons. Unlike Personally Identifiable Information, Activities Information does not directly identify a particular person; the information, however, is or can potentially be linked to a particular computer or device.</p>
<p><strong>1.4. Anonymous Information. </strong>“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>” is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our products and Services, your access to content on our Website, or the pages on our Site that you visit most frequently.</p>
<h2>2. Choice and consent.</h2>
<p>We have structured our Website so that you may visit our Site without revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. Providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Services confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><strong>2.1. Receiving Electronic Communications from Us.</strong> You can opt-out of receiving bulletins, updates, the ABBYY newsletter, or other marketing-related materials by clicking on the unsubscribe link here, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://promo.abbyy.com/SubscriptionManagement.html" target="_blank">Unsubscribe</a>, or on the bottom of each Marketing e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the Xerox Easy Translator Service</strong></p>
<p>Please be advised that if you elect to opt out as described herein pursuant to this Privacy Notice from receiving marketing email communications and from the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information, <strong>it will not operate to opt you out with respect to the Xerox Easy Translator Service and its associated website</strong>. You are required to separately opt out from receiving marketing email communications and from the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with respect to the Xerox Easy Translator Service pursuant to the separate Xerox Easy Translator Privacy Notice which may be found <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xeroxtranslates.com/docs/XeroxEasyTranslator_PrivacyNotice_en.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have previously opted out of receiving marketing email communications or from the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information <strong>only</strong> with respect to the Xerox Easy Translator Service and as provided in the Xerox Easy Translator Privacy Notice, please be advised that it will not operate as your opt out election for any other marketing email communicatons or your opt out of sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with respect to any other products or services offered or supported by ABBYY. <strong>In order to unsubscribe from such other marketing email communications or from the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information that are unrelated to the Xerox Easy Translator Service, you must do so in accordance with, and as provided in, this Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.3. Our Sharing of Your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliates for Their Direct Marketing Purposes.&nbsp;</strong>If you would prefer that we do not share your Personally Identifiable Information on a going-forward basis with our Affiliates (as defined in Section 7.1 (ABBYY Affiliates)) for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this sharing by contacting the Privacy Officer as described in Section 16 (Contact Us). If you opt-out from this sharing, you will also automatically opt-out from receiving marketing communications from ABBYY.</p>
<p><strong>2.4.&nbsp;Exception for Administrative Messages.</strong> Please understand that if you choose not to receive marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, such as notices concerning operation of this Website or other Services, products you have purchased, downloaded or registered for, and legal and other related notices concerning your relationship with ABBYY and this Site. You cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.</p>
<h2>3. Collection.</h2>

ABBYY has data retention and disposal processes to dispose of Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is designed to protect against loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access. Please note, however, that it may not be technically or commercially feasible to remove this information completely, for example, due to archived backups and records of deletions that are no longer reasonably accessible.</p>

<p>If you would like to review, correct, update, or delete Personally Identifiable Information you have previously provided to ABBYY, please contact us as provided in Section 16 (Contact Us). In your request, please make clear what Personally Identifiable Information you would like to have changed or what other limitations you would like to put on our use of Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us.

While we will try to comply with your requests to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from our databases, please understand that it may not be technically or commercially feasible to remove this information completely. We will try to comply with your requests made in accordance with this section as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<h2>7. Disclosure to third parties.</h2>
<p>We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>7.1. ABBYY Affiliates.</strong> We share information that you provide or that we collect with ABBYY Affiliates (our “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”) located worldwide, for all of the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including, without limitation, for the provision of technical support to you and for marketing purposes. By “Affiliate,” we mean an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with ABBYY, whether the control results from equity ownership, contract, overlapping management, or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>7.2. ABBYY Vendors.</strong> We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting or maintaining the Website, providing services related to the products and Services, collecting information, responding to and sending electronic mail, or other functions necessary to our business.

We require Vendors not to use your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p><strong>7.3.

<h2>8. Security.</h2>
<p>We have put in place security systems designed to protect against unauthorized access to or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us, and we take reasonable steps to secure and safeguard this Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

<h2>9. Quality / data integrity.</h2>
<p>We rely on you to provide us complete and accurate personal information and to contact us if correction of such information is required.</p>
<h2>10. Monitoring and enforcement.</h2>

<h2>11. Any information linked with your personally identifiable information is protected as “personally identifiable information.”</h2>
<p>To enable us to better understand the characteristics of our users and to provide services tailored to your needs, we may link the Personally Identifiable Information you have provided with Anonymous Information or other information.

An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser, and may use information about your visit to our sites, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. If the Advertiser requests that you provide to it Personally Identifiable Information, please be aware that this Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by its own Privacy Notice, and not our Privacy Notice. We recommend that you review the Advertiser's Privacy Notice before providing Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
