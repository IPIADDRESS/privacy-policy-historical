<p>AbbVie collects Personal Identifying Information that you voluntarily provide on AbbVie Web sites, for example, in order to register for AbbVie programs and services, register to receive marketing products and information, contact AbbVie customer service, or respond to AbbVie questionnaires or surveys. “Personal Identifying Information” means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Identifying Information include name, address, telephone number, and email address. When this information is combined with any information on health or medical status, we refer to the resulting information as “health-related information.”</p>
<p>If you choose to register for a program or service or to participate in our interactive services such as questionnaires and surveys, you may disclose health-related information as well as personal facts that could be used to identify you. To protect your privacy, you should not provide AbbVie with any information that is not specifically requested.<br class="first-child last-child">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b class="first-child last-child">Personal Identifying Information You Submit During Other Interactions with AbbVie</b></p>
<p>You may contact AbbVie to ask questions, discuss your concerns, or report problems regarding our products. If you communicate with or request information from AbbVie personnel, they will have your email address as well as whatever health-related and/or personal facts that you choose to include in your communication.</p>
<p class="last-child">If you are reporting a product experience, we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, age, gender, and prescribing physician. US regulations require us to collect this information in order to file reports with the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the safety of our products.<br class="first-child last-child">

<p class="last-child">We also collect nonidentifying information about your use of AbbVie Web sites through technology such as cookies and Web beacons. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that is transferred to your computer to track your interests and preferences and to recognize you as a return visitor. A “Web beacon” is a transparent graphic image placed on a Web site that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic. These technologies help remember your preferences on a site and allow us to bring you the content and features that are likely to be of greatest interest to you, on the basis of your previous activities on our Web sites. They also allow us to collect “clickstream” data, which is not Personal Identifying Information, but which reflects activities on AbbVie Web sites, including your interest in certain healthcare conditions or AbbVie services or products.

<p>We may use third parties to provide services and information on our sites and to assist with online marketing and advertising, and we may provide some cobranded services in partnership with others. We also may use third parties to analyze data collected on AbbVie Web sites. If we allow a third party to have access to your Personal Identifying Information, we will not authorize them to use it for any purpose that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy. Additionally, AbbVie may share your Personal Identifying Information with a third party in connection with the sale or transfer of one of its product lines or divisions, so that the buyer can continue to provide you with information and services. Except as otherwise explained in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell or disclose any Personal Identifying Information that you provide on AbbVie Web sites to an unrelated third party without your express permission.<br class="first-child last-child">
</p>
<p><u class="first-child last-child">Third-Party Web Site Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising; Ad Choices Opt-Out</u></p>
<p>You may be provided with online advertisements on third-party Web sites that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that is provided by you but that does not identify you (nonidentifying information),or of your Web browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first-child">We may share with our advertising companies your nonidentifying information, including nonidentifying personal information and other data that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies.</li>
<li class="last-child">We may use online behavioral advertising practices (this is also sometimes called retarget advertising or interest-based advertising). Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie Web sites and on other third-party Web sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p class="last-child"><br class="first-child last-child">
When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior.&nbsp;</p>

At a co branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours.
