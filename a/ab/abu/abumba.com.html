<h1><strong>ABUMBA.COM PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>
<p><i>Last Updated January 8, 2013</i></p>
<p>Abumba LLC (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) operates Abumba.com (the “Site”) and related mobile software (the "Software"), and other affiliated products and services (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Services and describes the Company’s collection and use of users’ personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address), and non-personally identifiable information (e.g., device information and usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.</p>
<p><strong>Your use of the Services signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.</strong></p>
<p>The Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@abumba.com?subject=Abumba%20Privacy%20Policy">privacy@abumba.com</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><i>User Submitted Information</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Personal Information You Submit.</strong> When contacting us for issues or creating a user account related to the Services, you may submit personal information (such as your full name, e-mail address, and other identifying information) to allow us to respond to your inquiry. Your submission is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information to us. In addition, when you install the Software on your mobile device, you may be asked to allow us access to certain information on your device, including your address book, contact data information, location, SMS messages, SD card contents, and other system tools. If you do not want us to have access to this information, please do not install or use the Software.</p>
<p><strong>Public Information and Posts.</strong>  Reviews, comments or content that you may voluntarily post on or through the Services, information about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a user name and/or user picture, as well as personal information that you may provide in your user account profile (such as your full name, e-mail address, and other identifying information), will be publicly available to anyone, and will be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines and sites.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Information and Content.</strong> If you access the Services using a third party service, connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user name associated with that third party service, any information or content you have permitted the third party to share with the Company, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service. Such third party information and content will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, and may be publicly available according to applicable policies and user permissions granted by you. In addition, the Company may supplement user submitted information with other information we collect or obtain from third parties.</p>
<h3><strong><i>Collected Information</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Accessing and Using the Services.</strong> When users access or use the Services, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected, stored and used for business and marketing purposes, such as maintaining and improving the Services, conducting research, and displaying more relevant advertisements. This non-personally identifiable information includes, without limitation: IP address, unique identifier number, operating system, browser information, URLs visited, pages viewed, search queries entered, and other software and hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other information for that device in order to serve content to it. This collected data may also be supplemented with information obtained from third parties or submitted by users.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking and Data Collection Technologies.</strong> The Company may use browser cookies, web and DOM storage data, Adobe Flash cookies, pixels, beacons, and other tracking and data collection technologies, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your use of the Services, including without limitation, web pages, features and content you have accessed, search queries you have run, referral URL information, links you have clicked on, and advertisements you have seen. This data is used for business purposes such as providing more relevant ads and content, and market research. The Company may also use these technologies and other similar tools to relate your use of the Services to personal information obtained from you or a third party. For example, cookie, click stream or other data about your activities using the Services may allow us to limit the content provided to you through the Services to items we think you will find interesting and relevant to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Data Collection.</strong> Third parties that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as tracking aggregate site usage or providing users with the ability to comment on or share content, may also use cookies, pixels and other tracking and data collection technologies described above to collect user information. The Company does not control these third parties and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies.</p>
