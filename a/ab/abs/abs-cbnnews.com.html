<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ABS-CBN Corporation, a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws, with business address at Sgt. Esguerra Avenue corner Mother Ignacia Street, Quezon City 1103, Philippines (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, "ABS-CBN") is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you a powerful but secure and safe online experience. This Privacy Notice (the “Privacy Notice”) applies to and governs data collection, recording, updating, modification or corrections, usage, sharing, storage, retention and destruction or disposition (collectively, “data processing”) by ABS-CBN in the websites owned and/or operated by ABS-CBN, including the website you are currently accessing (the “Website”). You are hereby requested to accept and consent to the data processing rules and practices described in this Privacy Notice so that you may continue to use and enjoy the Website.</p>

<p>Insofar as ABS-CBN processes your personal data for purposes of using and enjoying the Website, ABS-CBN shall comply with its obligations on data privacy, as specified in Republic Act No. 10173, otherwise known as the “Data Privacy Act of 2012”, its implementing rules and regulations, and all other relevant data privacy laws. Where applicable, ABS-CBN shall likewise comply with relevant data privacy laws of the country or territory where you are a citizen, a resident or otherwise accessing the Website.</p>

<p>ABS-CBN encourages you to review the privacy statements or policies of websites you choose to link to from the Website (the “Linked Sites”) so that you can understand how these Linked Sites collect, use and share your information. ABS-CBN is not responsible for the privacy statements or policies or other content on websites downloaded from the Website and other websites operated by third parties.</p>

<h1>I. Data Processing</h1>

<p>ABS-CBN’s activities, procedures and objectives in relation to data processing are guided by, consistent with and pursuant to the principles of transparency, legitimate purpose and proportionality as provided by law.</p>

<h3>A. Data Collection:</h3>

<p><strong>1. Personal Information you provide to ABS-CBN:</strong></p>

<p>To allow you to access and/or use the Website, including the creation, registration or maintenance of a user account specific to you (the “Account”), ABS-CBN may ask you to provide certain contact and personal identifiable details, such as your name, e-mail, home, work or some other address, telephone numbers (landline or mobile), as well as sensitive personal information, such as nationality, birthday, marital status, gender, educational attainment, occupation, religious, philosophical or political affiliations, family background, government issued data like social security number and passport details. ABS-CBN also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, preferences, interests and favorites. Please note that providing additional information about yourself may reveal your identity even when using the Website as "Anonymous" user. Further information may be collected when ABS-CBN exchanges communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact ABS-CBN's support team, or report a violation or complaint to ABS-CBN’s Data Privacy Officer at dpo@abs-cbn.com in accordance with your rights as provided below. Any such information you provide ABS-CBN is used for its internal purpose only and/or in connection with the Website, and will be treated with utmost confidentiality.</p>

<p>Any false, incorrect, or outdated information may impair ABS-CBN's ability to provide you with the Website and to contact you when necessary. ABS-CBN will explicitly indicate the fields for mandatory completion. If you do not enter the requisite data in these fields, you may not be able to continue to use the Website. Content or materials you upload and any other information you submit in the Website will be posted along with other personally identifiable information. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting these content, materials or information. At the very least, you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</p>

<p><strong>2. Account Log-in Details you will use</strong></p>

<p>For some websites of ABS-CBN, you may be required to log-in to your Account. To login, you must use your username and password that ABS-CBN allocated to you or that you have selected for your Account (the “Account Log-in Details”). ABS-CBN may also establish and require from time to time additional or different means of identification and authentication for logging in and accessing the Website or for accessing certain features or designated sections of the Website. Please note that the Account Log-in Details will be used to identify you when you use the Website. Your username will be included along with any information you submit for posting. It will therefore be visible to others. Your Account Log-in Details are under your responsibility. You are fully accountable for any use or misuse of your Account and personal information as a result of conveying your Account Log-in Details to someone else. You must maintain your Account Log-in Details in absolute confidentiality and avoid disclosing them to others. We encourage you to change your password frequently and at least once every six (6) months.</p>

<p><strong>3. Meta-data that ABS-CBN collects from your use of the Website and view of sponsored Content</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN keeps track of your surfing and browsing of the Website and its Linked Sites, collects information about your use of the Website, and may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit different parts of the Website or view its sponsored content, and what selections you make.</p>

<p>ABS-CBN may also automatically collect certain technical information such as:</p>

<p>(a) Device information. ABS-CBN may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile information if you use a mobile device to access the site);</p>

<p>(b) Log information. When you use the services or view content provided by ABS-CBN, ABS-CBN may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This information may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>• details of how you used our service, such as your navigation paths and search queries;</li>
	<li>• mobile related information if you access the Website using your mobile device;</li>
	<li>• internet protocol address;</li>
	<li>• device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL; and</li>
	<li>• cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, ABS-CBN may record the frequency and scope of your use of the Website, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, information that you read, content that you use or create, advertisements that you view or click on, your communications with other users and third parties, the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the name of the domain that serve you to access the Website, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to log-in. Such data is usually automatically collected and stored among others in log files of the Website's computer servers.</p>

<p>(c) Location and/or Route Information. Whether as "Anonymous" or as registered user, when you use your Mobile Phone with a copy of the Website, ABS-CBN collects your location and route information. ABS-CBN uses that information to provide you and other users with the Website. ABS-CBN may make further use of your location and route information by providing you information about sites, shops and other places and attractions in your close vicinity.</p>

<p><strong>4. Cookies</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN may install "cookies" to help you personalize your experience with the Website. A “cookie” is a HTTP file that is placed on your browser by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your device. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by the web page server of the Website that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>You can accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Unless you have modified your browser setting to decline the cookie, if you continue to use the Website, the cookie will be automatically installed. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Website or the Linked Sites you visit.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time by informing the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the website pages, or register with Linked Sites or services, a cookie helps the Website to recall your behavioral information on subsequent visits. When you return to the Website, your behavioral information from your previous visits can be retrieved, so the Website and its features can be customized based on your data.</p>

<p><strong>5. Information collected by the government</strong></p>

<p>You acknowledge that, pursuant to Republic Act No. 10175, or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2015 (the “Cybercrime Law”), law enforcement authorities, with due cause, shall be authorized to collect or record by technical or electronic means traffic data in real-time associated with specified communications transmitted by means of a computer system.</p>

<p>Traffic data refer only to the communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size, duration, or type of underlying service, but not content, nor identities.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the Cybercrime Law, the integrity of traffic data and subscriber information relating to communication services provided by a service provider shall be preserved for a minimum period of six (6) months from the date of the transaction. Content data shall be similarly preserved for six (6) months from the date of receipt of the order from law enforcement authorities requiring its preservation.</p>

<h3>B. Data Usage:</h3>

<p><strong>1. Performance of services</strong></p>

<p>The information gathered by ABS-CBN about you is used to operate the Website and deliver the services you have requested.</p>

<p><strong>2. Behavior Tracking for Customer Customization</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN keeps track of your surfing and browsing of the Website and its Linked Sites, essentially logging information about the sections and web pages that you visit and the actions you take. ABS-CBN monitors these connections in order to determine what ABS-CBN services are most popular and use this data to deliver customized content and advertising within the Website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Generally, ABS-CBN monitors your browsing behavior to give you – the customer - the most efficient service and the most satisfactory experience that ABS-CBN can provide.</p>

<p>If you do not wish ABS-CBN to track your behavior in our Website, your option is limited to closing the Website.</p>

<p><strong>3. Marketing, Promotions and Surveys</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN also uses your personal data to inform you of other products or services available from ABS-CBN, its affiliates, subsidiaries and external business partners. Thus, ABS-CBN may contact you for any or all of the purposes below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(a) to market, promote and advertise our products, services, events, initiatives and activities;</li>
	<li>(b) to customize our advertising, promotional and marketing activities;</li>
	<li>(c) to conduct research, survey and perform statistical analyses of user behavior in order to measure relative consumer interest on our various products, services and activities; and</li>
	<li>(d) to promote and manage our customer loyalty program(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>From time to time, ABS-CBN may also contact you to participate in surveys on your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered by ABS-CBN, its affiliates, subsidiaries or partners. Your participation in the survey is optional and not a condition for the continued use or access to the Website.</p>

<p><strong>4. Aggregated Data and Analytics</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN may also use collected data to create aggregated anonymous data and to use and share such data with its affiliates, subsidiaries, external business partners and Trusted Contractors (as defined below), for research, analysis and evaluation to improve ABS-CBN’s performance and delivery of services. ABS-CBN shall make commercially reasonable efforts to remove or obscure your personally identifiable information that are used for aggregated and analytics purposes.</p>

<h3>C. Data Sharing:</h3>

<p><strong>1. Cross-Promotions with ABS-CBN Affiliates, Subsidiaries, and External Business Partners</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of its affiliates, subsidiaries and external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In these cases, your unique personally identifiable information is not transferred to the affiliate, subsidiary or external business partners.</p>

<p><strong>2. Services of Trusted Contractors engaged by ABS-CBN</strong></p>

<p>ABS-CBN has contracted and may further contract trusted third party service providers to perform certain activities on behalf of ABS-CBN, to help ABS-CBN in delivering the services to you, or to help ABS-CBN in performing statistical analysis, sending you email or postal mail, providing customer support or arrangement for deliveries (“Trusted Contractors”). These Trusted Contractors may have access to, process, record, use, store, retain, or destroy, your personal data for the purposes stated in this Privacy Notice. All such Trusted Contractors are prohibited from using your personal data except to provide these services to ABS-CBN, and are required to keep and maintain the confidentiality of your data. ABS-CBN shall be responsible to you for safeguarding your personal information, unless you have entered into an agreement with such Trusted Contractor that would directly allow them to use and disclose your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Please note that ABS-CBN shall never sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.</p>

<p><strong>3. Disclosures</strong></p>

<p>Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Notice or in the Terms of Use of the Website or as otherwise expressly authorized by you, ABS-CBN will not give any of your personal information to any third party. However, ABS-CBN does not guarantee the security of any of your private transmissions against unauthorized or unlawful interception or access by third parties.
