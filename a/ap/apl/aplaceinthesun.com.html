<p><strong>Last updated: 2nd May 2018</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Notice (the “<strong>Notice</strong>”, for short) is intended to provide you with information about how we gather and use your personal data and about your legal rights under the General Data Protection Regulation – or “<strong>GDPR</strong>” – the European law on the use of personal data.</p>
<p>APITS Limited (“APITS”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. We maintain electronic and paper versions of this Notice and the electronic version is provided in an indexed format, so you can click through to the specific areas set out below.</p>
<p>The Glossary at the end of the Notice explains what some of the terms used in the GDPR and this Notice mean.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND WHO WE ARE</span></p>
<p>2. THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</p>
<p>3. HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED</p>
<p>4. HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>

<h2>1. Important information and who we are</h2>
<p><strong>Purpose of this privacy notice</strong><br>This Notice aims to give you information on how APITS collects and processes your personal data, whether you have provided it to us directly or whether we’ve obtained it from other people and organisations. <br>We may provide you with more specific privacy information where we collect information from you for certain specific purposes. If we do so, you should still refer to this Notice so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data and how we may use it in future. This privacy notice adds to the other notices and is not intended to replace them.</p>
<p><strong>Controller</strong><br>APITS is the data controller and responsible for your personal data (when we refer to “<strong>APITS</strong>”, "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>" in this Notice, that’s who we’re talking about).<br>We have appointed a data privacy manager who is in charge of answering questions in relation to this Notice. If you have any questions about it or if you want to use any of your legal rights, please contact the data privacy manager using the details set out below.</p>
<p><strong>Contact details</strong></p>
<p>Our full details are:</p>
<p>Full name of legal entity: APITS Limited, a company registered in England and Wales with registered number 06760085<br>Name or title of data privacy manager: Samantha Nelmes<br>Email address:&nbsp;samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com<br>Postal address: 4th Floor, 291-299 Borough High Street, London SE1 1JG</p>
<p>If you do have a problem, question or concern about our use of your personal data, we would appreciate the chance to try to help you, so please feel free to contact us in the first instance using the data privacy manager’s contact details above.</p>
<p>You always have the right to make a complaint about our use of your personal data at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”). The ICO is the UK’s supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).</p>
<p>You can contact us about data privacy issues in other ways, but if you contact the data privacy manager, that will make it much easier for us to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the privacy notice and your duty to inform us of changes</strong></p>
<p>This Notice was last updated on&nbsp;30 April&nbsp;2018.</p>
<p>The data protection law in the UK will change on 25 May 2018 when GDPR comes into force. Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data) until then as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these changes.</p>
<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>
<h2>2. The data we collect about you</h2>
<p>“<strong>Personal data</strong>” means any information about an individual, held by a data controller, from which the controller can identify a specific, living person. It does not include data about a living person that the controller can’t identify.</p>
<p>Some personal data falls into “<strong>Special Categories</strong>” under the GDPR and are given greater protection. These include any personal data revealing your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, and information about your health, as well as genetic and biometric data. Information about criminal convictions and offences is also treated differently from ordinary personal data under the GDPR.</p>
<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. The personal data we collect will depend on the relationship you have with APITS.</p>

<p><strong>Change of purpose</strong></p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please&nbsp;email samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party data processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes, in accordance with our instructions and with the data protection legislation.</p>
<h2>6. International transfers</h2>
<p>If you enquire about property located outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) – for example, in Florida - your personal data will be provided to the advertiser. We may also from time to time offer information, products or services from partners outside the EEA in relation to properties in their country or location. In each case, this will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>).</p>
<p>In many cases where you submit an enquiry about products, services or properties offered by a commercial partner (such as an estate agent or private seller) outside of the EEA, we may be unable to ensure a similar degree of protection for your personal data as exists within the EEA. In these situations, we transmit your personal data directly to the advertiser or partner at your request and on your behalf . Separately, we may also use the data provided by you for our own business purposes, as set out in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>In limited cases, we may act as a data controller in determining whether to transmit and process your data outside of the EEA. In these situations, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data as it would enjoy within the EEA by implementing at least one of the following safeguards:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</span></li>
<li>Where we share data with partner organisations outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</span>.</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. Not all our partners are members of Privacy Shield, so we may use model contracts instead. For further details, see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact&nbsp;samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com&nbsp;if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<h2>7. Data security</h2>
<p>We use secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.</p>
<p>They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting samantha.nelmes@aplaceinthesun.com.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please&nbsp;see below to find out more about these rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data</li>
<li>Request correction of your personal data</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data</li>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data</li>
<li>Request transfer of your personal data</li>
<li>Right to withdraw consent</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required</strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What we may need from you</strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<h2>10. Glossary</h2>
<p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p>

We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
