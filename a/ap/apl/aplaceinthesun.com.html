This site is owned and operated by APITS Ltd. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us and we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.

</p>
<h3>PERSONAL DATA ABOUT YOU (SUPPLIED VOLUNTARILY)</h3>
<p>
We collect information about our users through e-newsletter subscription. We do not share this information with third parties unless you have specifically requested that we do so, in order that advertisers and/or third parties can offer you information, goods and services that may be of interest to you. </p>
<p>We may contact you by email with electronic newsletters. The newsletters are sent out to the email address you have supplied. All our email correspondence includes an unsubscribe option at the bottom so you can easily choose to opt out of all further email correspondence.

We sometimes track user traffic patters throughout our site to determine which parts of the website are being used/not used. This tracking is never associated with individual users. It helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose information about demographics to advertisers, but in anonymous aggregate form only. We will not reveal your personal identity in connection with the disclosure of such information. </p>
<p>This information is stored by our data processors and us. We may employ external companies to act on our behalf as data processors for internal business purposes.

We may use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).</p>
<p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.<br>
