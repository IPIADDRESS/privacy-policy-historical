      </p>
      <p>
        4. Cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our web site if you do so.  We use cookies to credit your referral to a partner or affiliate who referred you to our web site.

Digicontracts.com does not have access to the information obtained from those cookies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        5. IP Addresses.  IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet.

Except as provided in this privacy Policy, no data or information which personally identifies you will be shared with anyone.  Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.
