Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our current online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage.
<br><br>
<span class="txthdrbluebold">What We Will NOT Do With Your Personal Information</span><br>
Aplia will NOT do the following with your personal information:
<ul class="txt">
<li>We will NOT sell your personal information, such as your name, email address or street address, to third parties. </li>
<br><br>
<li>We will NOT use your email address to send you marketing materials. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<span class="txthdrbluebold">When We Collect Your Personal Information</span><br>
You are required to register with us before you can gain access to the course sections of our website. During registration you are required to give your name and email address. It is only necessary for you to register once.
<br><br>
When you purchase a product or service, we collect your contact information (such as your address) and financial information (such as your credit/debit card information). We use the information you provide only to complete that product order or fulfill the service. We do not share this information with unaffiliated parties except to the extent necessary to complete that transaction. If we have trouble processing an order, we use the information to contact you.
<br><br>
When you enroll in a course, we may ask you to provide your student identification number for that course. We only ask for your student ID when your teacher has instructed us to do so. You have the option to not provide your student ID; however, not providing it may affect your teacherâ€™s ability to determine your grades.
<br><br>
<span class="txthdrbluebold">Why We Need Your Personal Information</span><br>
Your personal information is used <span class="txtbold">only</span> for the following purposes:
<ul class="txt">
<li>Your email address and password will be used to identify you as an authorized user of our services.</li><br><br>
<li>Your name may be used to identify you when you participate in an Aplia multi-user interactive experiment, simulation, chat session, email exchange or bulletin board. </li><br><br>
<li>Your email address may be used to send you your password if you forget it. </li><br><br>
<li>Your email address may be used to contact you about site and service announcement updates. You are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. </li><br><br>
<li>The contact and financial information you provide when you purchase a product or service will be used to complete that product order or fulfill the service.</li><br><br> 
<li>All of your personal information will be provided to your Educator for his/her administrative purposes. Generally he/she will use the information for grading and may use your email address to notify you of course issues. Please contact your Educator directly for any further questions relating to his/her use of your personal information. </li><br><br>
</ul>
<br>
<span class="txthdrbluebold">Anonymous Information</span><br>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our service and to share with third parties for the purposes of product development, research or statistical analysis. This is information which does not personally and specifically identify you but is derived from your use of our site. For example, we may tell a researcher that X number of individuals completed an experiment, but we would not disclose any personal information that could be used to identify those individuals.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Log Files</span><br>
We use IP addresses (an identifier for computers on the Internet) to analyze trends, administer the site, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, and comply with applicable laws. IP addresses are not linked directly to personally identifiable information.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Cookies</span><br>
Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your personal computer to maintain an uninterrupted transaction with our services. Usage of a cookie by our website is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you close your browser or sign off our website, the cookie simply terminates. If you reject the cookie, you will not be able to use our web-based services.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Legal Disclosure of Information</span><br>
Aplia may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Aplia; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Aplia; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Aplia site or the public.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Links</span><br>
Our website contains links to other sites. Aplia is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Security Standards</span><br>
We have established and continually maintain security standards and procedures to help us attempt to protect you from unauthorized access to confidential information about you, including through the Internet. Please read the Aplia Security Notice for a more complete description of these standards and procedures.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Aplia Employees</span><br>
At Aplia, any employee access to personally identifiable information is authorized for business purposes only and is based on the sensitivity of the information and our employees' or agents' need to know. We remind employees regularly of their responsibility for using personally identifiable information. Disregard of this responsibility will result in disciplinary action, including termination in appropriate cases.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Children Under 13</span><br>
We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our website, and so we carry out the same privacy policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Accuracy and Right to Correct</span><br>
We continually strive to maintain complete and accurate information about you. To assist in maintaining this accuracy we provide you with a way to review and update your personal information. Should you ever believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, please notify us. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies. To attempt to protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Notification of Changes</span><br>
Aplia reserves the right at any time to modify any of the foregoing policies. Aplia will let you know if we decide to change our privacy policy. We will post a notice of any changes on our website. As a result, you will always be aware of what information we collect, why we collect the information and how we use the information. If we decide to use personally identifiable information in a way that is different from what we said when we collected your information, we will contact you by email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different way. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Compliance with Laws</span><br>
Aplia is committed to complying with all applicable legal requirements in the operation of this website. Should you ever have reason to believe that Aplia's privacy policy does not comply with any applicable law, please notify us immediately. We will use reasonable efforts to investigate your concerns to ensure legal compliance.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">Business Transitions</span><br>
In the event Aplia goes through a reorganization, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling substantially all of its assets, your personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. If as a result of the business transition your personally identifiable information will be used in a way that is different from what we said when we collected your information, you will have a choice as to whether or not your information is used in this different way.
<br><br><span class="txthdrbluebold">How to Contact Us</span><br>
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@aplia.com" class="txt">privacy@aplia.com</a>.
