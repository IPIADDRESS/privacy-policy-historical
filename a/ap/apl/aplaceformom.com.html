    <h1>A Place for Mom Privacy Policy</h1>

<p id="privacyEffectiveDate"><strong>Effective January
2012</strong></p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. We have created this privacy
policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and so that you may
understand the collection, use, and disclosure practices of this
Web site as well as all other Web sites owned and/or operated by A
Place for Mom (individually and collectively, "Site" or "Sites").
The Sites are maintained by A Place for Mom ("We," "Us," or "Our").
We occasionally may update this statement and encourage you to
check the date of our privacy policy whenever you visit the Sites
to see if it has been modified since your last visit.</p>

<h3>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>For services provided on or in connection with our Sites, we may
ask you to provide personal information such as name, email
address, phone number and zip code, personally identifiable
information, health information, general financial information, and
any other information provided by or for you, and/or provided by
any other person for whom you may be seeking senior housing and/or
care services ("Personal Information"). We may collect and store
any Personal Information.</p>

<p>In addition, we may use Web site analytics tools, or other
technologies, like cookies and Web beacons, to collect information
about your visit to the Sites, including the pages you view, the
links you click and other actions taken in connection with the
Sites and our services. We also may collect certain standard
information that your browser sends to every Web site you visit,
such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times
and referring Web site addresses. We also periodically may obtain
both personal and non-personal information about you from other
businesses, business partners, contractors and other third
parties.</p>

<p>Like many Web Sites, we use "cookies", which are small text
files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit
certain online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies
to track use of our Sites and online services. We also may use
cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make the Sites
easier and/or relevant for your use. You have the ability to accept
or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you usually can modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the
ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. In Internet
Explorer 8, you can delete cookies by selecting "Tools", "Delete
browsing history". Then select the control box "Cookies" and click
the "Delete" button. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings
and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising
preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>

<p>Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy
Policy apply to information gathered online at our Sites, and to
information that you may submit to us offline; to Web sites
maintained by other companies, or organizations to which we may
link; and to Personal Information we may collect further from third
parties.</p>

<h3>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We use Personal Information to provide you with the services you
have requested from us and to provide services to the senior
housing and care providers who have contracted with us
("Participating Communities") to be part of our referral
information service program in relation to the services that we
provide you. In addition, we use Personal Information to send you
periodic email and newsletter communications about products and
services offered by us or third parties, to operate and improve our
Sites and services, to respond to customer inquiries, and to send
you survey or other communications.</p>

<p>We use Personal Information also for our own internal business
purposes including statistical, design or operational purposes,
such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic
patterns and understand demographic trends among our users.</p>

<h3>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We require your permission and authorization to disclose
Personal Information for the purpose of providing our senior
housing and care referral information service, and we will not
disclose to others except (a) as you (and, if you're searching on
behalf of a senior, the senior) may authorize in writing, or (b) as
required by law.</p>

<p>We do not rent, sell or share Personal Information about you
with other people except to provide products or services you've
specifically requested from us or third parties, and under the
following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Participating Communities.</strong> We may disclose
Personal Information to one or more Participating Communities in
order to provide you with the services you've specifically
requested. The Participating Communities may contact you directly
by email, telephone, regular mail, in person visits or other means.
We do not control how these Participating Communities use or
disclose your Personal Information.</li>

<li><strong>Other Third Party Providers</strong> We may disclose
Personal Information to one or more third parties with whom we have
contracted to provide services to us and/or you. In our agreements
with these third parties, the third parties sign provisions related
to confidentiality.</li>

<li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may disclose some or all of
your Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries,
joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us, in
which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li><strong>Internal Analysis and Operations.</strong> We may
disclose Personal Information for our own internal statistical,
design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience
size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand
demographic trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks
and disclose Personal Information about you to third parties,
provided the use and disclosure of your Personal Information by
these third parties is restricted to performance of such tasks and
subject to confidentiality.</li>

<li><strong>Legal and Other Compliance.</strong> We may disclose
Personal Information when we believe it is appropriate to comply
with the law; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other
policies or agreements; to protect our or our users' rights,
property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive
or unlawful use of, our Sites; or if we reasonably believe that an
emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical
injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or
justifies disclosure of records without delay.</li>

<li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may disclose Personal
Information as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing,
sale of company assets or other business transaction.</li>

<li><strong>Aggregated Information:</strong> We may share
aggregated, anonymous information that includes or is based on
information about you with third parties. This is information that
is combined with the information of other users and does not
directly identify you. Depending on the circumstances, we may or
may not charge third parties for this aggregated information. We
also may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated
information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Non-personal information collected at the Sites may be used and
disclosed to improve the performance, functionality and content of
the Sites. For example, we may collect and analyze collected
aggregate information to determine how many visitors arrived at
certain pages of the Sites, how long they stayed on those pages,
and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to
determine which pages might be the most interesting to our users
and enables us to provide you with a richer experience on the
Sites. Additionally, we may use non-personal information to improve
the performance of the Sites and to customize the content, features
and layout of the Sites pages for you.</p>

<p>Occasionally we share aggregate information with third parties,
such as our advertisers and business partners, for marketing and
promotional purposes.</p>

<p>We may supplement aggregate information collected from the Sites
with similar information obtained from companies with whom we have
marketing or other business relationships and other third party
sources. If aggregate information is ever linked with your Personal
Information, such information will be treated as Personal
Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy as long as it
is linked.</p>

<h3>LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES</h3>

<p>Please be advised that we may provide links to third party Web
sites from our Sites as a service to our users, but we have no
ability to control, and are not responsible for, the privacy and
data collection, use, and disclosure practices of such sites and
the privacy policies of such Web sites may differ from the Sites.
Therefore, we encourage you to review and understand the privacy
policies of such Web sites before providing them with any
information. These other Web sites also may send their own cookies
to you, collect your data or solicit your Personal Information.
Always be aware of where you end up. You have the ability to accept
or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
if you prefer. If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the
ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. In Internet
Explorer 8, you can delete cookies by selecting "Tools", "Delete
browsing history". Then select the control box "Cookies" and click
the "Delete" button. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings
and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising
preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<p>We use reasonable security measures to store and maintain
Personal Information to protect it from loss, misuse, alteration or
destruction by any unauthorized party while it is under our
control. Please note that while we will make reasonable efforts to
protect Personal Information, no transmission of data over the
Internet is 100% secure. All Internet users should take care with
how they handle and disclose their personal information. Please
refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a>
for information about how to help protect yourself against identity
theft.</p>

<h3>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES</h3>

<p>Third party advertisers or ad networks may use cookies or other
technologies on our Sites for various purposes, including measuring
the effectiveness of their ads and analyzing and personalizing ads
or other content delivered to you. We have no ability to control
the privacy and data collection, use, and disclosure practices of
such Web sites and the privacy policies of such Web sites may
differ from the Sites. Therefore, we encourage you to review and
understand the privacy policies of such Web sites before providing
them with any information.</p>

<h3>CHILDREN</h3>

<p>We do not intend, and these Sites are not designed, to collect
Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are
under 13 years old, you should not register for our services or
otherwise provide information on our Sites.</p>

<h3>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>

<p>Companies that collect personally identifiable information from
California residents and disclose such information to third parties
for marketing purposes must, in response to a request by a
consumer, either (1) provide a list detailing the categories of
information shared and the entities to which such information was
provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by which a consumer may
opt-out of having their information shared with third parties. We
have elected the second option and you may request that your
personally identifiable information not be shared with third
parties by sending your request, including your full name, email
address and postal address to: A Place for Mom, Inc. Attn: General
Counsel, 1300 Dexter Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98109. In
accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3, California
resident users are entitled to know that they may file grievances
and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400
R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at
916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov</p>

<h3>YOUR CONSENT</h3>

<p>By using our Sites, you consent to the terms of our Privacy
Policy and to our collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
Information for the purposes given above.</p>

<h3>OPT-OUT</h3>

<p>We may periodically send you newsletters and e-mails that
promote the use of our services. When you receive newsletters,
e-mails, or other communications from us, you may indicate a
preference to stop receiving further newsletters, e-mails, or other
communications from us and you will have the opportunity to
"opt-out" by following the opt-out instructions that we include in
the email and/or newsletter we send you. However, if you wish to
opt-out of communications with Participating Communities, you must
contact them directly as we do not control communications from
Participating Communities.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the
privacy practices of our Sites, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@aplaceformom.com">privacy@aplaceformom.com</a></p>

<h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>

<p>The Sites are published in the United States. We attempt to
comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the
extent they may apply to our services. If you are uncertain whether
this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy
laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal
Information to the Sites.</p>

<h3>CHANGES IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and
features to our Sites. In the event that these additions affect our
Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy will be updated appropriately.
We will post those changes prominently so that you will know what
Personal Information we gather, how we might use that Personal
Information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We,
however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you
use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the
Privacy Policy. We will not materially change our policies and
practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we
have previously collected without your express consent.</p>
