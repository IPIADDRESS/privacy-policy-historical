Other Apex Learning websites are restricted to those who are authorized to access them by Apex Learning and have a user name and password (<strong>"Apex Learning Customer Websites</strong>"); these Apex Learning Customer Websites include any Apex Learning course offering made available through such websites ("<strong>Apex Courses</strong>"). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from users through both the Apex Learning Corporate and Customer Websites (the <strong>"Apex Learning websites</strong>"), how we use that information, and with whom we may share it.</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Apex Learning offline or in any other way.</p><p>The Apex Learning websites include links to websites operated by others. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and this policy does not apply to any information collected by such third party websites.</p><h3>Modification of this Privacy Policy</h3><p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any revisions will be effective upon posting.</p><h3>How We May Collect Personal Information</h3><p>We may collect information that personally identifies you when you obtain a user name and password, when you participate in an Apex Course or when you otherwise communicate with us through an Apex Learning website. We may also obtain your personal information through an Apex Learning website if it is submitted by a representative of the institution (such as a school, school district, state department of education or other educational organization) or by the individual (such as a parent or guardian) funding your participation in Apex Courses (<strong>"Sponsoring Organization</strong>").</p><h3>Types of Personal Information Collected</h3><p>We may collect the following types of personal information at the Apex Learning websites:</p><p>1.

Your name and email address will be shared with other students in the same section of your Apex Course. Also, if you are a student or teacher, we may use your name, contact information, and school information to associate you with your Sponsoring Organization so you can gain access to the relevant Apex Courses.

We reserve the right to report suspicious activity to law enforcement for prosecution.</p><h3>Business Transfers</h3><p>Information about Apex Learning websites users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of Apex Learning.</p><h3>Third Parties</h3><p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties. Apex Learning may, however, use for its own purposes, aggregate information that does not identify you personally, or share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner that x percent of Apex Learning's students are from the West Coast and y percent from the Southern U.S.</p><h3>Children and Our Privacy Policy</h3><p>Apex Learning provides notice of its Privacy Policy to your school and any Sponsoring Organization. It is the responsibility of each school and Sponsoring Organization to obtain any necessary consent from parents to our Privacy Policy and to the enrollment of students in our Apex Courses.</p><h3>Non-personal User Information</h3><p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet. When you request pages from Apex Learning websites, our servers log your computer's IP address. Apex Learning collects these IP addresses for the sole purpose of identifying our users' service providers (whether AOL, MSN, etc.) so we can better develop our offerings at the Apex Learning websites. We do not automatically link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, however we can and will use IP addresses to identify users when we feel it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Apex Learning; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Apex Learning; (3) protect the personal safety of other Apex Learning websites users or the public; or (4) to ensure compliance with our Terms of Use, including the&nbsp;<a href="http://apexlearning.com/Terms_of_Use.htm" onclick="window.open('http://apexlearning.com/Terms_Of_Use.html','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=600');return false;">Terms of Use for the Apex Learning Corporate Websites</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://apexlearning.com/Terms_of_Use_Customer_Websites.htm" onclick="window.open('http://apexlearning.com/Terms_of_Use_Customer_Websites.htm','','scrollbars=yes,width=600,height=600');return false;">Terms of Use for the Apex Learning Customer Websites</a>.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>A cookie is a small packet of information that we place on your computer's hard drive whenever you visit the Apex Learning websites. For each user, our web server automatically recognizes the following:</p><ul><li>the host origin of the request (e.g., your IP address)</li><li>the referrer (e.g., where you came from if you arrived at our site via a link)</li><li>the requested document (e.g., the page being viewed)</li><li>your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer 7.0)</li><li>platform information (e.g., Windows 2000, MAC OS 10)</li><li>session data (e.g., whether sign in was successful)</li></ul><p>Apex Learning uses cookies for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the following:</p><ul><li>For session variables, to facilitate your navigation of content on the Apex Learning websites.</li><li>To determine if cookies are enabled in your browser so that we may ensure that our Apex Learning websites run on your computer.</li><li>To authenticate your access to content on the Apex Learning websites. For example, if you are a student in a chemistry course, we use cookies to ensure that you see only the chemistry course content.</li></ul><p>We do not store in cookies any passwords or credit card information, any information that personally identifies you, or any information that tracks you from session to session.</p><h3>Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Privacy</h3><p><u>Links to Other Websites</u>. You should be aware that when you are on any Apex Learning website, you could be directed by links or otherwise to other websites hosted by third parties. We do not endorse those websites. For example, if you "click" a link to a third party site we have listed on one of the pages on the Apex Learning websites, the "click" takes you off the applicable Apex Learning websites. Apex Learning is not responsible for the content or information collection practices of any third party websites. Please note that these websites may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with information.</p><p><u>What You Disclose</u>. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards, forums, or chats - that information can be viewed and used by people that you do not know, including but not limited to other students who access the Apex Learning websites. Apex Learning does not control their use of that information.</p><p><u>No Guarantee of Security</u>. No data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Apex Learning does not ensure or warrant the security of any personal or other information you transmit to us including without limitation via the Apex Learning websites.</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact our support department at: Apex Learning Inc. 1215 Fourth Ave., Suite 1500 Seattle, WA 98161 or via email at:<a href="mailto:support@apexlearning.com">support@apexlearning.com</a>.
