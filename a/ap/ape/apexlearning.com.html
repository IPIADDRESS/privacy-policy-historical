Other Apex Learning websites are restricted to those who are authorized to access them by Apex Learning and have a user name and password ("<strong>Apex Learning Customer Websites</strong>"); these Apex Learning Customer Websites include any Apex Learning course offering made available through such websites (“<strong>Apex Courses</strong>”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from users through both the Apex Learning Corporate and Customer Websites (the “<strong>Apex Learning websites</strong>”), how we use that information, and with whom we may share it.</p>  <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected by Apex Learning offline or in any other way.</p>  <p>The Apex Learning websites include links to websites operated by others. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and this policy does not apply to any information collected by such third party websites.</p>  <h3>Modification of this Privacy Policy</h3>  <p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any revisions will be effective upon posting.</p>  <h3>How We May Collect Personal Information</h3>  <p>We may collect information that personally identifies you when you obtain a user name and password, when you participate in an Apex Course or when you otherwise communicate with us through an Apex Learning website. We may also obtain your personal information through an Apex Learning website if it is submitted by a representative of the institution (such as a school, school district, state department of education or other educational organization) or by the individual (such as a parent or guardian) funding your participation in Apex Courses ("<strong>Sponsoring Organization</strong>").</p>  <h3>Types of Personal Information Collected</h3>  <p>We may collect the following types of personal information at the Apex Learning websites:</p>  <p>1.
