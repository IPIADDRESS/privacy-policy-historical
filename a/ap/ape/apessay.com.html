The person submitting the request must clearly indicate his/her full name and add a copy of his/her personal identification document or sign the request electronically.</p>
<p>The Controller is responsible for the collection, use, disclosure, retention and protection of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>«Processor»</strong> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the controller.</p>
<p>Being a <strong>Data Subject</strong>, each user has the following rights:</p>
<p>4.1 THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO DATA: the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not Personal Data concerning you are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the Personal Data and the information about the purposes of the processing; the categories of Personal Data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the Personal Data have been or will be disclosed; to obtain from Edutec Limited a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing in accordance with the applicable law; the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling.</p>

<p>- the processing is unlawful and the User opposes the erasure of the Personal Data and requests the restriction of their use instead;</p>
<p>- the Controller no longer needs the Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the User for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;</p>
<p>- the User has objected to processing (including profiling)* pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the Controller override those of the data subject.</p>

<p>4.5 THE RIGHT TO OBJECT: the right to object to the processing of the Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

<p>4.9 The consent the User gives us to the processing of the Personal Data is to be freely given. So each User has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time.
