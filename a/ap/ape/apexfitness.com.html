            <p>Welcome to Apexfitness.com!
</p><p> We want Apexfitness.com to be your source for health and fitness information, 
  products, services and tools. We know that your privacy is important to you, 
  so your privacy as you use our site is very important to us. This privacy policy 
  describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and 
  what we do to protect it. We hope that this privacy policy is straightforward 
  and clear, but if you have any questions about it, please e-mail our <a href="mailto:jill@apexfitness.com">Chief 
  Privacy Officer</a>.</p>
<p> <br>
  <b>Information We Gather </b><br>
  <i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br>
  In order to obtain access to certain portions of the Apexfitness.com website, 
  we ask you to provide us with various pieces of information, some of which may 
  enable us to distinguish you from other users. Certain other areas of the site 
  may ask for additional information on your habits or health. If you are a licensee 
  seeking to make purchases online, we may also ask for identifying information 
  that will enable us to process your orders. This registration information is 
  personally identifiable information because it allows us to contact you and 
  distinguish you from other users.</p>
<p>Some users may also buy health products, supplements, or other items on our 
  site. If you make purchases through Apexfitness.com, we need to gather information 
  relating to the sale, including what you are buying, how you are paying and 
  where you would like the products shipped. However, we will use that Transactional 
  Information only to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history 
  and to facilitate future orders. We may also use information about the transaction 
  for aggregate reporting (where we summarize the data in a report that does not 
  contain your personally identifiable information).</p>
<p>Our "Supplement Solution" tool allows you to enter personally identifiableinformation 
  and obtain suggestions from us as to which products might be of interest to 
  you. Though we temporarily store this information on our servers in order to 
  provide you with this tool, we will only use that information to provide you 
  with our Supplement Solution tool. Again, we may use aggregated information 
  concerning Supplement Solution tool users, but such use will not reveal your 
  personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We may receive additional personally identifiable information from you through 
  communications with Apexfitness.com. If so, we will use that information to 
  fulfill your request. For example, if you e-mail Apexfitness.com to ask about 
  an article or tool, we will use that information to give you an answer, to make 
  sure that you are satisfied with our answer, and to have a history of our service 
  to you. We may also include your request or communication in an aggregated report 
  of customer service activities in order to improve our service. However, as 
  before such use will only be on an aggregated basis, without revealing any personally 
  identifiable information.</p>
<p> <br>
  <i>Other Information</i><br>
  In order to maintain and improve Apexfitness.com, we also gather some statistical 
  data when you visit the site. The exact information we collect may vary, but 
  can include the date and time of an access to our site, the Internet Protocol 
  address of a computer requesting a page, the pages requested, and computer and 
  connection information such as browser type and operating system. We do not 
  associate this statistical information with your personally identifiable information. 
  <br>
  Also, if you respond to a poll, we will aggregate your responses with those 
  of other Apexfitness.com members but we do not associate your response with 
  any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
  Although we do not currently make use of "cookies," at some point 
  in the future we may begin to do so. We will not begin such use without first 
  posting the fact that we will do so pursuant to the User Agreement and this 
  Privacy Policy, as appropriate. "Cookies," are stored on your computer 
  and contain small amounts of information sent by Apexfitness.com to your computer 
  and read by Apexfitness.com when you visit the different pages of our website. 
  For example, cookies could allow us to remember your username and password as 
  you navigate around our site. For more information about cookies, please visit 
  The Privacy Foundation. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Children</b><br>
  Apexfitness.com is not designed for children. We do not knowingly collect any 
  information from children under 18.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>How We Use That Information </b><br>
  As noted, we gather information for purposes of providing and improving Apexfitness.com 
  for you. For example, we use the information to allocate system resources and 
  communicate with you about updates and new features, among other things. We 
  also aggregate information supplied by users during registration and information 
  about their use of Apexfitness.com to maintain our services and describe our 
  user base to potential partners, investors and advertisers. In providing this 
  aggregated data about our community of users, however, we do not reveal any 
  user's personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We do not rent, sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable 
  information to any third party, except in limited circumstances set forth here. 
  <br>
  We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling 
  orders, delivering packages, providing customer service, sending mail, processing 
  credit card payments, holding live chats, hosting message boards or other functions 
  necessary for us to provide services to you. We may need to share your personally 
  identifiable information with these companies. However, we will provide them 
  with only the information necessary to perform their functions, and will not 
  allow them to use that information for any other purposes.</p>
<p>To enhance our service, we may offer users the opportunity to participate in 
  partnerships we may have with other businesses. If you choose to participate 
  in one of these partnerships (for example, during the registration process), 
  we may share with our partner the personally identifiable information it needs 
  to offer its services to you. In such cases we'll post clear notices to identify 
  the partner. If you're not comfortable with their privacy guidelines or for 
  any other reason, you'll always have the choice not to use those features or 
  services.</p>
<p>We may reveal your personally identifiable information as necessary, if we 
  reasonably believe that you harming or interfering with other Apexfitness.com 
  users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our 
  User Agreement, or infringing any of Apexfitness.com's rights, or trespassing 
  on, damaging, or abusing any of Apexfitness.com's property.</p>
<p>Apexfitness.com will reveal information, including personally identifiable 
  information, to the extent it believes it is required to do so by law. If we 
  are asked by subpoena or other legal means to disclose any of your personally 
  identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to notify you 
  via any e-mail address we have on file for you at least ten days before we respond 
  to the request.</p>
<p>Apexfitness.com may transfer any information, including any personally identifiable 
  information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets of the company. 
</p>
<p><b>Policy Changes </b><br>
  If we change this privacy policy in any substantial way, we will notify you 
  at least thirty days in advance by posting a notice of the change prominently 
  on our Web site. Changes will not be applied retroactively to information obtained 
  under a previous policy without your express consent. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Questions About This Policy </b><br>
  If you have any questions about this privacy policy or other privacy questions 
  about us, please email our <a href="mailto:jill@apexfitness.com">Chief Privacy 
  Officer</a>.<br>
