			welcomes you. We value your privacy, and want you to know what information we collect and what we do with it.<br>
			Information Collected by Aptoday.com<br>
			<br>
			You can visit/surf Aptoday.com without providing any personal information. However, if you choose to avail of certain services on our website, you shall be required to provide certain information for the registration and/or access to such services/web pages. Such information may include, without limitation, your name, email address, contact address, mobile/telephone number(s), sex, age, occupation, interests, financial information, content, IP address, standard web log information and such other information as may be required for your interaction with the services.<br>
			Information Provided to Aptoday.com<br>
			<br>
			Aptoday.com features certain areas where we ask you to provide information to us.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Communications with Us:</strong><br>
			<br>
			We have features where you can submit information to us (such as when contact us, Advertising with us, with a question or problem related to the service). We will retain your emails and other information you submit to us for our internal purposes, and to help us to serve you better.<br>
			Automatic Data Collection:<br>
			<strong><br>
			Cookies:</strong><br>
			<br>
			We use a software technology called &amp;ldquo;cookies&amp;rdquo; for several purposes, depending on the type of cookie employed. Within Aptoday.com, we use what are commonly called &amp;ldquo;session&amp;rdquo; cookies, meaning that they only last as long as you are online. We use these cookies to identify you as a valid subscriber so that we can deliver music to you, to ensure that no one else can sign on simultaneously with your account from another computer and to help us personalize your service experience based on your registration preferences (such as genre). We may also use session cookies to help us facilitate any promotions or surveys that we provide. As part of the sign-in process, we may also use what are commonly called &amp;ldquo;persistent&amp;rdquo; cookies which stay with you after your session is over and you are offline. We only use these cookies in connection with a sign-in feature that allows you to save your member name and password so that the next time you sign in, these fields will be pre populated for you. This cookie is only offered in conjunction with certain Affiliate Sites that choose to make it available and it can only be activated if you select that option during your sign-in. If you select this option you can always deselect it each time you sign-in.<br>
			<strong><br>
			Others:</strong><br>
			<br>
			In order to personalize our service for your enjoyment and to monitor and improve the performance of our technology, we do collect/capture other data such as a member&amp;rsquo;s searches (such as their search criteria and results).

You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission. We may share (provide and receive) with others certain aggregate service information, which is not personally identifiable. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information (such as your email address).
