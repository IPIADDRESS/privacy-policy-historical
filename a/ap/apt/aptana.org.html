        			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        			<p>
                    Aptana Inc. values an individual's right to personal privacy as much as we 
					value our own privacy. We will collect and use information through our Web site 
					only in the ways disclosed in this statement. We will not sell your personal 
					information or share it with other parties, unless necessary, as dictated by abuse. 
					This statement applies solely to information collected at Aptana's web site and 
					through Aptana Studio. </p>
					
					<h2>Information collection</h2>
        			<p>As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any 
					personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online 
					or hosted Products and Services, Aptana may ask you to provide certain information about 
					yourself by filling out and submitting a form. This is optional. If you elect to engage in 
					these activities, however, Aptana may ask you to provide personal information, such as your 
					first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country of residence, email 
					address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other 
					personal information. When ordering Products and Services via the Site, you may be asked to 
					provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask 
					you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the 
					mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in 
					that activity.</p>

					
					<p>When you use the Site and the Products and Services, Aptana may also collect certain 
					information about your computer to facilitate and evaluate your use of the Site and the Products 
					and Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating 
					system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your 
					computer. Aptana also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of 
					the Products and Services. We do not match such information with any other information held by 
					Aptana unless we have your consent, or find it necessary to do so because of abuse or misuse.</p>
					
					<p>By using this Site and the Products and Services, you agree and acknowledge that personal 
					information collected through the Site or in connection with the Products and Services may be 
					transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries around 
					the world in which Aptana maintains offices, including the United States.</p>
        			
					<h2>Information usage</h2>
					
					<p>Aptana collects your information in order to record, support and facilitate your participation 
					in the activities you select. If you subscribe to or register for Products and Services, for example, 
					the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that 
					may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is 
					collected to qualify the entry and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards.</p>
					
					<p>Aptana may collect information about the use of the Products and Services and the Site, such as the 
					number of downloads, types of Services used, how many users we receive daily, and the IP/Internet address 
					of your computer. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually.</p>
					
					<p>Aptana may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for improving the Site and the Products 
					and Services, providing more relevant experiences to our customers and for statistical analysis.</p>

					
					<p>Certain Products and Services may require you to use the most current version of such Product and 
					Service or are offered in conjunction with other Products and Services, which you may or may not have 
					already downloaded. The Product and Service may automatically check to determine if you are using the most current 
					version or have other Products and Services and through e-mail messages, pop-up boxes or similar mechanisms inform 
					you if need to upgrade in order to use the Product and Service you have requested. During this process, an IP address 
					identifying your computer and the Product and Service version may be sent to a Web server, but system profile 
					information is not transmitted nor are cookies used to store information.</p>
					
       			</div>
    			<div class="column2">
        			
			
					<h2>Information choices</h2>
					
        			<p>Aptana recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site 
					and in connection with the Products and Services. Aptana will respect your legal rights regarding access to 
					and correction and deletion of your personal information. Except in the particular circumstances described in 
					this Privacy Policy, Aptana will not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
					
					<p>There are other instances in which Aptana may divulge your personal information, such as where required by 
					law, regulation, security reasons, or litigation.</p>
					
					<h2>Information protection</h2>

					
					<p>The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or 
					of the Products and Services is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in 
					several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID 
					selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In 
					addition, your Registration Information resides on secure servers that only selected Aptana personnel and contractors 
					have access to via password. Aptana encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized 
					parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to Aptana.</p>
					
					<p>Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on secure 
					servers and is accessible only to selected Aptana personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is 
					not accessible online by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.</p>
					
					<p>Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board, blog or chat room, such as the Aptana Forums is 
					available to all persons accessing that location, and your e-mail address may also be posted on these venues. The 
					information you share, including your email address, would then be available to all persons accessing these venues, and 
					such information may be read, collected or used by others for any purpose, including sending you unsolicited messages. 
					Aptana is not responsible for any information you elect to submit in these venues or the use of such information.</p>
					
					<h2>Information tracking</h2>
					
					<p>In order to improve our Products and Services and the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to 
					our customers, we and our vendors may use "cookies", "web beacons", and similar devices to track your activities. 
					A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server 
					that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables Aptana to record your passwords, purchases, 
					and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that 
					is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used 
					by which a Product and Service may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as the "Proceed 
					to Checkout" button is clicked. This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only 
					be read by the server that receives the data. It is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not 
					function as an identification card, and does not store any data on your computer.</p>
					
					<p>While Aptana uses cookies and similar devices to track your use of the Site and the Products and Services, such as 
					the number of downloads, types of Products and Services used and downloaded, how many users we receive daily, and our 
					web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, Aptana does not generally use this information 
					to identify you personally.</p>

					
					<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and most Products and Services that include similar devices are 
					typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving 
					you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are 
					not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages 
					or the related Products and Services.)</p>
