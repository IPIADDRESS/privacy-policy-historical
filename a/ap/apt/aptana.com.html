                for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information
                about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information.  As a visitor to this Site,
                you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information.

                If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Aptana may ask you to provide Personal Information, such
                as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country of residence, email address,
                employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other Personal Information. When
                ordering Products and Services via the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.  If you provide
                us feedback, contact us via e-mail, participate in one of our surveys, or submit a support request via our
                website, we may collect additional Personal Information, such as your name and email address, and any
                information that you submit to us.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to
                provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with
                respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.  We may also receive
                information about you from other sources such as telephone or fax, or from our third party service providers
                and our contractors.

             When you use the Site and the Products and Services, Aptana may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, improve, and evaluate your use of the Site and the Products and Services.  For example, we may log the number of downloads, types of Services used, how many users we receive daily, and environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit web pages, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer ("<b>Usage Information</b>").  Aptana also uses Usage Information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Products and Services.

If you subscribe to or register for Products and Services, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.

                The Personal Information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or of the Products and Services is classified as "<b>Registration Information</b>". Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.  This password is encrypted.  We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  In addition, your Registration Information resides on servers to which Aptana only provides access to select personnel and contractors via password.  Aptana encrypts your Personal Information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to Aptana.

                Personal Information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on servers to which Aptana only provides access to select Aptana personnel and contractors via password.  Since this information is not accessible online by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.

                Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board, blog or chat room, such as the Aptana Forums is available to all persons accessing that location, and your e-mail address may also be posted on these venues. The information you share, including your email address, would then be available to all persons accessing these venues, and such information may be read, collected or used by others for any purpose, including sending you unsolicited messages.

                In order to improve our Products and Services and the Site and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our vendors may use "cookies", "web beacons", and similar devices to track your activities.  A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables Aptana to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.  A web beacon is a small transparent gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. A similar device may be used by which a Product and Service may send data to a server when a set of user-initiated events occur such as the "Proceed to Checkout" button is clicked.  This device is similar to a cookie in that it tracks your visit and the data can only be read by the server that receives the data. It is different than a cookie in that it is not browser-based, may not function as an identification card, and does not store any data on your computer.

            </div>
            <div class="box-txt-desc box-txt-desc-tight">
                Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and most Products and Services that include similar devices are typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices will probably not be able to access those pages or the related Products and Services.)

                Certain Products and Services may require you to use the most current version of such Product and Service or are offered in conjunction with other Products and Services, which you may or may not have already downloaded. The Product and Service may automatically check to determine if you are using the most current version or have other Products and Services and through e-mail messages, pop-up boxes or similar mechanisms inform you if need to upgrade in order to use the Product and Service you have requested.  During this process, an IP address identifying your computer and the Product and Service version may be sent to a web server along with Usage Information.
