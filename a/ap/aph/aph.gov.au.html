      <h2>Privacy and <a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a> Statement<br>
      </h2>
      <h2><br>
        Privacy</h2>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>This statement applies to all users who access the Parliament of Australia 
        Web Site. </p>
      <h3>General </h3>
      <p>The Parliament of Australia Web Site makes some use of data that only 
        indirectly identifies users. We take great care with practices that affect 
        personal privacy. As a general rule, we do not collect or record data 
        that directly identifies users. </p>
      <h3>Data Collection </h3>
      <p>Data that indirectly identifies users is gathered during interactions 
        with the Parliament of Australia Web Site in the following circumstances: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b class="greytext">Computer Information</b><br>
          It is necessary that your web browser provides your machine's network 
          address, so the web server can address its replies back to the correct 
          machine. In addition, the browser type and operating system information 
          may be recorded. </li>
        <li><b class="greytext">Navigation and Click-Stream Data</b><b><br>
          </b>Browsing any web site generates a trail of pages visited, the amount 
          of data transferred and the time of access. This information is recorded 
          against the network address supplied by your web browser. </li>
        <li><b class="greytext">Electronic Mail</b><b><br>
          </b>It is a necessary part of electronic mail that a sender and receiver 
          address is supplied. These are recorded as well as a message identifier, 
          amount of data and the time. The address you supply as sender is only 
          a pseudonym and may possibly bear no relation to your real name, so 
          is not considered as directly identifying you. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Forms</h3>
      <p>If you use forms on the site to provide information, register interest, 
        or purchase publications, the information you provide is not retained 
        on the public web server and will not be used for purposes other than 
        that for which it was provided.</p>
      <p>We will only record your e-mail address if you send us a message. It 
        will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided and will not 
        be added to a mailing list unless that is the purpose of the message. 
        We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not 
        disclose it without your consent. </p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Data Storage, Retention, Use and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>The data referred to above is generated by the systems you are accessing, 
        and stored in system logs. These logs are preserved and archived for possible 
        future use. </p>
      <p>The data is used by Parliament of Australia Web Site software, and by 
        our support staff, only for </p>
      <ul>
        <li>web site and systems administration, including monitoring as a security 
          measure</li>
        <li>customisation of the web site to meet your needs</li>
        <li>evaluation, research and development. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data collected will not be disclosed to a third party except where 
        it is legally required, such as in the investigation of a criminal offence, 
        and in compliance with a search warrant or subpoena. </p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>A cookie is a very small text file placed onto your computer when you 
        visit a Web site. A cookie can be 'persistent' (meaning that it is written 
        to a permanent file on your hard disk) or 'session-only' (in which case 
        the cookie is deleted at the end of your browsing session). </p>
      <p>Cookies are not generally used on the Parliament's site. The exception 
        to this is the search facility, which has been built to use only temporary 
        'session ID' cookies. One cookie is created at the beginning of the user's 
        search session and discarded at its conclusion. The cookie is not used 
        to collect or store any information about the user, only to allocate a 
        temporary identifier to the search session. </p>
      <p>Without such a session ID, the user would lose the entire search context 
        each time a new web page is visited during a search session e.g. by viewing 
        a document retrieved by a search. If cookies are disabled, the search 
        program could not provide more than a very basic functionality - far less 
        than is expected by our users. </p>
      <p>Our live broadcasts do not use cookies. </p>
      <h3>User Feedback * </h3>
      <p>
        We seek feedback from our users in order to improve the service offered 
        by the site. Answering feedback questions is voluntary and does not in 
        any way affect your access to the Parliament website. <br>
        Parliament records the information requested on the online forms in a 
        database. The information will only be used for the purpose for which 
        it was requested and will not be distributed further, or disclosed, without 
        your consent. <br>
        * Note <br>
        Our agency recognises that there can be risks associated with the transmission 
        of information over the internet. </p>
      <h3>Links to other sites</h3>
      <p>This site contains links to other sites. The Parliament is not responsible 
        for the privacy practice or the content of such web sites. </p>
      <h3>Accountability</h3>
      <p>Parliamentary staff comply with information privacy principles. </p>
      <h3><a href="access/access.htm">Accessing files on the site</a></h3>
      <h2><a name="accessibility"></a>Accessibility <a name="accessibility"></a></h2>
      <p>We are committed to making the Parliament of Australia Web Site fully 
        accessible to the public, including people with disabilities or technical 
        constraints (such as older browsers and low speed Internet connections). 
        In order to achieve this we endeavour to keep the site at the World Wide 
        Web Consortium (W3C) Level A conformance rating for accessibility. Documents 
        which are sometimes displayed on the site in PDF format alone are able 
        to be obtained in more accessible formats by requesting such from the 
        relevant contact on the particular page. Any problems locating suitable 
        formats should be directed to the <a href="mailto:webmanager@aph.gov.au">Parliamentary 
        Web Manager</a></p>
      <p>The Parliament of Australia Web Site is regularly tested for accessibility 
        and all new website contracts include accessibility as a key performance 
        measure.</p>
      <p>Comments on the accessibility of the Parliament of Australia Web Site 
        are welcome and can be sent by email to the <a href="mailto:webmanager@aph.gov.au">Parliamentary 
        Web Manager</a> . </p>
      <p>In particular, if you are having a problem accessing the site, please 
        let us know.<br>
        <br>
