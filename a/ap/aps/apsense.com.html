<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<br>

<font face="verdana" size="-1">
		PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</font><p>
		<font face="verdana" size="-1">This site is owned and operated by 
		Apsense.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance 
		to us. At Apsense.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and 
		safe.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Because we gather certain types of 
		information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our 
		policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of 
		that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we 
		gather and how we use it.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">INFORMATION Apsense.COM GATHERS AND 
		TRACKS</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com gathers two types of 
		information about users:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="verdana" size="-1">Information that users provide 
			through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary 
			submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in 
			our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from 
			participation in polls and surveys:<br>
			<br>
			Information Apsense.com gathers 
			through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying 
			page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to 
			better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our 
			advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our 
			audience. Because Apsense.com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships 
			and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is 
			essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no 
			circumstances does Apsense.com divulge any information about an 
			individual user to a third party. </font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com Gathers User Information In 
		The Following Processes:</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Optional Voluntary Information</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We offer the following free services, 
		which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information 
		by users:</font></p>
		<h2><font face="verdana" size="-1"><em>Privacy Policy Sample</em></font></h2>
		<p><em><font face="verdana" size="-1">The following is a list of 
		different policies which can be edited to remove the parts of the policy 
		that are not needed. You should also add anything to this <strong>policy 
		template</strong> that you may have on your site.</font></em></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">1. Electronic newsletters policy 
		(Dispatches)</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We will offer a free electronic 
		newsletter to users. Apsense.com gathers the email addresses of users who 
		voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing 
		list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points 
		users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to 
		the newsletters at the time of registration.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">2. Message boards/forums policy</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Users of the site's Message Boards and 
		Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of 
		charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to 
		visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a 
		username, password, and email address.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">3. "E-mail this to a friend" policy</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Our site users can choose to 
		electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by 
		clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email 
		address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only 
		in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient 
		know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other 
		purpose.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">4. Polling</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We may offer interactive polls to 
		users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see 
		what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other 
		responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any 
		particular user. Apsense.com may use a system to "tag" users after they 
		have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This 
		tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">5. Surveys</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com may occasionally conduct 
		user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes 
		share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our 
		sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
		information about specific individuals with any third party.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="verdana" size="-1"><em>Privacy Policy Template changes</em></font></h2>
		<p><em><font face="verdana" size="-1">The policy clause about children 
		below is becoming more important as it is nearly impossible to tell the 
		age of any visitor. We recommend adding this sample line to all your 
		forms that request information.</font></em></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Children</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Consistent with the Federal Children's 
		Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly 
		request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 
		13 without requesting parental consent.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Usage tracking</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com tracks user traffic patterns 
		throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this 
		information with data about individual users. Apsense.com does break down 
		overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser 
		type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string 
		(information contained in every user's browser).</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com sometimes tracks and 
		catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but 
		this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking 
		information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't 
		like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
		users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps 
		us continue to build a better service for you.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Cookies</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We may place a text file called a 
		"cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does 
		not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate 
		your use of this site to information that you have specifically and 
		knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can 
		contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off 
		your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Apsense.com 
		uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
		advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad 
		impressions and click rates.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">You can refuse cookies by turning them 
		off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before 
		accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each 
		cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. 
		However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, 
		forums, polling and surveys.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="verdana" size="-1"><em>Privacy Policy Use</em></font></h2>
		<p><em><font face="verdana" size="-1">How the information you gather is 
		used if relevant.</font></em></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">USE OF INFORMATION</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com uses any information 
		voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our 
		network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized 
		elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the 
		interests of our users.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">As stated above, we use information 
		that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic 
		newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, 
		message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a 
		regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send 
		out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly 
		interested in something we are doing. Apsense.com never shares newsletter 
		mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or 
		partners.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">When we use tracking information to 
		determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on 
		traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but 
		rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to 
		build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search 
		function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we 
		don't track which terms a particular user enters.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com creates aggregate reports 
		on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and 
		partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and 
		allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their 
		needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an 
		advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their 
		ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user 
		except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to 
		protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com uses the above-described 
		information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our 
		advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is 
		essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information 
		about individual users with any third party, except to comply with 
		applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety 
		of our users or the public.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">SECURITY</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">Apsense.com operates secure data 
		networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection 
		systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and 
		enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the 
		information provided by our customers.</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">OPT-OUT POLICY</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">We give users options wherever 
		necessary and practical. Such choices include:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="verdana" size="-1"><b>Opting not to register to 
			receive our electronic newsletters.<br>
			<br>
			Opting not to participate in 
			certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to 
			gather any personally identifiable information from our users </b></font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">YOUR CONSENT</font></p>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="-1">By using this site, you consent to the 
		collection and use of this information by Apsense.com. If we decide to 
		change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so 
		that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
		and under what circumstances we disclose it.</font>
