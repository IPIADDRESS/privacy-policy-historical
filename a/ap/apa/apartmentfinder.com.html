        <section class="content">
            <p>Network Communications, Inc. is committed to safeguarding your privacy
                online whenever you use any of our Websites, including (but not limited to)
                ApartmentFinder.com. We encourage you to review the following Privacy Policy
                so that you may understand how your personal information will be treated as you
                make full use of our many offerings.</p>

            <strong>What personally identifiable information about me do you collect?</strong>
            <p>We may collect different types of information in several different ways from our
                Websites.</p>

            <p>You may browse our Websites without submitting any personal information. We
                may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to)
                when you request information about a property, enter a sweepstakes, contest,
                or promotion sponsored by us or one of our partners or you may provide us with
                personal information when you send us a letter or email message, such as if you
                report a problem with our Websites or services. If you contact us, we may keep a
                record of that correspondence.</p>

            <p>From time to time, we also may ask visitors to complete surveys that we use for
                research purposes. Wherever we collect personal information, the information
                you provide will be subject to the terms of this Policy. In addition, we may use
                IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement,
                and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

            <p>Finally, our sites also may contain links and advertisements to other Websites
                that are operated by other companies or persons. Therefore, we do not
                control the privacy policies of those sites. This Policy statement only applies to
                information collected and maintained by us.</p>

            <strong>What are cookies and how do you use them?</strong>
            <p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, we
                use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is
                a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and
                stored on your computer's hard drive. Some of these cookie files will be stored
                on your hard drive even after you close your browser and other files may be
                temporary files that will be deleted when you close your Internet browser. We
                will not, however, attempt to read any cookies or files that may be on your
                computer, including cookies that may have been placed on your computer by
                other Websites that you may have visited.</p>

            <strong>Generally, we use cookies to:</strong>
            <p>(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your information in order to permit
                the tailoring of the Websites to better match your interests and/or preferences.
                These cookies will be stored on your computer and may be modified while you browse our sites.<br>
                (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing one of our Websites is
                given a unique cookie that is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage,
                usage by a visitors, and to help target our services and advertisements based on
                your interests and behavior.<br>
                (3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions,
                sweepstakes, and contests. When one of the promotions that we host uses
                cookies, the information written to the cookie may be used to indicate the player's
                progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions,
                and status in prize drawings.<br>
                (4) Measure certain traffic patterns, such as which areas of our Websites
                you have visited and your visiting patterns. This information, however, is only
                gathered in aggregate form - that is, this aggregated information is not linked
                to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use this
                research to understand how our visitors' habits are similar or different from one
                another so that we can make each new experience on our sites a better one.
                We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and
                promotions that you and other visitors will see on our sites.</p>

            <strong>Third Party Advertisers and Cookies</strong>
            <p>We use third-party companies to serve ads when you visit our Websites. These
                companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
                address or telephone number) about your visits to our Websites in order to
                provide advertisements on our Websites, other sites and other forms of media
                about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more
                information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
                information used by these companies, please click here.</p>

            <strong>How do you use my information?</strong>
            <p>Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable and other information is to
                provide you, the visitor, with a customized experience on our Websites. This
                includes personalization services and many other types of services. By knowing
                a little about you, we are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and
                content, and hence a better and more valuable service, to you. For example, the
                more we know about the type of home or community in which you are interested,
                the more appropriate information we can deliver to you.</p>

            <p>In addition, we do research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and
                behavior based on the information provided to us when requesting more
                information, during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys. We
                do this to better understand and serve our visitors. This research is compiled
                and analyzed on an aggregated basis and may be shared with advertisers or
                business partners.</p>

            <strong>Who besides you is collecting my information?</strong>
            <p>When you are on any of our Websites and are asked for personal information,
                you are sharing that information with us alone, unless it is specifically stated
                otherwise. Some of our services, however, may be offered in conjunction
                with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it
                may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner
                company. For example, if you want to receive information about an apartment
                from a community, we may send your personally identifiable information to that
                community so that it can fulfill your request.</p>

            <p>In addition, promotions that run on our Websites also may be sponsored by
                companies other than us or may be co-sponsored by us and another company.
                Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor.
                If data from your entry will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data
                collection. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want to
                share your information.</p>

            <strong>What happens when I click on a link from one of your sites?</strong>
            <p>As a convenience, our Websites contain links and advertisements to other sites
                that may not be controlled by, or affiliated or associated with, us. Accordingly,
                we do not make any representations concerning the privacy practices or terms
                of use of such sites, nor do we control or guarantee the accuracy, integrity,
                or quality of the information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs,
                graphics, video, messages, or other materials available on such sites. We
                encourage you to view the privacy policy and terms of use of any sites that you
                may visit. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of links or advertisements on
                our sites does not imply any endorsement by us of the sites, the site's provider,
                or the information on the sites.</p>

            <p>Specifically, please be aware that our partners, advertisers, and other Websites
                that have links on our sites may collect personally identifiable information about
                you. The information practices of those partners, advertisers, and other Websites
                linked to our sites are not covered by this Policy.</p>

            <strong>With whom do you share my information?</strong>
            <p>As a general rule, we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
                information except when we have your permission or under special
                circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or
                as specifically set forth in this Policy. Please see the Terms of Use for each of
                our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal
                information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your
                information may be disclosed.</p>

            <p>Many promotions also may offer opportunities for you to request additional
                information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give us
                permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill
                your request.</p>

            <p>From time to time, you may request specific information about a property or you
                may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third
                parties. If you opt to receive information from these third parties, we will share
                your name, address, telephone number, if requested by you or provided, and
                email address with them and our local representatives.</p>

            <p>Third Party Data and Aggregated Data: Under confidentiality agreements, we
                may match visitor information with third-party data. Also, we disclose aggregated
                visitor statistics (for example, "25% of our visitors use mobile devices") in order to
                describe our services to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other
                third parties, and for other lawful purposes. As noted above, this aggregated
                information will not be linked to any personally identifiable information that can
                identify any individual person.</p>

            <p>Other: We may also disclose your personally identifiable information in special
                cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
                necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be
                violating our Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either
                intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, the rights of our visitors or
                other parties, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may
                disclose or access your personally identifiable information when we believe in
                good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that
                we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
                We also may disclose your personally identifiable information in connection with
                the sale of our company's business or assets.</p>

            <strong>What are my choices regarding your collection, use, and distribution of my
                information?</strong>
            <p>We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services.
                In addition, if you indicated upon requesting more information that you are
                interested in receiving offers or information from our partners and us, we may
                occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may
                be of interest to you. Only we (or companies with whom we contract and who
                agree to keep your information confidential) will prepare these direct mailings
                and only if you indicated that you do not object to receiving these offers. If you
                do not want to receive or continue receiving such mailings, simply tell us at

            <p>On some of our promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update
                you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate
                in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email,
                unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally
                these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.
                You may also be required to provide personally identifiable information to collect
                your prize when you win one of our promotions or contests.</p>

            <p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your Internet
                browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
                when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies
                you may be unable to use some of our services, including services that require
                registration in order to participate.</p>

            <p>If you are participating in one of our promotions and you wish to update your
                email address for the promotions mailing list or to stop participating in one of the
                promotions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@apartmentfinder.com">webmaster@apartmentfinder.com</a>.</p>

            <strong>How do you protect my personal financial information?</strong>
            <p>Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us.
                Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you
                better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally
                identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties except
                as set forth in this Policy. Any visitor statistics that we may provide to prospective
                advertisers or partners regarding financial information are provided in the
                aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information linked
                to any individual visitor.</p>

            <strong>What about my child's privacy?</strong>
            <p>The safety of children is very important to us. We maintain general audience
                Websites that are designed for use by adults and that comply with the Children's
                Online Privacy Protection Act. Specifically, we do not knowingly collect
                information from visitors under age 13.</p>

            <p>We encourage parents to create a safe place for children on the Internet.
                Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering
                services) are commercially available that may assist parents in limiting access
                to content that may be harmful to minors. We also encourage parents to monitor
                their child's use of the Internet and teach them not to disclose any personally
                identifiable information (including their age, appearance, school, grade, etc.)
                about themselves in emails, chat rooms, or on other sites, except with your
                knowledge and approval.</p>

            <strong>Where can you get additional information about us or our Websites?</strong>
