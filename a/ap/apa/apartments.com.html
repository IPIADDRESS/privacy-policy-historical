        information available on this site, and is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or

        IN HOUSING STATEMENT </font></p>
        </b><p><b><font color="#99CC33">Our Policy</font></b></p>
        <p>All real estate advertised herein is subject to the federal Fair Housing Act, which
        makes it illegal to advertise "any preference, limitation, or discrimination because
        of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or intention
        to make such preference, limitation or discrimination."</p>
        <p>We will not knowingly accept or permit any advertisement for real estate that is in
        violation of the law. All persons are hereby informed that all dwellings advertised are
        available on an equal opportunity basis.</p>
        <b></b><p><b><font color="#99CC33">The Law</font></b></p>
        <p>When it comes to buying, selling or leasing a home or renting an apartment, several
        state and federal laws were enacted to ensure the equal opportunity in housing for all
        people. </p>
        <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibits all racial discrimination in the sale or rental
        of property. Moreover, the Fair Housing Act declares a national policy of fair housing
        throughout the United States, making illegal any discrimination in the sale, lease or
        rental of housing, or making housing otherwise unavailable, because of race, color,
        religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.</p>
        <p>Other laws also impact the purchase, sale or lease of a home or renting an apartment.
        Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against persons
        with disabilities in places of public accommodations and commercial facilities. The Equal
        Credit Opportunity Act makes discrimination unlawful with respect to any aspect of a
        credit application on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital
        status, age or because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public
        assistance program.</p>
        <p>In addition, state and local laws often provide broader coverage and prohibit
        discrimination based on additional classes not covered by federal law.</p>
        <p>As a home seller or landlord you have a responsibility and a requirement under the law
        not to discriminate in the sale, rental and financing of property on the basis of race,
        color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. You cannot instruct
        the licensed broker or salesperson acting as your agent to convey for you any limitations
        in the sale or rental because the real estate professional is bound by law not to
        discriminate. Agents in a real estate transaction also are prohibited by law from
        discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or
        national origin. They are prohibited from complying with a request from the home seller or
        landlord to act in a discriminatory manner in the sale, lease or rental. Moreover, a home
        seller or landlord cannot establish discriminatory terms or conditions in the purchase or
        rental, deny that housing is available, or advertise that the property is available only
        to persons of a certain race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national
        original.</p>
        <p>As someone seeking to purchase a home or rent an apartment, you have the right to
        expect that housing will be available to you without discrimination or other limitations
        based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. This
        includes the right to expect equal professional service, the opportunity to consider a
        broad range of housing choices, no discriminatory limitations on communities or locations
        of housing, no discrimination in the financing, appraising, or insuring of housing,
        reasonable accommodations in rules, practices and procedures for persons with
        disabilities, and to be free from harassment or intimidation for exercising your fair
        housing rights.</p>
