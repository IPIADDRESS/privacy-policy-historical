</font></b><p><font face="CG Omega (WT)" size="2">Apartments.com does not guarantee the accuracy of any information available on this site, and is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or misrepresentations. Product information including availability, features, floor plans and rent ranges are subject to change without prior notice and should be verified independently with the property managers.</font></p><font face="CG Omega (WT)" size="2">

<b><p align="center">EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN HOUSING STATEMENT</p>
<p>Our Policy</p>
</b><p>All real estate advertised herein is subject to the federal Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to advertise "any preference, limitation, or discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin, or intention to make such preference, limitation or discrimination."</p>
<p>We will not knowingly accept or permit any advertisement for real estate that is in violation of the law. All persons are hereby informed that all dwellings advertised are available on an equal opportunity basis.</p>
<b><p>The Law</p>
</b><p>When it comes to buying, selling or leasing a home or renting an apartment, several state and federal laws were enacted to ensure the equal opportunity in housing for all people. The Civil Rights Act of 1966 prohibits all racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property. Moreover, the Fair Housing Act declares a national policy of fair housing throughout the United States, making illegal any discrimination in the sale, lease or rental of housing, or making housing otherwise unavailable, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.</p>

<p>Other laws also impact the purchase, sale or lease of a home or renting an apartment. Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in places of public accommodations and commercial facilities. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act makes discrimination unlawful with respect to any aspect of a credit application on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age or because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program.</p>

<p>In addition, state and local laws often provide broader coverage and prohibit discrimination based on additional classes not covered by federal law.</p>
<p>As a home seller or landlord you have a responsibility and a requirement under the law not to discriminate in the sale, rental and financing of property on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. You cannot instruct the licensed broker or salesperson acting as your agent to convey for you any limitations in the sale or rental because the real estate professional is bound by law not to discriminate. Agents in a real estate transaction also are prohibited by law from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. They are prohibited from complying with a request from the home seller or landlord to act in a discriminatory manner in the sale, lease or rental. Moreover, a home seller or landlord cannot establish discriminatory terms or conditions in the purchase or rental, deny that housing is available, or advertise that the property is available only to persons of a certain race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national original.</p>
<p>As someone seeking to purchase a home or rent an apartment, you have the right to expect that housing will be available to you without discrimination or other limitations based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. This includes the right to expect equal professional service, the opportunity to consider a broad range of housing choices, no discriminatory limitations on communities or locations of housing, no discrimination in the financing, appraising, or insuring of housing, reasonable accommodations in rules, practices and procedures for persons with disabilities, and to be free from harassment or intimidation for exercising your fair housing rights.</p>
