            <h3 align="center"><strong>Information Sharing</strong></h3>
            <p>The Site may  share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties  in the following cases:</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> The Site may share your       personally identifiable information with Affiliates on the condition that       the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with       this Statement. </li>
              <li><strong>Requests.</strong> The Site maintains relationships       with third party providers for some of the products and services offered       through the Site.&nbsp; If you request information or services through the       Site, you agree that the Site may share personally identifiable       information as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform       such services for you. For example, if you request information about a       unit or floor plan for a property advertised on the Site, Apartments.com       will share the information collected through such request with that       property (or its designee) and any other parties providing that listing       (e.g., if a third party management company provides the listing to us on       behalf of the property or our “Feedback” service provider may collect       information and ideas on our behalf).&nbsp; In some cases, the information       that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third       party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third party or       on a page framed with the Site’s branding).&nbsp; Personally identifiable       information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can       respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up       communications. The subsequent use or disclosure of any information       collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy       policies and practices.&nbsp; </li>
              <li>&nbsp;<strong>Sweepstakes/Promotions.</strong> In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other       promotion on the Site that is sponsored by the Site and a third party, we reserve       the right to share personally identifiable information collected in       conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with the third       party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the       subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third       parties’ privacy policies and practices. </li>
              <li><strong>Direct Marketing.</strong> Except as provided herein, it is       the Site’s policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of       our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties' direct       marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have       affirmatively agreed to receive third party direct marketing materials, the       Site may share your personally identifiable information with third parties       for direct marketing purposes. Although the Site will endeavor to notify       all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is       confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of information is subject       to those third parties’ privacy policies and practices. </li>
              <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> The Site works with third       parties that provide services on its behalf.&nbsp; Examples include       providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, Live Chat,       and credit card processing and other services. For example, the Site may       ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send       newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to the Site by       credit card, the Site will share your personally identifiable information       and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit       card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the       credit card processing service provider on the Site’s behalf. In such       cases, the Site requires that the third party maintain your personally       identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to       perform the services specified by the Site and not for their own       promotional purposes. . </li>
              <li><strong>Email List Opt-Outs.</strong> In the event the Site sends       promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform       the Site you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a       particular third party, the Site will share your email address with that       third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists. </li>
              <li><strong>Other.</strong> The Site expressly reserves the       right to release any personally identifiable information or other       information you provide to third parties under the following       circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to       investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse,       or unauthorized use of the Site ’s services, (c) to protect the property       or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and       (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a       part of CV or any of its businesses.&nbsp; If you make any personally       identifiable information publicly available on the Site (e.g., by posting       a listing which contains personally identifiable information), anyone may       see and use such information and Apartments.com is not responsible for       such use.&nbsp; The Site reserves the right to share any personally       identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties with your       prior consent.&nbsp; To the extent the Site does so, the subsequent use       and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and       practices of those third parties.&nbsp; </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that  the messages that the Site sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a  request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from the  Site or its partners. In the case of these messages, the Site is not sharing  your personally identifiable information with those third parties.
