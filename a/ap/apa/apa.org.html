<h2>Cookies</h2>        <div class="forceimagewrap"><div class="wysiwyg"><p>COOKIES ARE USED TO RECOGNIZE USERS WHEN THEY COME BACK TO OUR SITE, TO LEARN ABOUT WHICH PAGES ARE THE MOST VISITED AND TO ASSIST WITH A SINGLE SIGN-ON ACROSS APA DIGITAL ASSETS.</p>
<p>Cookies are text files sent by Web servers to Web browsers and are stored on the user’s computer or mobile device. If the browser is loading a page and the server requests the Data stored in the cookie, the Data contained within the cookie is sent back to the server.</p>
<p>Cookies contain data about the user’s activities on a website and can be used by Web servers to identify and track Users as they navigate different pages on that website and can identify Users returning to that website.</p>
<p>Cookies may be either "persistent" or "session" cookies. APA uses persistent cookies to enable our website to recognize you when you visit or return to an APA Website.&nbsp; Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until you delete them or until it expires automatically at its expiration date. Session cookies are temporary cookies that typically expire at the end of the web browsing session on a website.&nbsp; APA uses session cookies to keep track of you while you navigate APA Digital Assets.&nbsp; A session cookie expires at the end of the user session, i.e. when the Web browser is closed.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How APA uses cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies contain Data that we have previously stored from prior interactions with APA Digital Assets and may allow us to link to other Data we have about you (My APA, previous purchases, subscriptions).</p>
<p>APA Digital Assets use Data we obtain from cookies for the following purposes:</p>

Google will store this Data. More information is available at Google's privacy policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;gl=us.</p>

<li>To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of APA and APA Digital Assets or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</li>
<li>To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</li>
<li>To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical data from our Users and provide such Data to third parties.</li>

<h2>Website Security</h2>        <div class="forceimagewrap"><div class="wysiwyg"><p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Data you transmit to us and you understand that any Data that you transfer to APA is done at your own risk. However, APA uses website security measures consistent with current best practices to protect its website, email and mailing lists. These measures include technical, procedural, monitoring and tracking steps intended to safeguard data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
<p>Credit card data is transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) encryption or Transport Layer Security (“TLS”). Member and purchaser Data is a high priority and we use our own protective measures, as well as the capabilities of our software and hardware vendors.</p>
<p>We realize there can be incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions, as almost every website, service and user encounters. In those instances, our goals are to move quickly to isolate the problem, ensure or restore proper functionality and minimize any inconvenience to our Users. As appropriate and necessary, APA will notify the relevant authorities of these incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions of the APA website.</p></div></div>




<h2>Data Retention</h2>        <div class="forceimagewrap"><div class="wysiwyg"><p>APA retains information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected and to comply with its legal and contractual obligations, plus 3 years, and then securely disposes of that information or converts it into non-personal information by aggregating it, de-identifying it, or otherwise anonymizing it so that it does not directly or indirectly identify you and cannot, with reasonable efforts, resources, and technologies, be used to reidentify you.</p></div></div>
