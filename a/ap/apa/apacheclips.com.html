What Does the Apacheclips Privacy Policy Cover?<br><br>


This privacy policy applies to web pages ending in Apacheclips.com that contain a link to this privacy policy at the bottom of the web page. Inclusion of the Apacheclips logo at the top of a web page does not necessarily mean that this privacy policy applies.

What Information Does Apacheclips Collect From You?<br><br>


You can visit our site and use most of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. There are, however, a few instances where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request.<br><br>

Whenever you visit Apacheclips, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, Apacheclips cookie information, the Apacheclips page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.<br><br>
