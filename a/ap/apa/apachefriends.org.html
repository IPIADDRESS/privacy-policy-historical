        <p>
          As we are located in the USA, any information you provide, will be processed and stored
          in the USA. If you are in the European Union or European Economic Area, this may mean that
          your personal information will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of
          protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal information
          than the jurisdiction you are typically a resident in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, we have entered into guarantees to ensure appropriate safeguards. If we
          transfer information from the European Union to third parties outside the European Union and
          to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data
          protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual
          Clauses with these parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to inquire further about the safeguards we use, please contact us using the
          details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure

            device after you have finished browsing a particular website, until they are deleted or
            until they expire.

            <b>Cookies by third parties:</b>
            Some cookies belong to us and we place them on your device. Other cookies are placed on your
            browsing device by third parties when you visit our websites. Third parties setting cookies
            from our websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do
            not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use cookies to
            help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising
            to you that is relevant to your interests. The advertising industries in the EU have developed a
            scheme to help you opt-out of receiving cookies used for these purposes. You can find out
            more about the EU scheme from

                <b>Google Analytics:</b>
                We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our
                websites or use our Service on your browser or mobile device. Google Analytics facilitates
                the assignment of data, sessions and interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous
                user ID and thus the analysis of activities across devices. We share a unique identifier,
                like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. The generated
                information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As IP
                anonymization is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within the
                Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European
                Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted
                to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser
                in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. Google will use the
                collected data on our behalf to evaluate the use of the websites, to compile reports on
                website activity and to provide the website operator with other services related to website
                and Internet use.
                <br>
                For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can
                control information sent to Google, review Google's site

                browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to
