Privacy Policy
</h3>
<p>
Consumer Source interactive, (CSi), operator of Apartmentguide.com, is comitted to making your search for a new home as pleasant and successful as possible. Maintaining your privacy is a large part of our commitment. We will never disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party without your consent, except in limited circumstances to our business partners with whom we have established agreements that protect your privacy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Here's how we collect and use information from you in our efforts to provide the highest quality user experience:
</strong>
</p>
<h4>
IP Address
</h4>
<p>
Your IP or Internet Protocol address and other site usage data is used to gather broad demographic information. This data helps us serve you by allowing us to understand how visitors use our services.
</p>
<h4>
Cookies
</h4>
<p>
Our site uses a technology called "cookies," small files stored by your browser to help keep track of your user profile. We use temporary cookies to remember your personal profile for your convenience, to deliver content specific to your needs and interests, and to ensure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to track user trends and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable. We do not share cookie information with anyone without your permission.
</p>
<p>
We work with third-party data analytics and online targeting companies. Some of these companies may use anonymous information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide data and targeting recommendations based on which we may provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. To learn more about this practice or about your choice to opt-out of this practice please click
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>
<h4>
Ads
</h4>
<p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click
<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx" class="link" targt="_new">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" class="link" targt="_new">here</a>.
</p>
<h4>
Registration
</h4>
<p>
Apartmentguide.com allows users to access enhanced features by registering on the site. Our registration forms require users to give us contact information (like your name), unique identifiers (such as your email address), and also ask for demographic information (like your Zip code or age). Customer contact information is maintained to make requesting more information from site resources as easy as possible. Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary for administrative purposes related to your account. We use your email as a unique identifier in our record system, to verify communications from you, and we may send you newsletters, promotion offerings or email that you ask to receive or to tell you about changes to the site.
</p>
<h4>
Email Services
</h4>
<p>
If you take advantage of any email features on our sites, you and/or the person you email to may receive email updates as described in the service. All email recipients are afforded the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners.
</p>
<h4>
Order Forms
</h4>
<p>
Our sites use forms for you to request information, products and services and more information from us. Some contact information and unique identifiers are required to process your request. We may also request additional information that we use to improve areas of our site. Guide Book orders are conducted through a secure site managed by a business partner. This partner is audited by a third party Certification Authority.
</p>
<h4>
Your Security
</h4>
<p>
CSi. has taken the following important measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. First, we store no financial information or social security information on our site. The personal data we do store on our system is protected by firewall and password. Our network firewall is a combination of hardware and software designed to keep unauthorized users from accessing our network. The password you select, along with your unique email address, prevents others from accessing your information. We suggest that you do not disclose your password to anyone.
</p>
<h4>
Third Party Service Providers
</h4>
<p>
Some of the services available are provided by third parties that have their own privacy policies that may be different than ours. You should review the privacy policy of third parties before providing your personal information to them.
</p>
<h4>
Outside Links
</h4>
<p>
While on Apartmentguide.com, you may be led to other web sites. Be aware that other sites may collect data and personal information and operate according to their own privacy practices. Please remember that, once outside of our family of sites, any information you submit is outside of our control.
</p>
<h4>
Disclosure
</h4>
<p>
To provide you the best products and services, we team with business partners. When you indicate that you want to receive a product or service, or contact a person or organization, we share the data needed for you to receive what you have indicated. Occasionally, we hire consultants that may need access to our member database to perform their services for us. We take great care to require that these business partners agree by contract not to use any member information that they may receive access to. CSi may contract with outside companies to administer our mailing lists or provide retail services. Your personal information may be shared with an outside company for the sole purpose of administering the products, services and programs you have selected.
</p>
<h4>
Choice/Opt-out
</h4>
<p>
CSi provides you the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from our partners and us. To remove your personal information, users can send a request via the "Comments" feature and by typing "unsubscribe" in the "Additional Comments" section, or unsubscribe via the â€˜Opt-Outâ€™ link that is included at the bottom of every CSi email you receive.
</p>
<h4>
Correct or Update
</h4>
<p>
You can change or update your personal information for a particular tool by going to your "Edit Profile" section of the site and following instructions to update your information.
</p>
<h4>
Contacting Us
</h4>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy or if at any time you feel that CSi has not adhered to this policy, send a message through the "Comments" feature of Apartmentguide.com and we'll do our best to determine any problem and quickly respond.
</p>
<p>
This privacy policy does not extend to any information that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond the control of CSi, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this policy at any time.
</p>
<p>
CSi and its affiliates may disclose your personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on CSi or its affiliates; (2) protect and defend the property or rights of CSi, and its affiliates or users.
