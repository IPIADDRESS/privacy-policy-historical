								<h4>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
								<p>You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. CV  automatically collects Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site(e.g., the type of apartment you are looking for). We collect personally identifiable information only when you provide it. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services.   In addition, you may submit personally identifiable information in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email (which have opt-out instructions if you wish to unsubscribe); and (c) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the properties that list apartments for rent on the Site. If you dial one of these phone numbers, the Site or a service provider operating on the Site's behalf may record the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement, including for follow up marketing purposes. The types of personally identifiable information collected will depend on the nature of the submission or the features of the Site used, but could include your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event that you purchase an ad in a print/online package through a newspaper Affiliate, the Affiliate is required to share your name, phone number and email address with CV in order to allow us to process and maintain your ad.</p>
								
								<h4>Passive Information Collection</h4>
								<p>The Site automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by computers (or servers) to identify your computer.</li>
									<li><b>Web Beacons:</b> Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, Internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a Web page.</li>
									<li><b>IP Address Logs:</b> CV also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses— the location of your computer on the Internet.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Cookies allow CV to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and Web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows CV to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies, Web beacons and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (what Web site you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Web site did you go to, etc.). This type of tracking does not identify you personally.  Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by the Site to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding usage of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of Apartments.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as "<b>Usage Data</b>."</p>

								<ul style="margin-left:45px;margin-bottom:10px">

									<li>To follow up on any request that you have previously made (e.g., the Site may contact you to determine whether the property owner and/or management company responded to your original request). </li>
									<li>To communicate with you regarding the Site service (e.g., the Site may send you emails or call you to confirm an apartment availability inquiry or to notify you that you have received a lead regarding an apartment you have advertised or to request that you participate in a survey). </li>
									<li>To send promotional materials, newsletters, or other content via email or otherwise, unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive such materials. </li>
									<li>To permit third parties to whom the Site may disclose personally identifiable information specifically for direct marketing purposes to send you promotional or informational messages, but only if you have first affirmatively agreed to receive such messages. </li>
									<li>To improve your user experience. </li>
									<li>To manage its relationships with Affiliates, customers, and other third parties to which the Site may disclose personally identifiable information pursuant to this Statement (e.g., to provide reporting to Affiliates and customers, to provide customer support, and to resolve disputes). </li>
									<li>For Site administration, analysis, research, development, optimization and other internal purposes, including, without limitation, to compile Usage Data.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>Usage Data:</b> Usage Data is used by the Site for administrative, analytical, research, optimization and other purposes. For example, the Site may use statistical analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Site, for development purposes and to inform advertisers and partners in aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages. IP Addresses are also used for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.</p>
								<p>With respect to promotional materials and newsletters that the Site may send via email from time to time, the Site will not continue to send you such communications if you ask us not to by following the unsubscribe instructions in each promotional email from the Site or by a request sent to <a href="movinghelp@apartments.com">movinghelp@apartments.com</a>. However, you agree that the Site may send to you, and you cannot opt out of, communications of a transactional or relationship nature, including, but not limited to, communications regarding fraudulent or illegal activity, account status, changes to this Statement or the Site's Terms of Service, as well as communications to confirm, fulfill and follow up on your registration, service or a request submitted through the Site. </p>
								
								<h4>Information Sharing</h4>
								<p>The Site may share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties in the following cases:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Affiliates.</b> The Site may share your personally identifiable information with Affiliates on the condition that the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with this Statement. 
									</li><li><b>Requests.</b> The Site maintains relationships with third party providers for some of the products and services offered through the Site.  If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that the Site may share personally identifiable information as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you. For example, if you request information about a unit or floor plan for a property advertised on the Site, Apartments.com will share the information collected through such request with that property (or its designee) and any other parties providing that listing (e.g., if a third party management company provides the listing to us on behalf of the property or our "Feedback" service provider may collect information and ideas on our behalf).  In some cases, the information that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third party or on a page framed with the Site's branding).  Personally identifiable information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up communications. The subsequent use or disclosure of any information collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy policies and practices. </li>
									<li><b>Sweepstakes/Promotions.</b> In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion on the Site that is sponsored by the Site and a third party, we reserve the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with the third party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices. </li>
									<li><b>Direct Marketing.</b> Except as provided herein, it is the Site's policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have affirmatively agreed to receive third party direct marketing materials, the Site may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although the Site will endeavor to notify all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of information is subject to those third parties' privacy policies and practices. </li>
									<li><b>Service Providers.</b> The Site works with third parties that provide services on its behalf.  Examples include providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, Live Chat, and credit card processing and other services. For example, the Site may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to the Site by credit card, the Site will share your personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on the Site's behalf. In such cases, the Site requires that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by the Site and not for their own promotional purposes. . </li>
									<li><b>Email List Opt-Outs.</b> In the event the Site sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform the Site you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, the Site will share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists. </li>
									<li><b>Other.</b> The Site expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable information or other information you provide to third parties under the following circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse, or unauthorized use of the Site 's services, (c) to protect the property or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a part of CV or any of its businesses.

The Site reserves the right to share any personally identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties with your prior consent.  To the extent the Site does so, the subsequent use and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third parties.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Please note that the messages that the Site sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from the Site or its partners. In the case of these messages, the Site is not sharing your personally identifiable information with those third parties.
