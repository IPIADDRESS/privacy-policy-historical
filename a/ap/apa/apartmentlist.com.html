This statement governs information you provide to us or that we learn from you and other users of the Service (collectively, "Users") through use of the Service, and describes how we may collect, use, and disclose this information.</p>
<h2>
The Information Company Collects
</h2>
<p>
<strong>

</strong>
You may provide to Company what is generally called "personally identifiable" information when you register or use the Service, such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number, as well as a variety of other personal information such as information about your demographic profile and interests.  Any time you enter information into a form or other data entry field available on the Service, Company collects and stores any personal information you include.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Aggregate Data.
</strong>
Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed.

</p>
<p>
<strong>
"Cookies" Information.
</strong>
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Company uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. By using these cookies, we can "remember" what you have done on the Service before and personalize our site for you. These persistent types of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality available via the Service.
</p>
<p>
<strong>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
Third-Party Marketing.
</strong>

</p>
<h2>
Advertising and Remarketing
</h2>
<p>
Company may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further, these advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for Company products and services) based on information collected from you while using the Service.  For example, Company uses Google’s “remarketing” service to target Company ads to you based on your prior use of the Service when you visit on other sites in Google’s content network.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to users based on a certain audience or audience segment.  If you respond to this type of targeted advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
</p>
<p>
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Company's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers or other websites.
</p>
<h2>
Links to Other Sites
</h2>
<p>
The Service may contain links or references to external websites. These are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the privacy or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites before providing them with personal information.
</p>
<h2>
Our Commitment to Data Security
</h2>
<p>
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, which may include use of industry standard technologies and procedures. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.
</p>
<p>

By using the Service or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. Company may post a notice on the Service if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the Service. Company may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
