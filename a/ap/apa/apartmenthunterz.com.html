<h2 id="privacy-info">What personally identifiable information is collected from you</h2>

<p>The Apartment Hunters collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.</p>

<p>Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the Vacancy posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Apartment Hunters - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the Apartment Hunters.</p>

<p>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place vacancies or take advantage of the other features of the Apartment Hunters. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the Apartment Hunters includes a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>


<h2 id="privacy-cookies">What cookies are and how they are used</h2>

<p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, the Apartment Hunters may use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Several features of the Apartment Hunters require that you accept cookies in order to work properly. (See <a href="#choice">"What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information"</a> for more information on cookies.)</p>

<p>Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>To identify and label all "new" vacancies since your last visit to the site.</li>

<li>Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.</li>

<li>To enable you to "checklist and compare" vacancies that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Third party advertising networks that serve vacancies onto the Apartment Hunters may also use their own cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

<p>The Apartment Hunters may also collect <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html">IP addresses</a> for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers to let us know what features are effective.</p>

</p>


<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-sharing">With whom your information may be shared</h2>

<p>As a general rule, Apartment Hunters will not disclose any of your personally
    identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special
    circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.</p>

<p>Apartment Hunters may disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Terms of Service of the Apartment Hunters or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of the Apartment Hunters, other users of the Apartment Hunters, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Apartment Hunters may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
If Apartment Hunters is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.  We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>


<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-choices">What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information</h2>

<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of the Apartment Hunters, but you will not be able to access areas or use features that require registration.</p>

<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.

These services include the identification of new vacancies that have been posted since your last visit, auto-fillin of the logon form, and the Comparison Shopper feature. You can still use most of the features of the Apartment Hunters even if you do not accept cookies.</p>

<p>The Apartment Hunters does not sell, rent or trade user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.

<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-edit">How you can access, update or delete your information</h2>

<p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the "My Profile" link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in. Once you have logged onto the system during a given session, wherever you go on the Apartment Hunters, your information will stay with you until or unless you click on the "Logoff" link, which is accessible from within the "My Profile" screen.</p>

<p>If you are a previously registered user and you have lost or forgotten your password, you may obtain it by email by using our "Forgot Password" feature. Click the button on any login page to request that your password be emailed to you. We cannot provide your password by any other means.</p>

<p>Your Apartment Hunters account can be deleted, but doing so will result in not being able to access any of the features of the program that require user registration.</p>

<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-security">The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information</h2>

<p>Other than the administrator of the Apartment Hunters or other authorized personnel of the Apartment Hunters, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Apartment Hunters will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the Apartment Hunters. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>

<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Apartment Hunters cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>

<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-children">How Apartment Hunters protects children's privacy</h2>

<p>Apartment Hunters is a general audience web site. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.
 Apartment Hunters does not knowingly collect information from anyone under 13 years of age.  If we find that we have mistakenly collected information from a child we will take the necessary steps to delete the information immediately.  If you feel that we have collected information from a user under the age of 13 please contact us and we will delete it.
</p>

<a href="#nav-privacy">↑&nbsp;back to top</a>




<h2 id="privacy-general">Changes to this privacy policy</h2>

<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
