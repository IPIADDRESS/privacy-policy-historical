<p class="header">Online Privacy Policy</p>
        <p class="front_story">The APPEAL-DEMOCRAT Web site is maintained by APPEAL-DEMOCRAT, 
          1530 Ellis Lake Drive , Marysville, CA. 95901. We can be reached by 
          e-mail at <a href="mailto:appeal@syix.com">appeal@syix.com</a> </p>
        <p><span class="sub-head">HOW APPEAL-DEMOCRAT USES INFORMATION PROVIDED 
          BY YOU:<br>
          </span> <span class="front_story">This site does not collect personally 
          identifiable information about individuals except when specifically 
          and knowingly provided by such individuals. A user's personally identifiable 
          information may be used by APPEAL-DEMOCRAT and its affiliates for editorial 
          purposes. APPEAL-DEMOCRAT may also use such information for marketing 
          and promotional purposes. We may share your personally identifiable 
          information with other companies with which we conduct business. For 
          example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail 
          services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services 
          to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable 
          information to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through our 
          commerce site, we will forward your information to third parties for 
          credit card processing and order fulfillment. We also sometimes provide 
          your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you 
          that meet your needs. While APPEAL-DEMOCRAT will seek to require such 
          third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize 
          them to use this information except for the express purpose for which 
          it was provided, APPEAL-DEMOCRAT does not bear any responsibility for 
          any actions or policies of any third parties. </span></p>
        <p class="front_story">Except for purposes outlined above, we do not provide, 
          sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third 
          parties, unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. If you have 
          any questions or concerns regarding what is done with your information 
          on any part of APPEAL-DEMOCRAT, please e-mail us at appeal@ syix.com, 
          before submitting any information. </p>
        <p class="front_story">We also collect anonymous, aggregated data and 
          provide it to our advertisers and other companies that we do business 
          with for market research and statistical purposes. For example, we might 
          report to our advertisers that a certain percentage of users are between 
          the ages of 30-35. </p>
        <p class="front_story">Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily 
          disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., first and last name, 
          address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that 
          information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited 
          messages from other posters or parties. </p>
        <p><span class="sub-head">COOKIES:</span><br>
          <span class="front_story">APPEAL-DEMOCRAT may place a "cookie" 
          in the browser files of APPEAL-DEMOCRAT user's computer. The cookie 
          may contain personally identifiable information. Cookies enable APPEAL-DEMOCRAT 
          to serve information that you have requested, or that relate to your 
          use of APPEAL-DEMOCRAT to information that you have specifically and 
          knowingly provided to APPEAL-DEMOCRAT. You also may occasionally get 
          cookies from our advertisers. APPEAL-DEMOCRAT does not control these 
          cookies and these cookies are not subject to this policy. The use of 
          advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is common in the Internet 
          industry. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you 
          prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when 
          cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some portions of 
          APPEAL-DEMOCRAT will not function properly if you do so. For further 
          information on cookies and their use, see the help instructions delivered 
          with your browser or contact the browser's manufacturer. APPEAL-DEMOCRAT 
          cannot provide help regarding your browser's cookie settings. </span></p>
        <p><span class="sub-head">CHILDREN:</span> <br>
          <span class="front_story">Be sure to ask your parents for permission 
          before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, 
          e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet, and before 
          making any purchases online. </span></p>
        <p><span class="sub-head">PARENTS:</span> <br>
          <span class="front_story">We encourage you to get involved with your 
          children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they 
          are participating. Any personally identifiable information collected 
          by APPEAL-DEMOCRAT from children (that we are aware are children) will 
          be used only for APPEAL-DEMOCRAT internal purposes such as market research, 
          sweepstakes fulfillment and for fulfilling requests for information 
          or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. However, 
          such information will not be posted or published by us, or provided 
          to any third parties, without your prior consent. Additionally, anonymous 
          aggregated data is sometimes provided to other companies which we do 
          business with, for statistical and market research purposes as described 
          above. Finally, you should be aware that if your child voluntarily discloses 
          his name, e-mail address, etc. on various forums, or chat areas, such 
          disclosure may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, 
          you should discourage your child from doing so. </span></p>
        <p><span class="front_story">Again, if you have any concerns regarding 
          your child's or your use of APPEAL-DEMOCRAT, please contact us at <a href="mailto:appeal@syix.com">appeal@syix.com</a></span><br>
