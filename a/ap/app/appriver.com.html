 <h1>AppRiver Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>AppRiver places the privacy, security and protection of our customers (and prospective customers) data and information as our number one priority. Because AppRiver wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, we have disclosed our information collection and management practices on this page. </p>


<p>If you should have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please contact customer support at <a href="mailto:support@appriver.com">support@appriver.com</a> or 850-932-5338, 1101 Gulf Breeze Pkwy, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>AppRiver is the ABSOLUTE SOLE OWNER of the information collected on www.appriver.com with NO EXCEPTIONS. We do NOT and will NOT share ANY information from our customers (or prospective customers) to any third party.</p>

<h2>One Time Email Address Usage </h2>

<p>AppRiver does <strong>NOT</strong> send out email marketing about any of our products. We will NOT add your email address to ANY sort of monthly newsletters or email promotions. All email communications are one time and are only pertinent to customer service related issues.</p>

<h2>Demo Request and Additional Information Forms</h2>
<p>In order to obtain service from AppRiver a user may be required to first complete an information request form. On that request form a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. This information will NEVER be shared with any third party.</p>

<h2>Ordering Forms</h2>
<p>We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used strictly for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.</p>

<h2>Information Use</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Communications from the Site</h2>
<h3>Service Announcements</h3>
<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if we add additional features or discontinue features to our service we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.</p>

<h2>Third Party Intermediaries</h2>
<p>AppRiver uses an outside company for credit card processing to bill users for services. These companies do NOT retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, AppRiver LLC, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>AppRiver takes every precaution to protect our user's information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our payment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just'surfing'.</p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing personnel or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must lock their workstations when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every month as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in an extremely secure and restricted environment. <strong>Only authorized personnel with military-grade pass cards and that are identified by biometric hand scanners have access to these secure areas where the servers are housed.</strong></p>

<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@appriver.com">support@appriver.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Supplementation of Information</h2>
<h3>Address Verification</h3>
<p>We use the local directory information services to verify a user's address and to verify that the company applying for our service is indeed who they claim to be. </p>

<h2>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Account Information</h2>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user's personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:support@appriver.com">support@appriver.com</a>. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>

<p>If, however, we are going to use user's personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
