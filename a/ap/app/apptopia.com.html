We are sensitive to your concerns about how we use the personal information we collect from someone that accesses, browses, or in any way uses the Services (“You”, “you”, or “User”) through Apptopia.com website(s), domains, Applications, or any of its Services (the “Site”). We have implemented this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) and practices to keep your personal information secure, and it describes how we collect and use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use.

We also collect a variety of non-identifying visitor data, much of it automatically, such as IP addresses, browser settings and history, ISP information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, search inquiries, and clickstream data (collectively “Non-Personal Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to measure users’ activity on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically collected data to PII.
