            <hr>
            <p class="bigger">Apptopia’s exchange helps broker the sale of mobile apps.  By “sale”, we mean selling &amp; transferring ownership, code, users, revenues, etc.</p>
            <hr>
            <ul class="icons">
                <li class="tools">
                    <h3>Simple &amp; Easy to Use</h3>
                    <p>Every day we strive to make this entire process as easy as possible for you.  One of the first ways we do that is by providing app valuation tools for sellers, and a search platform for buyers that makes it very simple &amp; intuitive to navigate our inventory.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="chart">
                    <h3> We Help You Make Money</h3>
                    <p>Our platform represents a new way for people to make money in mobile.  For the first time mobile app developers now have a legitimate exit strategy.  On the same note buyers (who may or may not be technical) now have an actual channel to invest in mobile (that isn’t buying Apple stock…).</p>
