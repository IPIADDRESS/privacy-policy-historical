		</p><h4 class="norm-2">Introduction</h4> 
<p></p><p class="norm">Appcelerator, Inc., and its affiliates (“Appcelerator”, “us”, “our” or “we”) are dedicated to protecting the privacy rights of our developers (“Developers” or “you”) and their end users (“End Users”).  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect from you or from your End Users in connection with our website at www.appcelerator.com (the “Site”) and in connection with Appcelerator’s products (collectively, the “Service”).  Personal information can include, for example, an individual’s first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or credit card number.  Please note that the scope of this Policy is limited to information collected or received by Appcelerator through your use of the Service.  Appcelerator is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer.  Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.</p>

<p class="norm">We may update this Policy from time to time.  You are responsible for periodically reading this Policy. We will post all changes to this Policy on this page and the modified policy will specify its effective date.</p>

<h4 class="norm-2">How We Collect Information</h4>

<p class="norm"><strong>Website</strong><br>
When you visit our Site, your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language and referring Web site addresses may be logged automatically.  We may also collect information about your usage and activity, such as number of clicks, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity.  We may use this information to monitor and analyze your use of the Service.</p>
<p class="norm"><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
Appcelerator uses “cookies” to keep and occasionally track information. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate within the Site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  We set a persistent cookie to store your password if you choose “auto login”, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. We also store your display resolution and whether JavaScript is enabled in your browser to enhance your user experience.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.  However, removing cookies may result in you not being able to take full advantage of the features of the Service.   
We may feature advertisements served by third party advertisers that deliver cookies to your computer so the advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertisers associate your computer with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement.  These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  This Policy does not apply to the information collection and use practices of these third party advertisers.<br><br> 

You may click on the following link: http://www.networkadvertising.org (or such other URL as may be specified by us from time to time) for information on how to opt-out of the use of cookies.</p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
A “web beacon” is an electronic image placed in the code of a web page or in emails. We use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page to another, to improve overall site performance and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. </p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Third Party Tools</strong><br>
Appcelerator’s Site may also contain third party tracking tools from service providers, examples of which include Google Analytics, DemandBase, and Marketo.  These third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Appcelerator.</p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Appcelerator Network Registration</strong><br>
When you register for the Appcelerator Network, we may collect the following information:  your email address, name, password, city, country, state, Twitter user name, Facebook URL, LinkedIn URL, your title/organization, and phone number. We use such information to manage your Appcelerator account and to provide you with access to our Service.  Your account is required to use Titanium Studio and Titanium Developer, obtain access to free Q&amp;A and paid Helpdesk, use Titanium Analytics, get listed in DevLink, download and use modules, and buy products from Titanium Mobile Marketplace.  We may also use such information to provide you with updates regarding our Service. 
In order to use Appcelerator products, you must have a privacy policy that discloses (a) what data and other information of your End Users and their devices Developer is going to provide to Appcelerator and what data and other information Appcelerator will collect from and about your End Users and their devices and (b) what uses Appcelerator may make of any data or other information about your End Users and their devices.  Without limiting the foregoing, your privacy policy must specifically state that Appcelerator may collect data and other information from and about your End Users and their devices.</p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Titanium Mobile and Desktop SDKs – Titanium Platform</strong><br>
When you use the Appcelerator SDKs (either Mobile or Desktop),  we may track the number of downloads of our SDKs that have occurred.</p>

<p class="norm"><strong>Titanium Studio</strong><br>

</p><p class="norm"><strong>Titanium Analytics</strong><br>
When you use Titanium Platform or Titanium Studio, you have access to Titanium Analytics.  You may opt-out of Titanium Analytics for a mobile and/or desktop application by modifying the application’s tiapp.xml file to change the <analytics> setting to “false”.   Titanium Analytics enables you to track how your End Users use your applications to improve your products and services.  The data you can collect includes the platform, model, manufacturer, operating system version of the device on which the End User uses your application, the timestamps in which the End User launches and exits your application, Titanium SDK Version, and geolocation data i.e., longitude and latitude of the location where the End User uses your application. You may also create custom analytics events for your application that are collected according to the execution logic of the application.  This information is collected and sent back to Appcelerator’s servers.  You can access this data at any time by going to the my.appcelerator.com/apps page and clicking on the “Analytics” button for your application.</analytics></p>
