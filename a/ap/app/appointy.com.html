                    any business using the Services for online scheduling and appointment management
                    purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Consumer” shall refer to an end consumer
                    using the Services to schedule or modify an appointment, provide feedback or submit
                    a review, or utilize any other aspect of the Services. &nbsp;“You” shall
                    refer to both Consumers and Business Users.&nbsp; The following Privacy Policy outlines
                    how Appointy will treat information as you use the Services. BY USING THE SERVICES,
                    YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND IN OUR TERMS OR USE.&nbsp;
                    <br>
                    Appointy reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, update,
                    add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without notice
                    to you. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. &nbsp;For Business
                    Users, this Privacy Policy will be available in the “My Account” section

                        <br>
                        PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual
                        user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that
                        specific individual. &nbsp;Examples of PII include names, telephone numbers, social
                        security numbers, credit card numbers and other unique identifiers.&nbsp; In no
                        event will Appointy (i) use PII to market its services or those of a third party,
                        or (ii) sell or transfer PII to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties
                        with access thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or
                        in our applicable Terms of Use.

                        the Service, the Consumer may elect to provide information including, but not limited

                        “Consumer Information”), that may be Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;
                        We may also collect credit card information from Consumers in circumstances where
                        a Business User has decided that it requires such information to be collected from
                        Consumers scheduling appointments with it through the Services. We may also collect
                        user submitted information including but not limited to ratings &amp; reviews of
                        businesses and service providers with whom the submitting Consumer has interacted

                        to use the Services, we may ask that Business User to provide business information
                        including the business name, type of business, email address, telephone number,
                        and street address (“Business Information”).&nbsp; We may also ask Business
                        Users to provide a valid credit card number and billing address so that we can process
                        any payments for use of the Services by such Business User, pursuant to the Business
                        User Terms of Use.&nbsp; Business Users, as registered users of the Services, may
                        modify their account information at any time by accessing the “My Account”
                        section of their Appointy account when such Business User is logged into the Services.
                        &nbsp;<br>
                        You should be aware that if you upload, post, and/or distribute to the Services

                        those materials and the substantive information contained in them may be accessible
                        by third parties.&nbsp; The activities of third parties are beyond the control of
                        Appointy. &nbsp;Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private
                        on the Appointy website or in other areas of the Services.&nbsp;
                        <br>
                        In the event that Appointy discovers that personal information has been or is compromised
                        as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose
                        personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures

                        We do not intentionally provide PII to third parties except where you provide PII
                        when scheduling an appointment through the Services, when registering to use the
                        Services as a Business User, or to indicate interest in services advertised by one
                        of the businesses bookable through the Services. &nbsp;In any of the above situations,
                        we may provide that information to the appropriate Consumer, Business User or advertiser
                        so that they may attempt to schedule an appointment or provide you with information
                        regarding the advertised products or services about which you inquired.&nbsp;
                        <br>
                        If a Consumer provides any Consumer Information or User Submitted Materials to the
                        Services that are relevant to a Business User with whom that Consumer schedules
                        an appointment or otherwise transacts through the Services, Appointy reserves the

                        User Submitted Materials for purposes of managing the appointment and/or transaction
                        with such Consumer, whether or not such information is Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        <br>
                        Appointy reserves the right, pursuant to the Business User Terms of Use, to provide
                        relevant Business Information to third parties in order to maximize the exposure
                        of Appointy businesses online and the number of appointments scheduled through the
                        Services.<br>
                        We may use PII and any other information provided by a Business User or a Consumer
                        through the Services for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing,
                        and administration.&nbsp; We may share this information with third parties who provide
                        us with administrative services.&nbsp; If we share any of the information collected

                        by their privacy policy.
                        <br>
                        If you or any other user of the Services sends an email or provides an email address
                        to Appointy for any reason, we reserve the right to retain that email address to
