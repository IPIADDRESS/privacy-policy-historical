  <p><span class="yellow"><strong>APPOINTY PRIVACY POLICY </strong> <br>
    Dated January 28, 2008</span></p>
  <p><br>
    <span class="yellow">Appointy, Inc.</span> owns and provides various websites, services, and software  that facilitate online scheduling of appointments (collectively, the  “Services”).&nbsp; Appointy, Inc. respects your privacy and values your  trust.&nbsp; In this Privacy Policy, we may refer to Appointy, Inc. as “Appointy,”  “us,” or “we.” “Business User” shall refer to any business using the Services  for online scheduling and appointment management purposes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;“Consumer” shall refer to an end consumer using the Services to  schedule or modify an appointment, provide feedback or submit a review, or  utilize any other aspect of the Services. &nbsp;“You” shall refer to both  Consumers and Business Users.&nbsp; The following Privacy Policy outlines how Appointy  will treat information as you use the Services. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU  ACCEPT THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY  POLICY AND IN OUR TERMS OR USE.&nbsp; <br>
    Appointy reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify,  update, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, with or  without notice to you. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for  changes. &nbsp;For Business Users, this Privacy Policy will be available in the  “My Account” section of the Appointy website.&nbsp; Your continued use of the  Services after the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy will signify  your acceptance of those changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)&nbsp; </u></span> <br>
    PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific  individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or  locate that specific individual. &nbsp;Examples of PII include names, telephone  numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers and other unique  identifiers.&nbsp; In no event will Appointy (i) use PII to market its services  or those of a third party, or (ii) sell or transfer PII to third parties, or  otherwise provide third parties with access thereto, except as specifically  provided in this Privacy Policy and/or in our applicable Terms of Use. </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Consumers</u></span>.&nbsp;  If a Consumer chooses to use the Service, the Consumer may elect to provide  information including, but not limited to, that Consumer’s name, telephone number,  and email address (collectively “Consumer Information”), that may be Personally  Identifiable Information.&nbsp; We may also collect credit card information  from Consumers in circumstances where a Business User has decided that it  requires such information to be collected from Consumers scheduling  appointments with it through the Services. We may also collect user submitted  information including but not limited to ratings &amp; reviews of businesses  and service providers with whom the submitting Consumer has interacted through  the Services, and any responses or other postings by a Business User.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Business Users</u></span>.  When a Business User registers to use the Services, we may ask that Business  User to provide business information including the business name, type of  business, email address, telephone number, and street address (“Business  Information”).&nbsp; We may also ask Business Users to provide a valid credit  card number and billing address so that we can process any payments for use of  the Services by such Business User, pursuant to the Business User Terms of  Use.&nbsp; Business Users, as registered users of the Services, may modify  their account information at any time by accessing the “My Account” section of  their Appointy account when such Business User is logged into the Services.  &nbsp;<br>
      You should be aware that if you upload, post, and/or distribute to the  Services material, including but not limited to, Personally Identifiable  Information, questions, feedback, reviews, data, comments, ratings,  suggestions, information, text, data, software, sounds, photographs, podcasts,  audio, audiovisual, video, images, graphics, messages and other content or  materials of any nature (“User Submitted Materials”), those materials and the  substantive information contained in them may be accessible by third  parties.&nbsp; The activities of third parties are beyond the control of Appointy.  &nbsp;Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private on the  Appointy website or in other areas of the Services.&nbsp; <br>
    In the event that Appointy discovers that personal information has been or  is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly notify  those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance  with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as  otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Use of Personally Identifiable Information.</u></span>&nbsp; We do not intentionally provide PII  to third parties except where you provide PII when scheduling an appointment  through the Services, when registering to use the Services as a Business User,  or to indicate interest in services advertised by one of the businesses  bookable through the Services. &nbsp;In any of the above situations, we may  provide that information to the appropriate Consumer, Business User or advertiser  so that they may attempt to schedule an appointment or provide you with  information regarding the advertised products or services about which you  inquired.&nbsp; <br>
      If a Consumer provides any Consumer Information or User Submitted Materials  to the Services that are relevant to a Business User with whom that Consumer  schedules an appointment or otherwise transacts through the Services, Appointy  reserves the right to provide such Business User with the relevant Consumer  Information and/or User Submitted Materials for purposes of managing the  appointment and/or transaction with such Consumer, whether or not such  information is Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Appointy reserves the right, pursuant to the Business User Terms of Use, to  provide relevant Business Information to third parties in order to maximize the  exposure of Appointy businesses online and the number of appointments scheduled  through the Services.<br>
      We may use PII and any other information provided by a Business User or a  Consumer through the Services for internal purposes, such as sales, human  resources, marketing, and administration.&nbsp; We may share this information  with third parties who provide us with administrative services.&nbsp; If we  share any of the information collected from you with such a third party, their  use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy. <br>
      If you or any other user of the Services sends an email or provides an  email address to Appointy for any reason, we reserve the right to retain that  email address to use to send future notifications in accordance with this  Privacy Policy and the applicable Appointy Terms of Use.&nbsp; <br>
    Information and User Submitted Materials provided by a Business User on its  profile or elsewhere on the Services will be accessible by Consumers.&nbsp;  Information and User Submitted Materials provided by a Consumer, including any  personally identifiable information provided when such Consumer schedules an  appointment through the Services, will be made available to the Business User  with whom the Consumer is scheduling an appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></span>&nbsp; <br>
    Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot  be tracked to a specific individual.&nbsp; Examples of non-personally  identifiable information include, but are not limited to, the type of internet  browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using,  your IP address, the time and date of your use of the Services, and whether or  not you clicked on hypertext links within the Services.&nbsp; We may collect  non-personally identifiable information while you use the Services.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u></span>&nbsp; <br>
    We may use the non-personally identifiable information to generate user  statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners. If we  provide any such information to others, we will provide such information in the  aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information  about any individual users.&nbsp; We may also use the non-personally identifiable  information to generate statistics that we may provide to you and to other  businesses using the Services, including, for example, the number of  appointments in a certain time period.&nbsp; We also may provide non-personally  identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform services for  us.</p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Cookies </u></span><br>
      Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive to  identify your computer to our servers.&nbsp; If your browser is configured to  accept cookies, we will use cookies to recognize your computer when you visit  the Services so that we can provide you with a more personalized and  streamlined experience and improve the quality of the Services.&nbsp; If you  wish, you can configure your browser to block cookies.&nbsp; In order to accept  and manage appointments, reservations, or bookings made by Consumers through  the Services, however, you must have cookies enabled.<br>
    Advertisements of third-party advertisers may be displayed on the  Services.&nbsp; If you choose to click on a third-party advertisement or link,  we may provide non-personally identifiable information to the owning  advertiser, advertising network and/or web publisher.&nbsp; Also, any such  advertiser, advertising network or web publisher may use cookies or other  technologies to collect information when you are visiting their web  sites.&nbsp; The information advertisers or other third parties collect is  governed by their individual privacy policies.&nbsp; Appointy does not take  responsibility nor can guarantee the content of such third-party privacy  policies.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Notifications</u></span><br>
      We may use such information to send you email messages and other notifications  relating to the Services and your use of the Services.&nbsp; We reserve the  right to notify you through e-mail, facsimiles, text or voice messages, or  notices posted on the Appointy websites, as determined by Appointy in our  discretion.&nbsp; By using the Services, you consent to receiving such  notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Business Users may opt-out of receiving notifications regarding  appointments through the Services by logging into their Appointy account and  changing the notification settings; opting-out of such notifications, however,  will limit the effectiveness of the Services.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the  foregoing, neither Business Users nor Consumers may opt-out of receiving notifications  relating to support of the Services or other notices as required by law.&nbsp;  If we have provided any third party with your personal information, you will  have to contact the third-party directly with any opt-out request. </p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Schedule and Appointment Information</u></span><br>
    Appointy will not share a Business User schedule with anyone, except to the  extent necessary to allow Consumers to browse and schedule appointments.&nbsp;  We will not share a Consumer’s personal schedule information with anyone except  the Business User with whom such Consumer schedules an appointment. &nbsp;Each  Business User will be able to access and view only the schedule for that  business, and only information relating to appointments for that business.</p>
  <p><br>
      <span class="yellow"><u>Other Sharing of Information</u></span><br>
      We may release information when necessary to comply with the law or a court  order or an investigation.&nbsp; We also may release information to law  enforcement to protect our rights, property, or other interests, including  those of our customers or users or to prevent illegal activities or violations  of our Terms of Use (at <a href="Terms-of-use.asp">http://www.Appointy.com/legal</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    In the event that we, in whole or in part, establish a partnership with  another company, or are acquired by or merged with another company, information  we collect may be transferred to the partner or the acquiring or merging  company at time such merger, acquisition, or partnership is closed and to the  extent necessary to fulfill our obligations under such merger, acquisition, or  partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><br>
      <a name="age" id="age"></a><span class="yellow"><u>Child Protection</u></span><br>
    We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13.&nbsp; In  compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any  information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our  database and cancel the corresponding accounts. </p>
  <p><br>
      <a name="public" id="public"></a><a name="refer" id="refer"></a><a name="security" id="security"></a><span class="yellow"><u>Security </u></span><br>
      We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational  measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and  from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, but we cannot  guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those  measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.&nbsp; We  cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over the  Internet, and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of such  information.&nbsp; You acknowledge that you provide your personal information  at your own risk.<br>
