To disable the Google Analytics cookie and any other third party web analytics service provider cookies, some browsers indicate when a cookie is being sent and allow you to decline cookies on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>

Targeted Advertising<br>
We also may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons on our websites and e-mails and on third-party websites and e-mails.  They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests (including for companies not affiliated with us).  You may see these advertisements on our websites and other websites.  This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.<br><br>

How we may use information collected by automated means<br>
We may use the information we collect through automated means on our websites for market research, data analytics and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you've visited us before or are new to the site, and for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including compliance with relevant industry standards.
