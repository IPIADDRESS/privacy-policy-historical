However, when you transact with us (e.g., offer to sell a device) or register to open an account with ApplenBerry, we ask for information about yourself, such as your name, email address, and zip code, which we collect and use as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Once you submit information about yourself to us, you are not anonymous to us. We may also collect additional information about you when you engage in certain activities on the Services, such as: (a) provide transactional information when you sell, donate, offer to recycle, ship, or purchase an item ; (b) when you sign up for special offers; (c) when you visit the Services’ Web pages or the pages of certain ApplenBerry partners ; (d) when you interact with offers and advertisements; (e) when you contact us for help or customer support; (f) when you log into the Services with your account; (g) when you complete a survey; (h) when you post content or provide us with feedback; or (i) when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. ApplenBerry might also receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information. Providing information is purely optional on your part; however, not all features and services (such as, responding to your inquiries) would be available to you if you elect not to provide information. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information by us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We automatically receive and collect Non-personally Identifiable Information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, browser type, browser language, date and time of your query, ApplenBerry cookie information, and the pages you request.

In addition, ApplenBerry will use your email address to contact you under the following circumstances: to respond to your support questions, to notify you of material changes to our policies or website, to request your participation in user surveys, and to deliver products, services and marketing communications that you request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We will use Non-personally Identifiable Information to diagnose problems with our servers and software, to administer the Services, and to gather demographic information.

Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you visit a website; many major Web services use them to provide useful features for their users. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services. ApplenBerry uses cookies for the following general purposes: (a) to track your preferences, such as the address or local zip code you enter; (b) to access your information when you sign in so we can provide you with your personalized content; (c) to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on your interests and activity on our web site; and (d) and to help us analyze and estimate our traffic and use of features on the Services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We may also use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of the Services. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer. We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third party advertisers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We also may allow certain analytic services and providers of applications used on the Services (e.g. sharing buttons) to collect Non-Personally Identifiable information by placing cookies on the Services that will track certain performance of our Services, such as, web traffic, click-throughs, etc., in order to assist us and our service providers in better understanding the interests of our users and to better serve those interests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Advertising</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We may use other companies under agreements with us to serve advertisements when you visit and use the Services. These companies may collect and use [Non-Personally Identifiable Information] (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to the Services and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie, a third party web beacon and/or pixel tags to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice in general and the options that you have, including your option or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org. These cookies, web beacons and pixel tags do not collect any personal information from your computer, such as your e-mail address. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to ApplenBerry's cookies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Targeted Advertising By ApplenBerry</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In order to serve offers and advertisements that may be interest to our users, we may display targeted advertisements on the Services based on Personally Identifiable Information provided by our users, including zip code and profile. We do not provide this Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers when you interact with such an advertisement. However, please note that the advertisers (including ad serving companies) may determine based on their own analysis that a user who interacts with an advertisement targeted by ApplenBerry may fit into a certain demographical category; for example, an advertiser may determine that men ages 25-34 are interacting with a certain advertisement on ApplenBerry from a particular geographic area. You acknowledge that any information collected by such advertisers or advertising networks – and any options that you have with the use of such information – would be handled in accordance with the disclosures provided above in the "Advertising" section.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ApplenBerry does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ApplenBerry under confidentiality agreements. These trusted partners include companies with which ApplenBerry may operate co-branded websites or web-pages to expand their services using ApplenBerry’s Services. These trusted partners may use your personal information to provide services to you on our behalf, evaluate the effectiveness of the services, and to help ApplenBerry communicate with you about offers from ApplenBerry and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of ApplenBerry's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We may transfer information about you if ApplenBerry is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, ApplenBerry will post a notice on its website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by the Services are developed by people over whom ApplenBerry exercises no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. ApplenBerry may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of ApplenBerry's search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Registered users can edit their ApplenBerry account information, including contact preferences, at any time from their "My Account" account management page which you can find at www.ApplenBerry.com/</span><span class="c0">store/customer/account</span><span class="c0">/login.</span><span>&nbsp;We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services and third party products and services that may be of interest to you.
