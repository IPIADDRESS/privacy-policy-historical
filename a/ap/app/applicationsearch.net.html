    <td><p>Privacy Policy for ApplicationSearch.net and all related Websites.</p>
        <p>Last updated    April 7, 2009. </p>
        <p> BY VISITING THIS WEBSITE AND REQUESTING INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THERON,    YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU    DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION    OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES    REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
        <p> THIS POLICY ONLY APPLIES TO THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS WEBSITE. UPON ENTERING THE REQUESTED    INFORMATION, OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RE-DIRECT YOU TO ONE OF OUR BUSINESS    ASSOCIATES WEBSITES FOR COMPLETION AND IMMEDIATE ACTION ON YOUR REQUEST.    ApplicationSearch.net    IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WEBSITE AND YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE PRIVACY    POLICY ON THIS SITE BEFORE ENTERING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
        <p> PLEASE NOTE: THIS PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE    UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY    TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER    THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.</p>
        <p> This policy describes the information collection, use, and dissemination practices    of    ApplicationSearch.net,     ("ApplicationSearch.net")    and applies to    ApplicationSearch.net's     collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by    ApplicationSearch.net    on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies    (collectively, the "Websites"), and (b) on various Third Party websites.     ApplicationSearch.net    is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of Third    Party websites or applications.</p>
        <h4> 1. Collection of Information</h4>
        <p> 1.1 Survey Information. ApplicationSearch.net    collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited    to, when an individual voluntarily completes the survey or registration page either online    or offline. (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites,    and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including    in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar    means.) In the Surveys,    ApplicationSearch.net    may ask an individual to provide various information, which may include his or her    name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell    phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital    status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and    online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time    (together, "Survey Information").    Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to    provide Survey Information to    ApplicationSearch.net    . </p>
        <p> 1.2 Site Membership or Registration. To the extent    registration is required to receive email and possibly postal communications from    ApplicationSearch.net,     this Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail    marketing from    ApplicationSearch.net,     whether at our Website or otherwise. We collect information in certain portions    of our Website, which may include your name, email address, street address, zip    code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date,    gender, education, occupation, employment information, and such other information    as may be requested from time to time or where guests provide content submissions    and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., by way of    responding to questions and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison    searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal    profile information you submit to    ApplicationSearch.net    remains your property, but by submitting that information to    ApplicationSearch.net,     you grant    ApplicationSearch.net,     the right to use that information for marketing purposes.    ApplicationSearch.net,     may also use such information for content improvement and feedback purposes.    ApplicationSearch.net    reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event    ApplicationSearch.net    believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its AUP the    Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if    ApplicationSearch.net    is sold or acquired, or when    ApplicationSearch.net    deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent    to disclosure of any record or communication to any Third Party when    ApplicationSearch.net,     in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. </p>
        <p> "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for    ApplicationSearch.net's     services, via registration at our website.    ApplicationSearch.net    collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers, based on: information    gathered at the time of registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent    electronic mailings and website use. Information collected may include, but is not    necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address, birth date,    telephone number, interests, user behavior and other demographic information.    This information enables us to better tailor our content to subscribers' needs and    to help our clients to promote and sell their products and services. </p>
        <p> 1.3 Requests for Assistance or Service. Other occasions    when    ApplicationSearch.net    obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual requests assistance through    ApplicationSearch.netâ€˜s     customer service department, and (2) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a    ApplicationSearch.net's     service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").</p>
        <p> 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. ApplicationSearch.net    currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related    information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.    Additionally,    ApplicationSearch.net    may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology    Information").</p>
        <p> (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored    on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows    ApplicationSearch.net    to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in    ApplicationSearch.net's     database. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features    and functionality of the Websites. </p>
        <p> (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that    can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt;    programming function -- see <a href="http://truste.org" target="blank">http://truste.org</a> for more information), but can also    be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form    of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired    information about an individual in a database. This allows    ApplicationSearch.net    to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine    products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral    habits for marketing purposes. For example,    ApplicationSearch.net    might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third    Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual listed in    ApplicationSearch.netâ€˜s     database, visits the cosmetic website,    ApplicationSearch.net    receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site,    and    ApplicationSearch.net    would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is interested in    cosmetics.    ApplicationSearch.net    may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane.    In addition to using web beacons on web pages,    ApplicationSearch.net    also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in    ApplicationSearch.net's     database. </p>
        <p> (c) New TechnologyThe use of technology on the Internet,    including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is    ApplicationSearch.net's     use of new and evolving technology. As a result,  ApplicationSearch.net  strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding    its use of technology. </p>
        <p> (d) Usage Tracking and Log Files.  ApplicationSearch.net    tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users    and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing    our emails or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber    usage. </p>
        <p> (e) Optional Registration. ApplicationSearch.net    may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration,    the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information.    This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in    ApplicationSearch.net    services. </p>
        <p> (f) Feedback and Inquiries. You have the ability to    contact  ApplicationSearch.net to provide us with their feedback.    ApplicationSearch.net    uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues. </p>
        <p> (g) IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol)    address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site.    An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.    Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and    to gather broad demographic data. </p>
        <p> (h) Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as    a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users.    A Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1    pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site. We may also occasionally    place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users. GIFs, which do not contain    any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and    respond to e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the    performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular    creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our advertisers and promotional    partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from    their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does    not allow these entities access to user PII. </p>
        <p> 1.5 Outside Information. ApplicationSearch.net    may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources    of information outside of    ApplicationSearch.net    including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). </p>
        <p> 1.6 No Information Collected from Children. ApplicationSearch.net    will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age    of 13. If    ApplicationSearch.net    obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child    under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.    Because it does not collect such information,    ApplicationSearch.net    has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.    ApplicationSearch.net    is designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection    Act ("COPPA"). </p>
        <p> 1.7 Links to External Websites. ApplicationSearch.net's     emails and websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to    external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be passed from    ApplicationSearch.net's     database to the external website, and/or external database, for your convenience    (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website).    ApplicationSearch.net    is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any external website    owner. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website they visit. </p>
        <h4> 2. Use of Individual Information.</h4>
        <p> 2.1 General Use. The following paragraphs in Section    2 describe how    ApplicationSearch.net    currently uses Individual Information, but    ApplicationSearch.net    may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below,    ApplicationSearch.net    may update this policy from time to time.    ApplicationSearch.net    may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means    of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner    advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses. </p>
        <p> 2.2 Email and Unsubscribe Policy. ApplicationSearch.net    uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals.    ApplicationSearch.net    may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish    to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the    instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular    list. </p>
        <p> ApplicationSearch.net    unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated    by    ApplicationSearch.net    on its own behalf. </p>
        <p> 2.3 Content of Email Messages. In certain commercial    email messages sent by    ApplicationSearch.net,     an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button    will cause a reply email to be sent to    ApplicationSearch.net.     The "Subject:" line of    ApplicationSearch.net    email messages will usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser to    ApplicationSearch.net. </p>
        <p> 2.4 Solicited Email. ApplicationSearch.net    only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email    from    ApplicationSearch.net.     As such,    ApplicationSearch.net    does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain    formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to    ApplicationSearch.net's     email messages. </p>
        <p> 2.5 Telemarketing. ApplicationSearch.net    uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals    using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. By    registering and using this Site, You acknowledge that the processing of your individual    information may involve the transfer of such PII from within the European Economic    Area ("EEA") to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not    be as stringent as that within the European Union. We may use individual information    to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized    content and advertising. </p>
        <p> 2.6 Wireless Addresses. If the e-mail address you provide    to    ApplicationSearch.net    is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages at such address from    ApplicationSearch.net    or its business associates (unless and until you have elected not to receive such    messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this policy).    You understand that your wireless carrier's standard rates apply to these messages. </p>
        <p> 2.7 Short Message Service. ApplicationSearch.net    may make available a service through which you can receive messages on your wireless    device via short message service ("SMS Service").

You represent that you are    18 years of age and the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which    messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable    charges. In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your provider's standard    messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence.    All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider.    ApplicationSearch.net    will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery    is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services    are provided on an AS IS basis.    ApplicationSearch.net    may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your    use of the SMS Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with    our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your    wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information    in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also    collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed    by their own policies. </p>
        <p> You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems    which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks.    We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure,    and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.    You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures    best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. We may also    access the content of your account and wireless account with your carrier for the    purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and service-related complaints. </p>
        <p> ApplicationSearch.net    may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including    services that display customized content and advertising.    ApplicationSearch.net    may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate    and improve our technologies and services. When    ApplicationSearch.net    uses business associates to assist    ApplicationSearch.net    in processing your personal information,    ApplicationSearch.net    requires that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality    and security measures.    ApplicationSearch.net    will not share your personal information unless we    have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we    believe in good faith that the disclosure is required to prevent harm or    injury (such as product recalls, fraud, claims or other liability) or to    comply with valid legal processes (subpoenas, warrants) or as required by    law. </p>
        <p> You may remove your information from  ApplicationSearch.net's database. If you remove your information from  ApplicationSearch.net's database it will no longer be used by  ApplicationSearch.net for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or  used by ApplicationSearch.net to send promotional correspondence to you. You  may remove your information by following the instructions at the bottom  of each email message or by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS  text message you have received. </p>
        <p> 2.8 Use of Technology Information. ApplicationSearch.net    uses Technology Information (1) to track a person's online browsing habits    on the Internet, (2) to determine which areas of    ApplicationSearch.net's     websites are most frequently visited. This information helps    ApplicationSearch.net    to better understand the online habits of individuals so that    ApplicationSearch.net    can target advertising and promotions to them. </p>
        <p> 2.10 Profiles of Individuals. ApplicationSearch.net    uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be    created by combining Survey Information with other    sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases. </p>
        <p> 2.11 Storage of Individual Information. ApplicationSearch.net    stores the Individual Information in a database on its' computers. Our computers    have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss,    misuse, and alteration of the information under    ApplicationSearch.net's     control. Not withstanding such measures,    ApplicationSearch.net    cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its computers from being    illegally accessed, and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered. </p>
        <h4> 3. Dissemination of Individual Information. </h4>
        <p> 3.1 Marketing and Order Fulfillment. ApplicationSearch.net    will transfer Individual Information to Third Parties when necessary to provide    a product or service that a person orders from such Third Party while using    ApplicationSearch.net's     websites or when responding to offers provided by    ApplicationSearch.net.    ApplicationSearch.net    may also use a Third Party to provide you with information regarding    ApplicationSearch.net,     its services and products or to provide you with Third party services and information    which you have requested. </p>
        <p> 3.2 Legal Process. ApplicationSearch.net    may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other    legal processes. </p>
        <h4> 4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</h4>
        <p> 4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons. Advertising    agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") who    place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet generally may use their    own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about individuals.    ApplicationSearch.net    does not control Advertisers' use of such technology and    ApplicationSearch.net    has no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about    individuals. </p>
