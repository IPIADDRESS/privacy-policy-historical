					<div class="redTitleMedium">Privacy Policy</div>
					<p><em>Effective Date: April 6, 2007</em></p>
					<p>Applebee's Services, Inc. (Applebee's) is committed to safeguarding your 
						privacy; we take your privacy seriously. We will not sell, rent or otherwise 
						distribute your personally identifiable information, which we receive through 
						our website or from any other source, to third parties except as explained 
						below. Please read the following policy to understand the care with which 
						Applebee's will treat your information. This policy may change from time to 
						time so please check back periodically.</p>
					<p>If you have concerns, comments or questions concerning this policy, please 
						contact:</p>
					<p><a href="mailto:privacydesk@applebees.com">privacydesk@applebees.com</a></p>
					<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to (a) employment 
						applications submitted through the Web site, which may be shared with 
						independently-owned franchises which are seeking employees in their market area 
						and (b) information from international franchising prospects which is covered 
						by a separate privacy policy, accessible from the International Franchising 
						portion of the Web site.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">What information does Applebee's collect from me?</div>
					<p>Applebee's may collect information about you, such as your name, postal address, 
						email address, zip code, phone number and dining preferences through any of the 
						following: online email address submissions, in-restaurant surveys, research 
						surveys, dining frequency cards, online gift card purchases, guest relations 
						communications and online restaurant location searches or other voluntary 
						activities.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">Can I remain anonymous when I provide information to Applebee's?</div>
					<p>You can visit our Web site without identifying yourself or giving us any 
						personal information. If you give us your email address, purchase gift cards 
						online, voluntarily provide feedback to Guest Relations or complete a survey, 
						you will no longer be anonymous to Applebee's. We may ask you for additional 
						information from time to time, which you may decide to provide to us or not. If 
						you contact Applebee's through the Web site or otherwise, we may keep a record 
						of that correspondence.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">How does Applebee's use the information?</div>
					<p>Applebee's primary goal in collecting information is to improve customer service 
						by understanding your preferences, communicating Applebee's promotions and 
						services and providing you with the best possible experience. For example, if 
						you visit our Web site and give us your zip code, we are able to provide the 
						location of the Applebee's restaurant closest to you. We may also use your 
						information to notify you of special offers and services available from 
						Applebee's, its affiliated companies and franchisees.</p>
					<p>On a blinded, aggregated basis, we may do research on our guests' and Web site 
						users' demographics and behavior based on the information you, other guests and 
						users provide to us. Personally identifiable information would not be used for 
						this type of research. We may disclose such blinded and aggregated data and 
						user statistics to third parties and for other lawful purposes.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">Does Applebee's share my information?</div>
					<p>We will not sell, rent or otherwise distribute your personally identifiable 
						information to third parties, except when we have your permission or under the 
						following circumstances:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>As required by law:</strong>
						We may disclose or access your information when we believe in good faith that 
						the law requires it.
						</li><li>
							<strong>Gift cards:</strong>
						We use a third party service provider to facilitate the gift card service. That 
						third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of your gift card 
						information and may only use your information for the purposes of fulfilling 
						and tracking your order, customer service and reporting to us.
						</li><li>
							<strong>To provide service: </strong>
						We may share aggregated, non-identifiable information as well as personally 
						identifiable information with our franchisees, affiliated companies and service 
						providers, such as those who provide gift card service or email marketing. All 
						such service providers are under contract with Applebee's to help provide 
						specific services. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can 
						choose not to provide the information.
						</li><li>
							<strong>Other:</strong> We may disclose user information in special cases when 
							we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to 
							identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating <a href="./TermsOfUse.aspx">
								Applebee's Web Site Terms of Use</a>, or may otherwise be causing injury to 
							or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Applebee's 
							rights or property, other Applebee's Web site users or customers, or anyone 
							else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also need to disclose user 
							information to service providers when necessary to maintain, service or improve 
							our Web site, products and services. As we continue to develop our business, we 
							may buy or sell business assets. In such transactions, confidential customer 
							information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event 
							of a sale of some or all of Applebee's business, customer and site visitor 
							information may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">How can I control access to my personal information and its use?</div>
					<p>You may contact us at the email address above if you wish to view, edit or 
						delete your personal information from our database and we will use commercially 
						reasonable efforts to accommodate your request.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">How does Applebee's protect financial-related information?</div>
					<p>Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us. 
						You may provide such information to us when you purchase gift cards online. We 
						do not store credit card numbers or bank account numbers. This information will 
						be kept secure and we will transfer your credit card number, bank account 
						number or other personal information only to the third party gift card service 
						provider, which is bound to keep your information confidential, and to the 
						appropriate credit card company or bank only in order to process any online 
						payments.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse or 
						alteration of my information?</div>
					<p>We closely guard your personally identifiable information. We use encryption 
						technology for credit card numbers and bank account numbers. Remember to close 
						your browser window when you have finished your gift card order. This is to 
						ensure that others cannot access your information by using your computer when 
						you are away from it. Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you 
						give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers 
						outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Though no 
						data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 
						Applebee's employs security techniques that are designed to protect the privacy 
						of any information you share with us.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">What are cookies and how does Applebee's use them?</div>
					<p>As part of offering personalized service, we sometimes use cookies and beacon 
						tags or web bugs to store and understand more information about you, such as 
						your nearest Applebee's restaurant. A cookie is a small amount of data that is 
						sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard 
						drive. Beacon tags and web bugs allow us to understand what users have viewed a 
						page. We may use cookies, tags or bugs to allow faster and easier access to 
						your information and to monitor traffic on the site and measure traffic 
						patterns to improve functionality.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">How do I opt out?</div>
					<p>If you no longer wish to receive ongoing marketing communications from us, we 
						will provide you with simple instructions on each marketing email from 
						Applebee's to enable you to unsubscribe from future emails from Applebee's. You 
						may also contact the Privacy Desk as explained above or <a href="#optout">opt out 
							here</a>.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">What else should I know about my privacy?</div>
					<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, 
						that information may be accessible to other online users. Ultimately, you are 
						solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any 
						other personal information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are 
						online.</p>
					<div class="redTitleSmall">How is information from children treated?</div>
					<p class="last">Applebee's does not intend to collect any personally identifiable 
						information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental 
						consent. In fact, when we request personal information from users of this Web 
						site, we also ask for their birthdate in order to comply with the Children's 
						Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which prohibits the collecting of 
						personal information of anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that such a 
						child has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will 
						immediately delete it. If you learn that such a child has provided us with 
						personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian should contact us 
						at the Privacy Desk above and we will immediately delete it.</p>
