  <p class="siteColor"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
  <p> Some pages on this web site employ browser session "cookies." A  cookie is a small piece of data that a web site transfers to your computer's  hard disk to allow the server to distinguish your session from that of others  while you are connected. Requests to send cookies are not designed to collect  information about you, but only about your "browser session." The  cookies make it easier for you to use the dynamic features of our web site. The  cookies and the information about your session are automatically destroyed  shortly after you close your browser. The information is not permanently stored  on your computer. We do not collect personal information about you except as  described above.</p>
