Our legal grounds for such processing is the fulfilling of the agreement. Collection of such information and processing is necessary for us to fulfill our rights and obligations per the agreement with you (See our Terms of Use).</p>

<p>Appspotr collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information in order to provide you with a service that allows you to maintain an online presence. Various features in our website management system will, at your discretion, display your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on your locale. The Appspotr™ Dashboard interface will always give you an option before any piece of your personally identifiable information is presented on your website, and situations where information will be published is made clear in various spots in the interface (for example, your name is tied to welcome emails you send out from our system, and notice of this is given to you within the interface for that tool). Appspotr also uses information collected through the Service to send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will occur through your Appspotr™ Dashboard interface. We also may use your information to send you messages regarding new services or other products from Appspotr, but will not share this information with third parties for any marketing purposes. Information collected through our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website traffic.

This data may also be used to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers for the purposes of customizing ads or content. Depending on the permissions granted to the application, this information may include personally identifiable information (PII) including your e-mail address. This information may also include precise location (i.e. GPS-level data) or WiFi information, apps you have installed and enabled, and your mobile identifier (e.g., Android Advertising ID).</p>

<h1 id="consumer-control-opt-out-options">Consumer Control &amp; Opt-Out Options</h1>

<p>You may in most cases opt out of receiving push notifications by going to your device “Settings” and clicking on “Notifications,” and then changing those settings for some or all of the apps on your device. (Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how these settings work.)</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out of “Cross-App” Advertising on Mobile Devices</strong></p>

<p>You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of interest-based (also called “cross-app”) mobile behavioral advertising, by accessing the “settings” on your Apple or Android mobile device, as follows: By opening the Google Settings app on your device, selecting Ads, and then selecting the option to opt-out of interest-based ads. (Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how these settings work.)</p>

<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to give support, to track specific cases when needed, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this Website.</p>

<h1 id="third-country-transfers">Third Country Transfers</h1>

<p>We try to keep your personal data within the EU/EEA and most of our own IT-systems are localized accordingly. Providers outside of the EU/EEA are Amazon Web Services who are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield . During support and maintenance, we might also temporarily need to transfer information outside of the EU/EEA.</p>

<p>All personal data will always be kept to a minimum and relevant to the cause. Regardless where the personal data is transferred, we always take adequate technical and organizational measures to secure that the level of security is the same as within the EU/EEA and therefore maintains an adequate security level, i.e. by using the EU-commission’s standard contractual clauses or companies that are affiliative to the Privacy Shield.</p>

<h1 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h1>

<p>You have the right to request information regarding the personal data that we process of you and have inaccurate information corrected. Keep in mind that we can ask for additional information about you to ensure safe and effective processing of your request and to ensure that information is given to the right person.</p>

<p>You have the right to demand that we remove the personal data we have of you, i.e. if information no longer is needed to achieve the purpose they were collected for or if you no longer wish to receive direct marketing etc. Observe that when deemed necessary we can reject your request, i.e. if the personal data is required for tax- or auditing purposes. If you want to contact us, please see our contact information under “Contact information” below.</p>

<p>You also have the right to request the limitation of processing. In such cases we might not be able to you the Service and therefore might have to assess the situation before making such a decision. However, such a request will most likely result in the inability to use the Service and deletion of your account.</p>

<p>In cases where you have given your consent or if the processing is based on a contractual relationship with you, you have the right to, under certain circumstances, have your data transferred to another personal data controller. This on the other hand requires that the transfer is technologically possible and can be done by automated means.</p>

<p>If you want to know how we process your personal data you can send a written and signed request to us (see “Contact information” below).</p>

<h1 id="business-transitions">Business Transitions</h1>

<p>In the event Appspotr goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

<h1 id="legal-disclaimer">Legal Disclaimer</h1>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website.</p>

<h1 id="changes-in-this-privacy-statement">Changes in this Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without informing affected customers.</p>
