<div class="title">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</div>

<p>Apple Bottoms collects personally identifiable information when you request information from Apple Bottoms.  On such occasions, Apple Bottoms asks for your name, email address, zip code and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information.  Apple Bottoms also receives and records information from server logs from your browser including cookie information relating to pages requested and the like.</p>

<p>Apple Bottoms does not seek to collect such information from persons under the age of 18.  If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any such information to us.  If you are the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 who has provided such information to us, please inform us (through the Web site or telephone number listed above) and we will remove such information from our database as described further below.</p>

<p>In addition, no person (of any age) is required to provide us with the personally identifiable information we request.  If you do not wish to provide such information, you are free not to do so.  Your provision of requested information to us through our Web site or other means is presumed by us to be voluntary and with your consent to the uses described herein.  If after submitting personally identifiable information to us, you wish to "opt-out," please contact us as noted above and we will remove your information from our database as set forth below in the section titled "Managing Your Information."

<p>Apple Bottoms uses the information you provide to us to customize advertising and content that we present to you, to contact you concerning specials and new products and to enhance our product offerings.  Apple Bottoms will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party except when:</p>

<ul><li>You have been given an opportunity to "opt out" of sharing the information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided;</li>
<li>Apple Bottoms must share the information in order to provide a product or service that you have requested, in which case we will demand that any third party we use to fulfill your order agree that it does not have the right to use the personally identifiable information other than to fulfill your request; or</li>
<li>Apple Bottoms is required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure.</li></ul>

<div class="title">MANAGING YOUR INFORMATION</div>

<p>You are entitled to request access to and correction of all your personal data collected by us via this Web site, as well as to require us to delete your data if you no longer want us to process it.  You can make such a request or a related inquiry by <a href="/contactus.php/">emailing us</a> or by calling 1-800-637-9594.
