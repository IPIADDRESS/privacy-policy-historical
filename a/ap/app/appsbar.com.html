        <h3>SECURITY</h3>
    <p>appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp; uses secure connections during the transmission of log in, registration and membership information. This means that information collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information, is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your computer and appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp; computers. The technology used is called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Through the use of this technology, your information collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code and decoded on either appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;'s secure server or the systems of the third party contracted to provide the service in question. You can verify that the connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or web site address); for example, the address will change from http://www.appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;.com to https://www.appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;.com when a secure connection is in place.
However, while we employ data encryption technology, you should be aware that there is an inherent risk in transmitting any data electronically. This risk is inherent in all Internet dealings.
