                                <strong>SECURITY: </strong>Appsbar uses secure connections during the transmission of  log in, registration and membership information. This means that information  collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership  information, is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your  computer and Appsbar computers. The technology used is called Secure Socket  Layer (SSL). Through the use of this technology, your information collected  through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership  information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled  code and decoded on either Appsbar's secure server or the systems of the third  party contracted to provide the service in question. You can verify that the  connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of  your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or web site  address); for example, the address will change from <a href="http://www.appsbar.com/"><strong>http://www.appsbar.com</strong></a> to <a href="https://www.appsbar.com/"><strong>https://www.appsbar.com</strong></a> when a secure  connection is in place.<br>
                                However, while we employ data encryption technology,<strong> </strong>you should be aware that there is an  inherent risk in transmitting any data electronically. This risk is inherent in  all Internet dealings. Consequently, we cannot guarantee that any Personally  Identifiable Information transmitted will be prevented from being viewed or  used by any particular person and therefore, you agree to hold us harmless from and against any injury, financial or  otherwise, that results from such unauthorized viewing or use.&nbsp; Moreover, e-mails sent to us over the Internet are susceptible to detection,  decryption, eavesdropping or tampering. Thus, you agree to hold us harmless  from and against any harm, financial or otherwise, that results from such  detection, decryption, eavesdropping or tampering of e-mails.&nbsp; </p>
                              <p>In addition, you must take steps to maintain the security of your private information by  keeping your password and other personal information confidential.&nbsp; It is important for you to protect against  unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off  when finished using a shared computer. </p>
