    <h1 style="color:#0a379b !important;">SECURITY</h1>
    <p style="color:#0a379b !important;">appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp; uses secure connections during the transmission of log in, registration and membership information. This means that information collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information, is encrypted before it is sent over the Internet between your computer and appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp; computers. The technology used is called Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Through the use of this technology, your information collected through those pages dealing with sign in, registration and membership information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code and decoded on either appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;'s secure server or the systems of the third party contracted to provide the service in question. You can verify that the connection is secure because you will see a key or a padlock at the bottom of your browser. Another identifier of a secure connection is the URL (or web site address); for example, the address will change from http://www.appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;.com to https://www.appsbar<span class="Rmark">®</span>&nbsp;.com when a secure connection is in place.
However, while we employ data encryption technology, you should be aware that there is an inherent risk in transmitting any data electronically. This risk is inherent in all Internet dealings. Consequently, we cannot guarantee that any Personally Identifiable Information transmitted will be prevented from being viewed or used by any particular person and therefore, you agree to hold us harmless from and against any injury, financial or otherwise, that results from such unauthorized viewing or use.  Moreover, e-mails sent to us over the Internet are susceptible to detection, decryption, eavesdropping or tampering. Thus, you agree to hold us harmless from and against any harm, financial or otherwise, that results from such detection, decryption, eavesdropping or tampering of e-mails.  </p>
    
    <p style="color:#0a379b !important;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="color:#0a379b !important;">In addition, you must take steps to maintain the security of your private information by keeping your password and other personal information confidential.  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </p>
