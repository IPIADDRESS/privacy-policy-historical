					us to actually learn the identity of the Visitor from whom it was
					collected and serves us mostly to better understand and improve on

					regarding the Visitor’s device, operating system, internet
					browser, screen resolution, language and keyboard settings, internet
					service provider, referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, and the
					origin of the Visitor's visit to our Services. <br>In addition, if a
					Visitor contacts us in any way (such as via e-mail or any contact

					account credentials (username and hashed password), full name,
