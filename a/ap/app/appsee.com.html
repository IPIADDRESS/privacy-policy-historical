            <p class="pp-header">2. Which information we may collect on our Subscribers?</p><p>
                We may collect two types of data and information from our Subscribers:<br>(i) Non-personal
                Information, which is un-identified and non-identifiable information, without particular reference
                to the identity of the Subscriber from which such information was collected; and<br>(ii) Personal
                Information, which is individually identifiable information that identifies an individual, or
                may with reasonable effort identify an individual, either alone or in combination with other
                information, or may be of private or sensitive nature.<br>For the avoidance of doubt, any
                Non-personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as
                Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.<br>Personal and Non-personal
                Information which is being gathered in connection with the site and/or service may consist of
                the following:<br>- Subscribers who
                are interested in opening an Account in order to use our Services&nbsp;should provide details
                via the registration form of the Site (namely, name, address, e-mail address, company, the
                name of its Application, phone number). In addition, we may collect Personal Information in
                order to charge the Subscriber for our Services. This information may include billing information (see Section 11 below regarding the payment method).
                <br><b>
    We do not collect any Personal Information from&nbsp;you&nbsp;or related to you without
    your approval, which is obtained,&nbsp;inter alia, through your active acceptance to the Terms
    and the Privacy Policy.
</b><br>
            </p><p class="pp-header"> 3. How Do We Collect Information on Our Subscribers?</p><p>
                There
                are two main methods we use to collect information:<br>a. We collect Non-personal Information through your use of the Site and/or Service. In other words,
                when&nbsp;you&nbsp;are using the Site and/or Service we are aware of it and may gather, collect
                and record certain information relating to such usage.&nbsp;<br>b. We
                collect Personal Information&nbsp;which&nbsp;you&nbsp;provide us voluntarily&nbsp;when you register to
                our Site and open an Account by completing the registration form. We store the Personal Information
                either independently or through the help of our authorized third-party service providers as detailed
                below.
            </p><p class="pp-header">4. What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?</p><p>
                We collect
                Non-personal and Personal Information in order to provide, operate and improve the Site and Services,
                including for statistical and research purposes; to enable us to further develop, customize and improve
                the Site and/or Service based on Subscribers’ common preferences, uses, attributes and anonymized
                data; to create and provide our research and business partners and affiliates with anonymized data and
                other aggregated, statistical and/or inferred Non-personal Information; to enable us to provide our
                Subscribers with a better user experience, with more relevant and accurate information, services, features
                and functionalities, and with technical assistance and support; and in order to abide by any applicable law.
            </p><p class="pp-header">
                5. Where Do We Store Your Information?
            </p><p>
                Our Subscribers' Personal Information, and/or their
                End-Users' Personal Information (if any is collected and maintained by us, on our Subscribers' behalf)
                may be maintained, processed and stored by the Appsee Group in the United States of America, in the EU,

                Group's behalf are each committed to keep it protected and secured, in accordance with industry standards
                and regardless of any lesser legal requirements which may apply in their jurisdiction(s).

                6. Sharing Information with Third Parties
            </p><p>
    The Appsee Group will not share any Personal Information it
    collects with any third party, except in the following cases: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation,

    protection laws as your jurisdiction; (j) to enable&nbsp;payment through certain online payment method

                7. Privacy of End-User Data
            </p><p>
    As part of the operation of our Service you may provide us with data about your End-User’s use
    of your mobile application (the “End-User Data”), such as:<br>(a)
    Non-personal Information regarding the End-Users:
    which consists of technical information and aggregated usage information, and may contain, among other
    things:&nbsp;(i) the End- User’s type and version of operation system; &nbsp;(ii) the End User’s
    usage length; (iii) the End-User’s phone model; (iv) the End-User’s country; (v) screens the End-User
    visited in the your mobile application; (vi) the End-Users touch gestures performed in your mobile application;
    (vii) the End-User’s scrolling activity; (viii) the End-User’s test; and (viv) any other actions
    the End-User performed during his/her use of your mobile application.<br>(b)
    Personal Information regarding the End-User:&nbsp;as detailed in our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>, you are prohibited from providing us any Personal Information with respect to Your End-Users.<br><br>
            Our Services and the&nbsp;Appsee&nbsp;SDK
    will not collect&nbsp;the End-User's IP address, nor any information about other programs that the End-Users are
    running on their mobile phone/computer. The&nbsp;Appsee SDK&nbsp;does not track the End-User's activity across
    applications that do not use&nbsp;the&nbsp;Services,&nbsp;and will not collect any passwords entered into the
    End-User's mobile phone/computer. We will use the End-User Data only for the following
    purposes: (1) to store and process End-User Data for the preparation and delivery of our Services,&nbsp;including
    compiled analytics Reports; (2) &nbsp;for use on an anonymous basis, in the aggregate, to perform
    “application uses”&nbsp;analysis and statistical reports,&nbsp;inter alia, to operate and
    improve our Services; and (3) for the purposes which are specified in Section 4,&nbsp;mutatis&nbsp;mutandis.
    We reserve the right to retain the End-User Data we process on&nbsp;your&nbsp;behalf for as long as we are
    providing you with the Services and for a reasonable time thereafter, according to the data retention plan
    that the Subscriber has purchased or a longer period as legally required. As further detailed herein
    and in the Terms, we have no direct relationship with the individual End-Users. Therefore, an End-User
    who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate End-User Data or withdraw consent for further use of its
    End-User Data should direct its query to the applicable Subscriber he/she deals with directly. If the
    Subscriber requests us to remove such data we will do that, per section 8 below.
</p><p class="pp-header">
                8. Access, Modification, Deletion and Retention of

            </p><p>
                When you access or use the Site and/or Service, we may use industry-wide technologies such as
                “cookies” and Flash (or similar technologies), which stores certain information on your computer
                (“Local Storage”) and will enable automatic activation of certain features, and make your experience
                more convenient and effortless. It is easy to prohibit the Local Storage. Most browsers will allow&nbsp;you&nbsp;to
                erase cookies from your computer's hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is
                stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option in Flash you should use the settings option of Flash
                according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider. Note that if&nbsp;you&nbsp;block or erase
                cookies, or change the settings of Flash, your online experience may be limited.<br>We may also use certain third-party cookies.
                These are a different kind of cookies, stored on&nbsp;your&nbsp;computer by third parties, rather than by the
                Appsee Group. This kind of cookie is only read (and not altered by the Site) each time&nbsp;you&nbsp;visit the Site,
                and also when you visit certain websites or applications that use similar cookies. Third-party cookies usually store
                only Non-personal Information, such as the web pages&nbsp;you&nbsp;have visited, the duration of your browsing, etc.
