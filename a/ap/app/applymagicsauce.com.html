        determined by what you choose to share, but may include:</p>

  <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

    <p>Cookies provide information regarding the computer used by a visitor. We use cookies on this
        site to gather information about your computer in order to enhance your experience and
        enable certain features.</p>

    <p>We use self-expiring session cookies for the purpose of maintaining the test session for a
        given user. We also use them to anonymously match the session with sessions on our other
        websites, which are: <a href="https://youronline.life">youronline.life</a>, <a href="https://discovermyprofile.com">discovermyprofile.com</a>, <a href="http://concertoplatform.com ">concertoplatform.com</a> and occasionally other
        domains that explicitly state if cookies are used in their respective user consent policies.
        Session matching merely tells us whether it was likely to be the same person using multiple
        websites we manage, without telling us who this person is.</p>

    <p>We also use cookies for Google Analytics, Facebook Social Plugins and Twitter Social
        Plugins.</p>

    <p>Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors
        engage with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about
        how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it. Like many services,
        Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case,
        where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the
        information to compile reports and to help us improve our site. Google Analytics collects
        information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.
        You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site. For more
        information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use,
        visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Facebook Social Plugins are optional part of the site and one needs to have a Facebook
        Account to use them. Their usage is a subject to Facebook’s Data Policy.</p>

    <p>Twitter Social Plugins are optional part of the site and one needs to have a Twitter Account
        to use them. Their usage is a subject to Twitter’s Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>You can adjust the settings on your computer to decline any cookies if you wish. However, if
        you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our site. For more
        information please read the advice at <a href="http://aboutcookies.org">AboutCookies.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>

  <p>The information you submit to the website may be used for scientific research purposes, as defined in Recital
    159 of the GDPR, which includes for example technological development and demonstration, fundamental research and
    applied research. The information will be stored for as long as it is relevant for these scientific research
    purposes, which are conducted in the public interest.</p>

  <p>If you have previously visited or submitted data to another website maintained by the University of Cambridge
    Psychometrics Centre, we may match the data you submit to this website with that other data for the purposes of
    scientific research and to provide you with more accurate and informative feedback. This matching is done on an
    anonymous basis using a self-expiring session cookie. We cannot and will not ever attempt to personally identify
    or contact any individual user of this website.</p>

  <p>In operating our website it may become necessary to transfer data that we collect from you to locations outside
    of the European Union for processing and storing. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data
    remains secure in such an event.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we may use the information we collect in order to comply with applicable laws and to provide you with
    information that you request from us.</p>

  <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>

  <p>We may share the information collected by this website with other academic researchers (with a formal
    University affiliation and email) or with registered charities and non-profits, but only in an anonymous format
    such that the information can never be used to identify you or any other individual user. We will never share
    your data with any commercial organisations. We may additional be required to disclose information for the purpose
    of complying with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Links</h2>

    <p>On occasion we may include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it
        does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards privacy. You should
        review the third party’s privacy policy before sending them any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Access to Information</h2>

  <p>You have the right to view and delete any information that you have submitted to us through this website at any
