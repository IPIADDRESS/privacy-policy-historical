                IMPORTANT NOTICE TO USERS WHO DOWNLOADED OR USED CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED
                BELOW) AND ITS RELATED SERVICES AND FEATURES BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2014.</p>
            <p>
                Due to the restructuring of Conduit Ltd. (“Conduit”), as of January 1, 2014, the
                Software will be operated and provided by ClientConnect Ltd. instead of Conduit.
                For all intents and purposes, ClientConnect Ltd. will be taking Conduit’s place
                as the party to the Agreements.</p>
            <p>
                As of January 1, 2014, the Agreements, in their entirety, including all of Conduit’s
                rights, performance, duties, liabilities and obligations contained therein, will
                be assigned and delegated to ClientConnect Ltd. You agree and acknowledge that with
                this assignment and delegation, Conduit is released from all its duties, liabilities,
                and obligations under the Agreements.</p>
            <p>
                In order to enable your continuous and uninterrupted use of the ClientConnect Software,
                Conduit has temporarily licensed its registered trademarks and trade names to ClientConnect
                Ltd. Hence, you may still see Conduit’s trademarks and trade names appearing in
                the ClientConnect Software, such as in offer screens or on other ClientConnect Software-related
                pages.</p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy governs your use of the AppStream Website located at <a href="/">
                    http://appstrm.com</a> and any software and/or services and/or features provided
                by ClientConnect Ltd. (collectively, the "ClientConnect Software"). This Privacy
                Policy explains how ClientConnect Ltd. and its affiliates (together, “ClientConnect”,
                “we,” or “us”) treat your information and protect your privacy when you use the
                ClientConnect Software, and the rights and options available to you regarding your
                information. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the
                information we may collect and use when you access, download and/or use the ClientConnect
                Software. All capitalized terms that are defined in the EULA, will have the same
                meaning when used in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
                PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, AND/OR USING THE CLIENTCONNECT
                SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY,
                INCLUDING THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND USAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU DISAGREE
                TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT DOWNLOAD, CONNECT TO, ACCESS, ACTIVATE,
                AND/OR USE THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE, AND ARE OBLIGED TO UNINSTALL, ERASE, OR REMOVE
                THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE FROM YOUR COMPUTER.

                The ClientConnect Software may include various features and content that are offered
                and delivered to you by the Publisher or other third parties, such as news, messages,
                and games, as well as features and content that you may choose to add (“Content”).
                The following are the privacy practices of ClientConnect. Third parties must comply
                with these policies when providing you with Content that is included, directly or

            <p>
                There are several types of data being collected from you as detailed herein. EXCEPT
                AS EXPRESSLY DETAILED HEREIN, IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO PROVIDE CLIENTCONNECT
                WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO USE THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE.
                “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies an individual,
                including their login credentials to a third-party website, name, postal address,
                and email address.

                As part of the functionality provided by the ClientConnect Software (through the
                Toolbar and/or the Search Protect software products), we may collect and store information
                about your search activity when you use our web search services (such as search
                queries). This information may be shared with third-party applications that use
                Search Data to function, or to offer you more customized information and services.
                The information is collected and stored by Cookies (as explained below) and may
                include Personally Identifiable Information, depending on your search query. For
                instance, if you search your own name, Personally Identifiable Information would
                be included in the search query. BY USING THE SEARCH FEATURES PROVIDED BY US, YOU
                ARE CONSENTING TO GRANT CLIENTCONNECT PERMISSION TO COLLECT YOUR SEARCH QUERIES,
                SHARE THEM WITH THIRD PARTIES, AND USE SEARCH-RELATED COOKIES.</p>

            <p>
                The ClientConnect Software further collects anonymous, aggregated information and
                non-personal data, such as ClientConnect Software-generated User IDs, User language,
                Internet Protocol (IP) address, the geographic location of the device from which
                you access the web, and other ClientConnect Software Usage Data, all of which do
                not include Personally Identifiable Information. We may use such information, including
                making it available to our service providers, partners, and other third parties.
                You may choose not to send ClientConnect Software Usage Data at any time when you
                disable or uninstall the ClientConnect Software.

                Browsing Data.</p>
            <p>
                The ClientConnect Software (including the Toolbar, the Search Protect, and the Value
                Apps software) may also collect and store information about your web browsing locally
                on your device, like the web pages that you have visited and the content you have
                accessed. This locally saved information may interact with the ClientConnect Software
                and send us information about your web browsing so we can suggest services or provide
                you with ads that may be more relevant to you, including via our <a href="http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings">
                    Partners</a> when using the Value Apps software. Only generalized inferences
                are passed from the ClientConnect Software to our servers.</p>
            <p>
                Please note that when using Value Apps, your Browsing Data may also include information
                from secured web pages that you have visited. For example, it may include product
                codes, purchase prices, and coupons used during online purchases. This information
                may be collected by us and/or by our <a href="http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings">
                    Partners</a> within Value Apps. Note that we will neither store nor use any
                of your sensitive information that may appear on secured pages.

            <p>
                We may combine the web Search Data with other non-Personally Identifiable Information
                (as further detailed above, e.g. Browsing Data or Usage Data) and if we do, some
                of the otherwise non-Personally Identifiable Information may become Personally Identifiable
                Information (for example, see the following section about the Search Protect software).
                In addition, the ClientConnect Software also takes the form of apps, buttons, or
                gadgets that we created for your enjoyment. If this ClientConnect Software requires
                any access, collection, use, or sharing of your information – both your Personally
                Identifiable Information and non-Personally Identifiable Information, then we will
                ask for your permission prior to accessing your information.

                Search Protect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Search Protect is a separate piece of software installed on your hard drive in connection
                with your installation of a Toolbar or third-party software. It is designed to change
                and protect your preferred Browser home page and default search settings from unintentional
                takeover by third-party software during redirection of service attacks. Search Protect
                may alert you if a third party attempts to change your Browser’s default search
                or home page settings. Further explanation about the Search Protect software is
                available in the ClientConnect <a href="http://www.ourtoolbar.com/Eula/">EULA</a>.
                Search Protect captures some non-Personally Identifiable Information about your
                Internet Browser, including your Browser search settings, your computer, and companies’
                attempts to redirect your search settings, and stores this information with your
                Search Data (search queries and/or IP address). ClientConnect does not sell or rent
                the information you provide through Search Protect to any Third Parties. It may
                share the information with its wholly owned subsidiaries or <a href="http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings">

                Value Apps is an aggregation, categorization, and optimization platform offering
                Apps based on your browsing information. Value Apps is installed on your Browser
                or computer in connection with your installation of a Toolbar or third-party Extension.
