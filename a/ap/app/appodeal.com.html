<h4>(d) Do Not Track</h4>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.

<h4>(e) Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</h4>
<p>We hope that you find the display of interest-based Ads valuable. However, if you wish to opt-out of these advertising services, you can edit your preferences by visiting the “Settings” page of the Website and selecting the option to opt-out.</p>
<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your Devices or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.

However, on many mobile Devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their Device settings or by downloading the AppChoices mobile application offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="//networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="//www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>&nbsp;and <a href="//www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics by following this link: <a href="//tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a></p>
<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out found at <a href="/home/sdk-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.appodeal.com/home/sdk-opt-out</a>&nbsp;and/or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each Device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile Device. You must separately opt-out on each Device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<h3>7. SECURITY OF Your INFORMATION</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security standards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse, such as using SSL encryption.
