Protecting your privacy is important to Apple. We strive to
keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring
that you are aware of and understand the Apple Customer
Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service.
Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn
how we handle your personal information.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">Why we collect personal information</font></b>
				<br>
Apple collects and uses your personal information to give
you superior customer service, to provide you with
convenient access to our products and services, and to make
a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your
personal information to keep you up to date on the latest
product announcements, software updates, special offers and
other information we think you’d like to hear about.
This may occasionally include information from other
technology companies about products and services that can
add value to your Apple products. From time to time, we may
also use your personal information to contact you to
participate in a market research survey, so that we can
gauge customer satisfaction and develop better products.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">How we collect personal information</font></b>
				<br>
We collect information about you in several ways. For
example, we might ask for your contact information when you
correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request
service, register to attend a seminar or participate in an
online survey. In addition, when you register a new Apple
product, sign up for Apple Internet services or ask to be
included in an email mailing list, we collect and store the
information you provide in a secure database.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
To save you time and make our web services even easier to
use, some areas of the Apple website allow you to create an
"Apple ID" using your personal information. Here's how it
works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name, phone
number and email address—then choose a password and
password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for
security. The system saves your information and assigns you
a personal Apple ID. Next time you order something from the
Apple Store or register a new product, you can simply enter
your email address and password—the system will
automatically look up the information it needs.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">When we disclose personal information</font></b>
				<br>
Because Apple is a global company, your personal information
may be shared with other Apple business units around the
world. They will protect your personal information in
accordance with the Apple Customer Privacy Policy. Apple may
occasionally share your personal contact information with
carefully selected technology companies, to keep you
informed about related products and services. For example,
when new software is released, we may work with the
developer to ensure that you're aware of the latest software
available for your Mac. If you do not want to receive
promotional information from Apple or these technology
companies, click <a href="http://www.apple.com/contact/myinfo" target="_blank">www.apple.com/contact/myinfo</a> to
update your personal contact preferences.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
Apple works with other companies that help us provide Apple
products and services to you and we may provide your
personal information to these companies. For example, we
give shipping companies this information so they can deliver
your products efficiently. The information they receive is
for shipping and delivery purposes only and we require that
the companies safeguard your personal information in
accordance with Apple's policies.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
At times we may be required by law or legal process to
disclose your personal information. We may also disclose
information about you if we believe that disclosure is
necessary for the public interest.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">How we protect your personal information</font></b>
				<br>
Apple safeguards the security of the data you send us with
physical, electronic and managerial procedures. We urge you
to take every precaution to protect your personal data when
you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a
combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a
secure browser.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
The Apple Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information
is required. To make purchases from the Apple Store, you
must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator
3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the
confidentiality of your personal and credit card information
while it is transmitted over the Internet.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">Access to your personal information</font></b>
				<br>
You always have access to the information we have about you.
To review and update your personal contact information,
simply click <a href="http://www.apple.com/contact/myinfo" target="_blank">www.apple.com/contact/myinfo</a>. If
you would like to review other personal information that
Apple may have about you, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@apple.com">privacy@apple.com</a>.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">Collecting other personal information</font></b>
				<br>
When you browse Apple’s website, you are able to do so
anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal
information when you browse — not even your email
address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us
the type of computer and operating system you are using.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
Like many websites, the Apple website uses
“cookie” technology. When you first connect to our
site, the <a href="aboutcookies.html">cookie</a>
identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The
cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about
you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on
your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of
our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are
going and how long they spend there. We use cookies to
study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site
even better.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
In some of our email to you, we use a “click-through
URL.” When you click one of these URLs, you pass
through our web server before arriving at the website that
is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us
determine your interest in particular topics and measure the
effectiveness of our customer communications.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
				<b><font size="4">Our companywide commitment to privacy</font></b>
				<br>
To make sure your personal information remains confidential,
we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Apple
employee. In addition, Apple participates in industry
initiatives—such as the Online Privacy Alliance (<a href="http://www.privacyalliance.org">http://www.privacyalliance.org</a>)
and TRUSTe—to preserve privacy rights on the Internet
and in all aspects of electronic commerce.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
Apple does not knowingly solicit personal information from
children or send them requests for personal information.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
Apple's website contains links to other sites. Apple does
not share your personal information with those websites and
is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage
you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
If we are going to use your personal information differently
from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to
contact you via email using the most recent information we
have. If you have not given us permission to communicate
with you, you will not be contacted nor will we use your
personal information in a new manner.
				<br>
				&nbsp;
				<br>
The Apple Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at
any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy
regularly for any changes.
