            2. Participating Third Party Policies
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Site may contain links to related services and offerings, including vendor sites.
            These third parties may have their own privacy statements that can be viewed on
            their websites or by contacting these third parties directly. These third parties
            who participate in our services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy
            initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However,
            since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of third parties,
            we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of those sites. We
            recommend and encourage that you always review the privacy policies of these third
            parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction
            with such parties.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">
            3. Information We Collect and How We Use It
        </h3>
        <p>
            We collect certain information from and about our users three ways: (1) directly
            from our web Server logs, (2) with Cookies, and (3) from you, the user. We do not
            collect information about the specifics of who you are ("Personally Identifiable
            Information") unless you specifically provide it to us.

                    Web Server Logs
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When you visit our Site, we may track information to administer the Site and analyze
                    its usage. None of this information is Personally Identifiable Information.
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="title">
                    Use of Cookies
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small
                    text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
                    be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
                    assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
                    the cookie to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
                    you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site,
                    a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
                    Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site
                    navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well
                    as providing personalized functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The type of information that may be stored in a cookie includes non-Personally Identifiable
                    Information about you, such as a randomly assigned user or session identification
                    number, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back
                    to the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics with third parties, but
                    will not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there is a
                    temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into our Site another site
                    that relies on third-party cookies).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                    accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.
                    If you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this
                    will disable the functionality of our Site.

                    Personal Information entered by users
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you register
                    with us, send us email messages, submit forms to us, or provide information to us
                    by any means. When you register, we will request some personal information which
                    may include your name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account
                    number, and may include other relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose
                    personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to
                    you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical
                    support and troubleshooting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us regarding
                    third parties. For instance, when you share your AppYet application with others, you
                    provide and we collect the email addresses of the people with whom you want to share
                    your application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will not sell, trade, or rent Personally Identifiable Information to others.
                    Furthermore, we will not disclose Personally Identifiable Information we collect
                    from you to third parties without your permission, except to the extent necessary:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To fulfill your service request, </li>
                    <li>To protect ourselves from liability, </li>
                    <li>To respond to a court order or subpoena, to comply with an investigation, or to
                        comply with applicable laws or rules, or </li>
                    <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we
                    in good faith believe to be unlawful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not store your credit card information on our Site. Payments for membership
                    services are made via credit card through our online transaction partner, Paypal. Please refer to Paypal's <a target="_blank" href="https://cms.paypal.com/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/Privacy_full&amp;locale.x=en_US">

                    through Paypal.

            4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files
        </h3>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to include on our Site electronic images known as web beacons
            sometimes also called single-pixel gifs that allow us to count users who have visited
            those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We reserve the right to include
            web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters in order to determine whether
            messages have been opened and acted upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            If included on our site, web beacons may be placed by third party service providers
            to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications.
            You should visit those service provider's web pages to review their privacy policies;
            see paragraph 2 above. We prohibit web beacons from being used by third parties
            to collect or access your Personally Identifiable Information.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">
            5. Accessing Web Account Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            We will provide you with the means to ensure that Personally Identifiable Information
            that we have on file for you is correct and current. You must update your Personally
            Identifiable Information promptly after it changes. You may review this information
            by <a href="mailto:appyet@gmail.com">sending us an email</a>. You may ask to
            have the information on your account deleted or removed at any time. We will use
            reasonable efforts to delete your information; however, because we and our web hosting
            company have backup systems and keep track of past transactions and/or activities,
            it may be impossible to completely delete your information.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">
            6. User Communication
        </h3>
        <p>
            We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our services. In addition, if
            you indicate upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information
            from us, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that
            may be of interest to you. Only AppYet will send you these direct mailings, and
            only if you indicated that you are interested in receiving these offers. If you
            do not want these mailings, you can tell us when you submit or edit your Personally
            Identifiable Information.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">
            7. Security of Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            We will keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure consistent with current
            industry standards. Security of your Personally Identifiable Information is of utmost
            concern to us. Personally Identifiable Information, once transmitted to us, will
            be stored on computers that only selected personnel and contractors have access
            to via password, and/or on web hosting servers maintained by Godaddy,
            which employs its own physical and network security measures. In addition, your
            AppYet applications and/or content may be stored on Godaddy servers. A copy
            of Godaddy' Privacy Policy may be obtained <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godaddy.com/Agreements/ShowDoc.aspx?pageid=PRIVACY&amp;ci=20803&amp;app_hdr=0">
                here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your AppYet application and user content are limited-access, where access is gained
            through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible
            for a third party to guess the URL address of your application or content without an invitation
            from you including the relevant URL. However, because the application and content are
            not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could
            discover your application and/or content.
        </p>
        <h3 class="title">
            8. Changes to this Statement
        </h3>
        <p>
            AppYet has the discretion to update this Statement at any time. When we do, we
            will also revise the updated date at the bottom of this Privacy page. We encourage
            you to periodically review this Statement to stay informed about how we are helping
            to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it
            is your responsibility to review this Statement periodically and become aware of
            modifications. Your continued use of this site constitutes your agreement to this
            Statement and any updates.
