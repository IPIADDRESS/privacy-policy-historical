                <h3>Your privacy is important to us</h3>

                <p>At Approved Index Ltd we value your right to privacy. However, in order to run an efficient and effective service, there is certain information about our users that we need to collect and use.</p>

                <h3>What information do we collect and why?</h3>

                <p>In general, you can browse the Approved Index website without disclosing any information about yourself at all. Submitting personal information on our site is optional.</p>
                <p>When you submit an enquiry we ask for information such as your name, email address, phone number and criteria specific to your enquiry. This information will only be released to a small number of our registered suppliers to contact you regarding the project in question.</p>
                <p>If you register your company as a supplier we ask for information such as your name, phone number, email address, address, company details, brand details and testimonials. This information may be made available to the public as a listing in our indexes. Additionally, this information may be made available to a user to whom you send a reply to an enquiry. </p>
                <p>Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy.</p>

                <h3>How do we use your personal information?</h3>

                <p>Approved Index Ltd may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation for the purpose of internal business administration and analysis. </p>
                <p>We will respect your email privacy. You will not receive unsolicited mail from Approved Index Ltd and/or from third parties. We may, however, mail you occasionally with information about Approved Index Ltd or important changes to our service. </p>
                <p>We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage in order to help develop the design and layout of our websystem.</p>
                <p>For these purposes we may send your information internationally, including to countries outside the European Economic Association. Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK. </p>

                <h3>How do we protect your personal details?</h3>

                <p>We have strict procedures governing the storage and disclosure of personal details to prevent unauthorised access and misuse. </p>
                <p>In addition, all the enquirer's personal information is password-protected: only Approved Index Ltd and the suppliers selected to receive the enquiry have access to an enquirer's personal information. </p>

                <h3>Access to your personal information</h3>

                <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal information Approved Index Ltd holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge 10 for information requests.) Please address any requests to <a href="mailto:personalinfo@approvedindex.co.uk" class="link1">personalinfo@approvedindex.co.uk</a>.</p>

		I was really surprised that the service worked so fast! Just 10 minutes after I placed
