This may include, but is not limited to: business entity name and/or your title with the applicable business entity, as well as your personal and/or business entity related e-mail address, mailing address, daytime and/or cellular telephone numbers, fax number, account information (or other information that we require in order to pay any amounts due to you under the Affiliate Network) and/or any other information requested on the applicable Subscriber registration form. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, your account information shall be considered âSensitive Information.â
</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you when you visit certain pages of this Site and/or register for an Account on the Affiliate Network and store it in log files, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows â98 or Mac OS), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, referring/exit pages, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), and share such information with our Third Party Agent.
