    Labs, Inc. (“MMTG Labs”) knows that you care about how your personal 
    information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  
    Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  
    By visiting the <a href="http://www.AppBistro.com" target="_blank">www.AppBistro.com</a> website and domain name, or otherwise 
    accessing any other linked pages, features, content, or services offered 
    from time to time by MMTG Labs in connection therewith (collectively, 
    the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices 
    and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. </font></p> 
    <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What Does This 
    Privacy Policy Cover?</font></p> 
    <p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This 
    Privacy Policy covers MMTG Labs’ treatment of personally identifiable 
    information ("Personal Information") that MMTG Labs gathers 
    when you access the Website and when you use MMTG Labs’ services.  
    This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that MMTG Labs 
    does not own or control, or to individuals that MMTG Labs does not employ 
    or manage.</font></p> 
    <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What Personal 
    Information Does MMTG Labs Collect?</font></p> 
    <p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
    information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve 
    our services. We collect the following types of information from our 
    customers:</font></p> 
    <p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Personal 
    Information You Provide to Us:</b></font></p> 
    <p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We 
    may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide 
    to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected 
    include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, 
    username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide 
    our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, 
    but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special 
    features.  The Personal Information you provide may be used for 
    such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing 
    the content you see, and communicating with you about new services.  </font> <br> 
    </p> 
    <p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Personal

      <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We receive and store 
      certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website 
      or use our services.  MMTG Labs automatically receives and records 
      information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, 
      cookie information, and the page you requested. </font></li> 
      <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Generally, our service 
      automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency 
      of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings 
      that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  MMTG 
      Labs only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical 
      measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  
      This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers 
      use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website 
      appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services.  
      As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information 
      to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website 
      or services.  We share this type of statistical data so that our 
      partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, 
      so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. 
      Again, MMTG Labs never discloses aggregate information to a partner 
      in a manner that would identify you personally.</font></li>

    often receive a confirmation when you open an email from MMTG Labs if

    receive e-mail from MMTG Labs, you can opt out of receiving further

      new cookie in a variety of ways.  We strongly recommend that you 
      leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to 
      take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features.</font></li> 
      <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Ads appearing on 
      the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who

    In other situations, MMTG Labs may provide services jointly with affiliated

    Labs, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely 
    event that MMTG Labs goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer 
    information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired 
    by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
