        AppsBuilder Srl ("AppsBuilder," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you 
        is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by 
        AppsBuilder when you use Apps-Builder.com and/or related AppsBuilder software and services (the "Service"), 
        how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion 
        of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 
    </div> 

    <div class="title_parag">Information We Collect</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        <p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> As part of using the Service, you may be required to provide certain information 
        in order to register and set up an account (including billing and credit card information), or at your option for 
        certain free Services (Registration Data). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your 
        email messages, your email address and our responses. If you invite a friend to try AppsBuilder, we will use that friend's 
        email address for the sole purpose of sending your invitation.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit Apps-Builder.com, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file 
        containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A cookie does 
        not collect personal information about you. AppsBuilder uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie 
        remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent 
        visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is 
        temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate 
        when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept 
        cookies is disabled.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>File Information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you 
        access a web page. When you view Apps-Builder.com, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser 
        sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet 
        Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, 
        pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons)
        which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information 
        from your AppsBuilder account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based 
        emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more 
        accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make AppsBuilder better for our users.</p>
        <br>
    </div> 

    <div class="title_parag">How We Use Your Information</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        <p><strong>Automatically Recorded Information:</strong> AppsBuilder does not claim any ownership in any 
        of the content, including any text, data, information, images, photographs, music, sound, video or 
        other material that you upload, transmit, store or otherwise make available in connection with the 
        Service. Such content will remain your private information. AppsBuilder's servers will automatically 
        scan and record certain information regarding your use of the Service, such as basic log information, 
        your email address, and your IP address. Such automatically recorded information shall remain your 
        private information and will not be made available to the public.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> By providing AppsBuilder your email address you consent 
        to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required 
        by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may opt out or change the frequency of many 
        Service-related communications by clicking an email preferences link provided at the end of every 
        email AppsBuilder sends. As part of our registration process we may also ask your permission to use 
        your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, 
        or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may unsubscribe or change your 
        mailing preferences by clicking a link that will appear at the end of all email communications. Opting 
        out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.<br>
        AppsBuilder may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. 
        We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, 
        and maintaining security.<br>
        We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not 
        have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized 
        content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such 
        as total number of visitors and traffic; and (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users 
        or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP.</p>

    <div class="title_parag">How We Share Your Information</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> AppsBuilder will not rent or sell your personally identifiable 
        information to others and will not share it with others except as provided herein. AppsBuilder may share your personally
        identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such 
        third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in 
        locations outside the direct control of AppsBuilder (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>
        <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information 
        is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information 
        in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</p>
        <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, AppsBuilder will not disclose personal information to any third 
        party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the 
        law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected 
        or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our License (http://www.Apps-Builder.com/legal/license), take precautions against 
        liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement 
        agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal 
        safety of AppsBuilder, our users or others.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous 
        usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help 
        them understand the usage patterns for certain AppsBuilder services.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="title_parag">How We Protect Your Information</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        AppsBuilder uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve 
        the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant 
        the security of any information you transmit to AppsBuilder and you do so at your own risk. Once we 
        receive your transmission of information, AppsBuilder makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure 
        the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information 
        may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, 
        or managerial safeguards.
    </div>

    <div class="title_parag">Compromise of Personal Information</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, 
        AppsBuilder will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, 
        in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, 
        or as otherwise required by applicable law.

    <div class="title_parag">Your Choices About Your Information</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information to AppsBuilder, 
        in which case AppsBuilder will not be able to provide the Service to you. You can review

    <div class="title_parag">Children's Privacy</div> 
    <div class="copy">
        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, AppsBuilder 
        does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13

        information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email 
        address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on AppsBuilder. 
        In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 
        13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 
        If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, 
        please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Apps-Builder.com">privacy@Apps-Builder.com</a>.
