                    <h2 id="one">1. Types of Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect two main types of information through the Services - <a href="#personalinformation">personal information</a> and <a href="#anonymousinformation">anonymous information</a> and we may also generate a third type of information, <a href="#aggregateinformation">aggregate information</a>, as set forth in more detail below. Descriptions of these terms are available in the <a href="#twelve">Definitions</a> section of the Policy.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we may collect different categories of personal, anonymous and aggregate information from you depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services.</p>
                    <h2 id="two">2. Information We Collect From Business Partners</h2>

                    <h2 id="three">3. Information We Collect From Consumers</h2>
                    <p>If you are a <a href="#consumers">Consumer</a> that downloads and uses an AppLovin App or otherwise interacts with the Services, we may collect the <a href="#deviceinformation">device information</a> identified below so that we can provide our services. We may collect and transmit such device information as either <a href="#rawdata">raw</a> or <a href="#hasheddata">hashed</a> data, depending on the sensitivity of the information in question.  AppLovin does not automatically collect any personal information directly from Consumers but may obtain such personal information from its Business Partners in connection with the Services or when Consumers submit such personal information to AppLovin via the Site.</p>

                    <h3 id="rawdata">Raw Data.</h3>
                    <p>The SDK may collect and transfer non-sensitive device information as <a href="#rawdata">raw data</a>, such as:</p>

                    <h3 id="hasheddata">Hashed Data.</h3>
                    <p>We may also collect device information that AppLovin views as being particularly sensitive. Because we understand the importance of protecting consumer privacy, we are committed to storing the following device information as <a href="#hasheddata">hashed data</a> to help prevent its unauthorized disclosure or use:</p>

                        <li>Names of the mobile applications downloaded on the Consumer’s device.</li>

                    <h2 id="four">4. How We Collect Information</h2>
                    <p>Depending on the nature of your interaction with the Services, AppLovin may collect information from you automatically and/or when you voluntarily choose to provide us with information. We may also acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you voluntarily provide to us or that we collect automatically.</p>

                    <h3 id="businesspartners">Business Partners.</h3>
                    <p>If you are a visitor to the Site or a <a href="#businesspartners">Business Partner</a>, we collect information that you voluntarily provide us during your interaction with the Services. For example, you may choose to provide AppLovin with information when you directly request information or services from us, submit or receive a payment, or complete the online forms available on the Site.</p>
                    <p>We may also collect certain types of information automatically, including through the use of <a href="#cookies">Cookies</a>, <a href="#webbeacons">Web Beacons</a> and other similar tracking technologies. These tracking technologies allow AppLovin to personalize your experience with the Services and keep track of certain online behavior in order to help us determine the things that you find most interesting.</p>
                    <h3 id="consumers">Consumers.</h3>
                    <p>AppLovin primarily collects information from <a href="#consumers">Consumers</a> when an application developer or website publisher requests AppLovin to serve an advertisement to a consumer. By downloading and using a partner Application, you grant the application developer with permission to collect device information and share it with AppLovin. AppLovin may track this information over time and across multiple AppLovin Apps (and may also combine the device information with anonymous information from other sources) in order to deliver advertisements through the Services. In addition, AppLovin may collect information from Consumers through use of a <a href="#cookies">Cookie</a>, <a href="#webbeacons">Web Beacon</a> or similar tracking technologies if the <a href="#consumers">Consumer</a> accesses advertisements from a browser or is redirected to a browser by advertisements provided through the Services.  Certain advertisements may redirect you to a browser where AppLovin may use a Cookie to track Consumer activities.</p>

                    <h2 id="five">5. Use of Your Information by AppLovin</h2>
                    <p>AppLovin uses the information we collect about you to provide the Services and to gain a better understanding of the products and services that may interest you. For example, we may use your information in order to:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>AppLovin may process and/or store personal information both within the United States and internationally.</p>
                    <p>For additional information regarding choices you may have with respect to our use of your information, please refer to the <a href="#seven">Your Choices and Controls</a> section of the Policy.</p>
                    <p>The Services may link to third party websites, non-AppLovin Apps and/or other third party content. Please note that AppLovin cannot control the treatment of your information by such third parties, and that the privacy practices of third parties likely differ from those described in the Policy.</p>

                    <h2 id="six">6. Sharing Your Information With Other Companies</h2>

AppLovin may also share your personal information with third parties if we believe in good faith that disclosure is appropriate to protect our rights, property or safety (including the enforcement of the <a href="/terms">AppLovin Terms of Use</a>, or to protect the rights, property or safety of third parties.

                        AppLovin may disclose personal information to our trusted agents and service providers so that they can perform requested services on our behalf. For example, we may share payment information with a third party service provider in order to assist us with processing credit card payments. These entities are prohibited from using your personal information for any purposes other than providing AppLovin with requested services.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <p>AppLovin provides you with the ability to exercise certain choices and controls in connection with our treatment of your information. Depending on your relationship with AppLovin, these choices and controls may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Requesting access to the personal information about you that we hold;</li>
                        <li>Correcting, updating or deleting the information associated with your AppLovin account;</li>
                        <li>Opting-out of targeted advertising delivered by AppLovin.</li>

                    <p>If you would like additional information about the choices and controls that may be available to you, or you would like to access your personal information, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Opt-Out:</h3>
                    <p>We make it easy to opt-out of our targeted advertising services. In order to do so, simply visit the <a href="/optout">Opt Out section</a> on the Site. Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive content and advertising from AppLovin. Opting-out just means that the advertisements you do receive from us will not be targeted in any sort of way.</p>

                    <h2 id="eight">8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                    <p>We do not use the Services to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of thirteen (13). We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p>

                    <h2 id="nine">9. Data Security, Integrity and Retention</h2>
                    <p>Your privacy is very important to AppLovin and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards. For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we take steps to ensure that information is stored in an anonymous format through a technique known as “<a href="#hasheddata">hashing</a>”. When a Consumer downloads and uses an App or website that requests AppLovin to serve advertisements, we may collect and process information locally on the Consumer’s mobile device. This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain <a href="#deviceinformation">device information</a> prior to transferring it to our servers for storage. Rather than sending sensitive device information as <a href="#rawdata">raw data</a> that can be easily associated with the relevant Consumer, we only transfers anonymous hashed representations of certain types of information back to AppLovin. Our servers then associate the hashed representations with a unique anonymous identifier assigned to each Consumer by AppLovin. When a Consumer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us targeted advertising without storing any sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.</p>
                    <p>AppLovin also protects Consumer privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place. For additional information regarding how we store data, please refer to the <a href="/yourprivacy">Consumer Privacy</a> portion of the Site.

                    <p>Aggregate information refers to de-identified information about groups or particular types of individuals that use the Services. Such information does not identify you as a particular individual.

If anonymous information is ever directly or indirectly associated with personal information, AppLovin will also treat the combination of data as personal information.</p>
                    <h3 id="applovinapps">AppLovin Apps.</h3>
                    <p>AppLovin Apps means the mobile applications within our network of application publishers and developers.</p>

                    <h3 id="cookies">Cookies.</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that your internet browser places on the hard drive of your device when you visit a website. We use cookies to identify your device when you return to the Site.

                    <p>Device information refers to the information automatically collected from a Consumer’s device by our SDK. Such information may be processed locally, or transferred to AppLovin for processing and/or storage.

                    <h3 id="hasheddata">Hashed Data.</h3>
                    <p>Hashing is a technique that anonymizes data. Storing information as hashed data allows AppLovin to associate certain information with a Consumer without directly affiliating him or her with personal information. AppLovin stores sensitive information in hashed form to help protect the privacy of such Consumers while providing the Services. Please refer to the <a href="#nine">Data Security, Integrity and Retention</a> of the Policy or the <a href="/yourprivacy">Consumer Privacy</a> portion of the Site for additional information about how we use “hashing” to safeguard Consumer information.</p>

By downloading and using an AppLovin App, Consumers grant the application developer with permission to collect such device information and share it with AppLovin. AppLovin may track this information over time and across multiple AppLovin Apps (and may also combine the device information with anonymous information from other sources) in order to deliver targeted advertisements through the Services.</p>
                    <h3 id="webbeacons">Web Beacons.</h3>
                    <p>A web beacon (sometimes referred to as a “pixel tag” or a “clear GIFs”) is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a website, email or other communication. Web beacons are typically one-pixel, transparent images and are used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that individual with previously acquired information about him or her in a database. AppLovin uses web beacons keep track of certain online behavior (e.g., the websites you visit, the mobile applications you use, your interaction with AppLovin emails etc.) in order to help us to determine the types of things that you find the most interesting.</p>
