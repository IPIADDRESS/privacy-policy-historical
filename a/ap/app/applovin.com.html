			</li>
			<li>

			<li>Correcting, updating or deleting the information associated with your AppLovin account;</li>
			<li>Changing your preferences regarding receiving notifications or other communications from AppLovin (e.g., emails and “push notifications”); and</li>

		<p>If you would like additional information about the choices and controls that may be available to you, or you would like to access your personal information, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
		<p>We make it easy to opt-out of our interest-based advertising services. In order to do so, simply complete the&nbsp;<a href="/optout">Opt Out form</a>&nbsp;on the Site. Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive content and advertising from AppLovin. Opting-out just means that the advertisements you do receive from us will not be based on your interests, preferences or behavior.</p>

		<h2 id="eight">8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
		<p>We do not use the Services to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of thirteen (13). We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly&nbsp;<a href="/contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p>

		<h2 id="nine">9. Data Security, Integrity and Retention</h2>
		<p>Your privacy is very important to AppLovin and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards. For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.</p>
		<p>In addition, we take steps to ensure that sensitive information is stored in an anonymous format through a technique known as “<a href="#hasheddata">hashing</a>”. When a Consumer downloads and uses an AppLovin App, our&nbsp;<a href="#sdk">SDK</a>&nbsp;helps to collect and process information locally on the Consumer’s mobile device. This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain&nbsp;<a href="#deviceinformation">device information</a>&nbsp;prior to transferring it to our servers for storage. Rather than sending sensitive device information as&nbsp;<a href="#rawdata">raw data</a>&nbsp;that can be easily associated with the relevant Consumer, the SDK only transfers anonymous hashed representations of certain types of information back to AppLovin. Our servers then associate the hashed representations with a unique anonymous identifier assigned to each Consumer by AppLovin. When a Consumer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us to identify that Consumer and provide social content and personalized advertising without storing his or her sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.</p>
		<p>AppLovin also protects Consumer privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place. For additional information regarding how we store data, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/yourprivacy">Consumer Privacy</a>&nbsp;portion of the Site. You may also&nbsp;<a href="/contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;anytime with your questions or concerns.</p>
		<h2 id="ten">10. Changes to the Policy</h2>
		<p>We may, in our sole discretion, make changes to the Policy from time to time in order to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. The most recent version of the Policy will always be posted on the Site. If we do make any changes, we will also update the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy and we may provide you with other forms of notice, such as email. We encourage you to review the Policy periodically to ensure that you understand how we collect, use and share information through the Services.</p>
		<p>Any changes to the Policy will become effective when the revised Policy is posted on the Site. By continuing to use the Services following such changes, you are agreeing to accept the terms of the revised Policy.</p>
