During registration, AppointmentQuest asks for your name, email address, zip code, and a few other optional details about you. That information will assist the provider in identifying you as a client and give you a priority in reserving your request for an appointment.</p><p><b><a name="cookies"></a></b><b>Why we do not use cookies?</b></p><p>Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your computerâ€™s hard drive. Using cookies is an insecure way of gathering information from people who use the site since they make it possible to track your Internet activity even after you leave a web site. We are proud to inform you that our site DOES NOT use cookies and therefore, AppointmentQuest does not collect any additional information other than that which you provided during registration.</p><p><b><a name="how"></a></b><b>How does AppointmentQuest use my information?</b></p><p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide the businesses you wish to make appointments with the information to allow them to recognize or contact you in case they need to modify the appointment or to verify it. You will only receive special offers via email from AppointmentQuest if you have indicated in your account preferences that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at any time.</p><p>We may research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. Purpose of such research is to better understand and serve our users.</p><p><b><a name="who"></a></b><b>Who is collecting information?</b></p><p>When you are on a AppointmentQuest site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with AppointmentQuest alone. We do not share any information other then name, address, telephone number and email with the provider you requested an appointment with, in order to identify you as a prospective client.</p><p><b><a name="share"></a></b><b>With whom does AppointmentQuest share my information?</b></p><p>As a general rule, AppointmentQuest will not disclose any of your personal information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Please see our Terms of Service for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p><p><u>Providers</u>: AppointmentQuest will have to share some of your personal information with the provider you request an appointment with, such as name, address, phone number and email.</p><p><u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>: Under confidentiality agreements, AppointmentQuest may match user information with third party data. Also, AppointmentQuest discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 55% of our users are between 20 and 40 years of age) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p><p><u>Other:</u> AppointmentQuest may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating AppointmentQuest's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) AppointmentQuest's rights or property, other AppointmentQuest's users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. AppointmentQuest may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p><p><b><a name="choice"></a></b><b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</b></p><p>AppointmentQuest will not send you junk email or email promotions, we believe that if you want to buy something you can find it on your own.</p><p>AppointmentQuest does not sell or rent user information to anyone.</p><p><b><a name="update"></a></b><b>What is AppointmentQuest's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?</b></p><p>You may edit your User Profile at any time by using your AppointmentQuest's ID and password. If you have forgotten your password, you can click the hyperlink on that screen to receive your password in email.</p><p>Your account with AppointmentQuest can be deleted , but doing so will result in not being able to set any appointments with a provider until you decide to re-enter your account with us.</p><p><b><a name="financial"></a></b><b>How does AppoitnmentQuest protect my personal financial and health-related information?</b></p><p>Keeping your personal information private is vitally important to us. As with all information, AppointmentQuest will never rent or sell your personal information.</p><p>In order to serve you better we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners our aggregate data that does not include any personal information about any individual user.</p><p><b><a name="security"></a></b><b>How can I protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b></p><p>Your AppointmentQuest Account Information and AppointmentQuest User Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.</p><p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. AppointmentQuest will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of your AppointmentQuest account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p><p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, AppointmentQuest cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p><p><b><a name="children"></a></b><b>What about children's privacy?</b></p><p>Our AppointmentQuest.com Internet site is a general audience web site.</p><p>Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online. AppointmentQuest does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, AppointmentQuest will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.</p><p><b><a name="else"></a></b><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></p><p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p><p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p><p><b><a name="notification"></a></b><b>Notification of changes</b></p><p>We will notify you directly via email if there is a material change in our privacy practices.
