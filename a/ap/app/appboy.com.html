  <h1 class="bold">APPBOY PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  <p class="bold">Last Revised May 30, 2013</p>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Appboy collects information through the use of applications created and distributed by third party
      developers that integrate Appboy software or services ("Developer Applications"). This privacy policy
      describes Appboyâ€™s collection of information from end users of mobile devices who have downloaded a
      Developer Application that integrates Appboy services and from visitors to our website.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This privacy policy <span class="underline">does not</span> govern any collection or disclosure of information by third parties, including
      Developer Applications. For a complete description of information gathered by any particular Developer
      Application, see the privacy policy for that Developer Application. If you believe an Developer Application
      uses Appboy software or services but does not have a privacy policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@appboy.com">info@appboy.com</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">What information does Appboy collect?</h1>
      <p>Appboy collects information through use of Developer Applications, including:</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Device Information</span> - We collect information about devices running Developer Applications, including
      platform, a unique Appboy-generated ID, OS version, IP address, carrier information, and a country code.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Application Usage Information</span> - We collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such
      as the frequency and duration of usage.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Website Information</span> - We may collect information provided on our website such as contact information or
      feedback. Additionally, we may use cookies and web beacons to monitor traffic patterns and collect
      information about previous visits to our web site.</p>
      <p><span class="underline">Personally Identifiable Information</span> - We may collect personally identifiable information shared with
      Developer Applications. We may also collect personally identifiable information from third parties used for
      authentication, such as when a user logs in to a Developer Application using a Facebook account, and
      from third party partners such as Facebook, Twitter, and Klout. Personally identifiable information
      collected may include name, email address, location, gender, interests, device, app usage, user ID, and
      contact information.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">Does Appboy collection real time location information?</h1>
      <p>Appboy may collect device location information if location services are enabled for any Developer
      Applications on the device. We use location information to provide Developers with information about the
      use of their Developer Applications and to assist in serving advertisements. Anonymous location
      information may be shared with advertising partners and Developers for their independent use. See the
      "Opt-out" section below for details on limiting the collection of location information.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">How does Appboy use information collected from you?</h1>
      <p><span class="underline">Appboy Internal Use</span> - We use information we collect to provide partner Developers and advertisers with
      information about usage of Developer Applications that integrate the Appboy Service.</p>
      <p>We will share information we collect with third parties only in ways described in this privacy statement.</p>
      <p>We may disclose information we collect :</p>
      <p>to third party advertising partners;</p>
      <p>to third parties as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</p>
      <p>to third parties as we deem necessary, based on our good faith belief, (i) to protect our rights, user safety
      or the safety of others, (ii) to investigate fraud, or (iii) to respond to a government request;</p>
      <p>to trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the
      information we disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy
      statement;</p>
      <p>to third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of Appboy. If Appboy is involved in a
      merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, affected users will be notified via email and/or
      a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any
      choices users may have regarding this information;</p>
      <p>to advertisers and third-party advertising networks and as described below under the Section entitled
      Automatic Data Collection and Advertising;</p>
      <p>to Developers in the form of aggregated, anonymous data about the way Developer Applications are used
      so that Developers can improve their respective Developer Applications.
      We use information about you collected from third party partners in compliance with the terms set forth by
      those third parties.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h1>
      <p>We automatically collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such as the frequency
      and duration of usage. This includes details about mobile devices, such as a unique Appboy-generated
      ID for the mobile device. We share anonymous information about use of Developer Applications with
      Developers and analytics companies, including which Developer Applications users have downloaded
      and the way those Developer Applications are used, which facilitates improvements to Developer
      Applications. We may also provide information about use of Developer Applications to our advertising
      partners.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 class="article_title">Opt-out</h1>
      <p>You may opt out of the collection of location information by turning off location services for Developer
      Applications on your mobile device. You may opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information
      by not providing that information to Developer Applications. You can prevent collection of personally
      identifiable information from third parties such as Facebook or Twitter by not logging in to Developer
      Applications using your Facebook or Twitter account.
      You can prevent collection of all information by uninstalling Developer Applications that integrate the
      Appboy Service.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to email <a href="mailto:privacy@appboy.com">privacy@appboy.com</a>.</p>

      limit access to this information to authorized employees who need to know that information in order to
