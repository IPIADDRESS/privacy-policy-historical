      <p>Appboy collects information through the use of applications created and distributed by third party developers
        that integrate Appboy software or services ("Developer Applications"). This privacy policy governs Appboy’s
        collection of information from end users of mobile devices who have downloaded a Developer Application that
        integrates Appboy services but who have not registered with Appboy ("Non-Registered Users").

      </p><p>

      </p><p>This privacy policy <span class="underline">does not</span> govern Appboy’s collection of information from end
        users who register with Appboy ("Registered Users"). Appboy’s collection of information from Registered Users is
        governed by the privacy policy found at <a href="#registered">https://www.appboy.com/privacy#registered.</a></p>

      <p>This privacy policy <span class="underline">does not</span> govern any collection or disclosure of information

        Applications, including platform, a unique Appboy-generated ID for your device, OS version, IP address, carrier
        information, and a country code.</p>

      <p><span class="underline">Personally Identifiable Information</span> - We do not collect personally identifiable
        information from Non-Registered Users. However, the unique Appboy-generated ID for your device could later be

      <h1 class="article_title">Does Appboy collection real time location information?</h1>

      <p>Appboy may collect information about the location of your device if location services are enabled for any
        Developer Applications on your device. We use location information to provide Developers with information about
        the use of their Developer Applications and to assist in serving advertisements. Anonymous location information
        may be shared with advertising partners and Developers for their independent use. See the "Opt-out" section
        below for details on limiting the collection of location information.</p>

        provide partner Developers and advertisers with anonymous information about the usage of Developer Applications
        that integrate the Appboy Service.</p>

      <p>We will share information collected from Non-Registered Users with third parties only in ways described in this
        privacy statement.</p>

      <p>We may disclose information we collect from Non-Registered Users:

      </p>

      <p>to third parties as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;
      </p>

      <p>to third parties as we deem necessary, based on our good faith belief, (i) to protect our rights, your safety
        or the safety of others, (ii) to investigate fraud, or (iii) to respond to a government request;</p>

      <p>to trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information we
        disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy statement;</p>

      <p>to third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of Appboy. If Appboy is involved in a
        merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a
        prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices
        you may have regarding this information;</p>

      <p>to advertisers and third-party advertising networks and as described below under the Section entitled Automatic
        Data Collection and Advertising;</p>

      <p>to Developers in the form of aggregated, anonymous data about the way you use Developer Applications so that
        Developers can improve their respective Developer Applications.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 class="article_title">Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h1>

      <p>We automatically collect information about your use of Developer Applications, such as the frequency and
        duration of usage. This includes details about your mobile device, such as a unique Appboy-generated ID for your
        mobile device. We share anonymous information about your use of Developer Applications with Developers and
        analytics companies, including which Developer Applications you have downloaded and the way you use those
        Developer Applications, which facilitates improvements to Developer Applications. We may also provide
        information about your use of Developer Applications to our advertising partners.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1 class="article_title">Opt-out</h1>

      <p>You may opt out of the collection of location information by turning off location services for Developer
        Applications on your mobile device. You can prevent collection of all information by disabling Appboy through
        the Settings screen in the Appboy user interface on a per-app basis, or by uninstalling Developer Applications
        that integrate the Appboy Service.</p>

    <p class="bold">Last Revised June 4, 2012</p>
    <section>
      <h1 class="article_title">Introduction</h1>

      <p>This privacy policy governs your use of Appboy software, services and websites (collectively, the "Service").
        The Service is offered to users who establish an account with us through mobile applications created by third

        Twitter®, learn about new mobile applications and interact with developers of applications that you use.

      </p><p>

      </p><p>This privacy policy <span class="underline">does not</span> govern Appboy’s collection of information from end
        users who have not registered with Appboy ("Non-Registered Users"). Appboy’s collection of information from
