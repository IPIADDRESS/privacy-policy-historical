        </p><p><span class="underline">Device Information</span> - We collect information about devices running Developer Applications, including platform, a unique Appboy-generated ID for your device, OS version, IP address, carrier information, and a country code.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Application Usage Information</span> - We collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such as the frequency and duration of usage.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Website Information</span> - We may collect information you provide on our website such as contact information or feedback. Additionally, we may use cookies and web beacons to monitor traffic patterns and collect information about your previous visits to our web site.</p>

        <p>We will share information collected from Non-Registered Users with third parties only in ways described in this privacy statement.</p>

            <li>to trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy statement;</li>
            <li>to third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of Appboy. If Appboy is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information;</li>
            <li>to advertisers and third-party advertising networks and as described below under the Section entitled Automatic Data Collection and Advertising;</li>
            <li>to Developers in the form of aggregated, anonymous data about the way you use Developer Applications so that Developers can improve their respective Developer Applications.</li>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Changes</h3>
