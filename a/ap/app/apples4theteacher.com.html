          <p>The success of the online advertising industry relies upon user   participation and acceptance of online marketing methods. Because of   this, Tribal Fusion holds user privacy policy concerns to the highest   regard. We expect our publisher partners to do the same and thus require   all our publishers to maintain a publically accessible, up-to-date and   accurate user privacy policy for all sites running Tribal Fusion   advertising. </p>
          <p>A privacy policy is simply a statement to your visitors of how   personal information is collected and used by your web property. Even if   you do not collect personal information, you still need a privacy   policy stating this. </p>
          <p>Tribal Fusion does not require a specific format for your user   privacy policy. We do request, however, that your privacy policy is both   fair and accurate, and states that you run advertising on your site   that involves the use of cookies to monitor their success.

  <br>
          NetSeer's web servers                    automatically collect                    non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") about Site visitors,                      such as demographic                      information (age, gender, city or state), and "click stream data."

          <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong><br>
          As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience   for all recipients of ValueClick Media advertising, we may use log   files, web beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser   and third party sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The   Information collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to   determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more   effectively match advertisements and website content to your interests,   assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to   maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our   business partners and clients and enables us to provide general   statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of   ValueClick Media’s services.<br>
  <br>
  “Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including   your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,   referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and   types of advertisements viewed.<br>
  <br>
  "Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a   website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions,   submittal of applications and browsing behavior.<br>
  <br>
  "Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your   Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, BlackBerry or   other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have   when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks   on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through   destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an   advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows   advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the   audience they reach. Cookies are also used to control the delivery of a   series of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of   times a web browser receives any one advertisement.<br>
  <br>
          There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your   system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to the   Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent   Cookies” remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the   Sites and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites   and provide more relevant content to you on such Sites.<br>
  <br>
          There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try   to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or   otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or   any other PII. ValueClick Media does not and cannot use Cookies or web   beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.<br>

        <p><strong>Cox Digital Solutions Corporation: Privacy Policy for Consumers &amp; Opt-Out Program</strong><br>
          January 2011<br>
  <br>
          Cox Digital Solutions is committed to privacy and to giving you choice   in the advertising that you view. This privacy policy explains the types   of data we collect, how we use it, and how long we keep it.  We also   provide you with the ability to opt out from receiving targeted   advertising from advertisers and publishers (i.e., website owners) using   our services. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What we DON’T Collect:</strong> Cox   Digital Solutions does not collect any personally identifiable   information.  This is information that would allow someone to know both   your name and contact or financial information such as a telephone   number, email address, complete street address, or credit card number. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>About Children: </strong>Children are people too.  We don’t collect children’s (or anyone else’s) personal information. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What do we Collect? </strong>To   deliver the most relevant advertising to you, Cox Digital Solutions   collects anonymous data when you visit a site that uses our services.   That data may include the URL of the site or page you visited, your IP   address (which provides some level of geographic detail more general   than zip codes), the time of day, and the category of ads that were   presented to you or that you interacted with.  We may collect   information regarding the interaction (for example, pausing or rewinding   a video advertisement). We may collect information that tells us what   led you to the site within Cox Digital Solutions (referring URL or   search query). This information is stored on our servers with a random   numeric id – and we store that numeric ID, encrypted, in your browser as   a cookie.  Collectively, we refer to all of this information as “cookie   targeting data”.  None of this information can be used to personally   identify you. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What we do with the data we collect: </strong>Using   the cookie targeting data, we can specify characteristics shared by   groups of users that may be desired for an advertising campaign (we only   target ads against aggregated information).  We can also use cookie   targeting data to affect the number of times you are presented with a   particular ad or set of ads within a period of time (so-called   “frequency-capping”).  For example, a pet food producer would like to   present its product to consumers who live in the San Francisco Bay Area   and are possibly interested, based on browsing history, in pets.  If we   determine that the Cox Digital Solutions cookie on your browser may be   associated with viewing pet-related website and with an IP address in   the San Francisco Bay Area, you may be more likely to be presented with   an advertisement from that producer.  And we determine otherwise, you   may be less likely to be presented with an advertisement from that   producer.  Cox Digital Solutions does not have a mechanism for   advertisers to know the personal identity of the person receiving the   targeted advertisements.  We may share with third parties aggregated,   non-personally identifiable information, such as the number of users who   visit a publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a   particular advertisement. This information does not identify you   individually.  The examples of our use of cookie targeting information   are not comprehensive.  In general, we will use cookie targeted data to   facilitate the requirements of advertisers so long as such use does not   personally identify you.  Website Privacy Policies.  We encourage you to review the privacy   policies of the websites that you visit. You should contact website   publishers directly should you have questions concerning their use of   your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not   wish to receive. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How long do we keep the Data? </strong>Cox   Digital Solutions stores cookie targeting data is for 60 days.  Certain   data, such as the category of ads on specific sites and pages are   retained, in aggregate, to inform our decision engine for serving the   most relevant ads to any consumer on a non-targeted basis.    Frequency-capping cookie data is retained on the consumer’s browser for   as long as specified in specific campaign requirements.  Cox Digital   Solutions’s servers do not store frequency-capping cookie data. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Opt Out Program. </strong> As part of our commitment to giving you control and transparency, we   provide you with a way to determine if your browser has an Cox Digital   Solutions cookie and a way to opt-out of receiving cookie-targeted   online ads from networks hosted on Cox Digital Solutions’s platform. <a href="http://www.coxdigitalsolutions.com/privacy_policy/consumer-opt-out-program">Click here to learn more</a>.<br>
