			<h2>Privacy Practices for Our Platform</h2>
			<h3>Overview of the AdNexus Platform</h3>
			<p>
				AdNexus offers an advertising technology platform (“Platform”) that enables our Clients to buy and sell online advertising. Some of our Clients may collect Non-PII about an Internet user’s web surfing habits, and use that Non-PII to deliver more relevant advertising via the Platform. Similarly, we sometimes obtain Non-PII from our data partners and enable our Clients to use that Non-PII via the Platform. And we collect Non-PII via the Platform for ad delivery and reporting purposes. Generally, an Internet user's computer comes into contact with the Platform when he or she visits a website, or views an ad that is delivered by the Platform. The ads delivered by the Platform are sent from the domain adnxs.com.
			</p>
			<p>
				We contractually require Clients to adhere to online privacy and security laws in their use of the Platform. We also prohibit Clients from importing PII into the Platform, or otherwise using PII on the Platform. And we take reasonable steps to avoid receiving PII from Clients via the Platform. However, as a technology Platform, we are unable to be in complete control of the type of information that our Clients import into the Platform.
			</p>
			<h2>Types of Information We Collect Via the Platform</h2>
			<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
			<p>
				We don't collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via the Platform, and take reasonable measures to avoid receiving PII from Clients via the Platform.
			</p>
			<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
			<p>
				We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) via the Platform, including but not limited to an Internet user’s IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, the URL, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and his or her computer's operating system. 
			</p>
			<h3>Cookies and Web beacons</h3>
			<p>
				Our Clients use cookies in conjunction with Web beacons when they use the Platform in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you. We also use cookies and Web beacons (under the domain adnxs.com) to help our clients make advertising more relevant. We also use cookies and web beacons for ad delivery and reporting purposes, to measure the success of our Clients’ online advertising campaigns.
			</p>			
			<h2>Controlling the Use of Your Information</h2>
			<h3>Opting out from Cookies</h3>
			<p>
				If you’d like to opt-out from having AdNexus collect your Non-PII in connection with our Platform, please <a href="http://ib.adnxs.com/optout">click here</a>. When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to help us tailor our Clients’ online advertisement campaigns. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
			</p>
			<h3>Deleting your PII</h3>
			<p>
				Although we don’t collect PII via our Platform, if you'd like us to update, correct, delete or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us on the Website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com">adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.
			</p>
			<h2>Information Security</h2>
			<p>
				The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com">adnxs-privacy@adnexus.com</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>Information Relating to Children</h2>
			<p>
				Our products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.
			</p>
			<h2>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
			<p>
				We do not collect PII via the Platform, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Website with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may share Non-PII collected via the Platform with Clients. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via the Platform with Non-PII collected from Clients. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
			</p>
			<h2>Storage of Information</h2>
			<p>
				We retain PII collected via the Website for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.
			</p>
			<p>
				We don’t collect PII via the Platform. We retain the Non-PII collected via the Platform for up to 12 months, after which time the information is rendered anonymous and may be stored for up to two years.
			</p>
			<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				This privacy policy is subject to change. If we make any material or substantive changes in the way that we use the PII collected through this Website, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of those changes on the Website and in this privacy policy.
			</p>
