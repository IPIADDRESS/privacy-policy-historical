		<p><span class="content3">Privacy Policy</span></p>

		<p><strong>StormSource Software, Inc. dba Appointment-Plus</strong> ("Appointment-Plus") respects your privacy and the privacy of your customers.

We request this information so that we may register you for our service, and customize our application to meet the specific needs of your business or profession. In addition, we use such information as a mailing list to periodically provide you information to assist you in setting up and utilizing Appointment-Plus.</p>

		<p>By collecting some information about you, we are able to deliver relevant information to you about Appointment-Plus services (never third party services). You have the option of opting out of any Appointment-Plus mailings such as the Appointment-Plus monthly newsletter. Appointment-Plus may disclose or access account information in the event the law requires such disclosure and for administrative or related purposes to maintain and improve our services to you. Appointment-Plus will never share personally-identifiable information about you, your business or your customers with any third party without receiving your permission, unless required to do so by law.</p>

We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's personally-identifiable information from the existing files.</p>

		<p><span class="content7">Security</span><br>
		Our Web site has high security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

		Credit card transactions are processed by third party gateways such as Authorize.net, Merchant Ware, Linkpoint, Paypal, etc. which have confidentiality of transactions covered by their privacy policies. These gateways offer secure encrypted credit card transactions for thousands of companies and have stringent security measures in place.</p>

		<p><span class="content7">Communication of Changes</span><br>
