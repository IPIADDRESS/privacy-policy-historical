	<p>As used in this Privacy 
	Policy, "ngmoco", "we", "us", or "our" 
	refer to ngmoco, LLC, and all of its subsidiaries.  
	</p> 
	<p>Your privacy is important 
	to ngmoco.  We designed our Privacy Policy to cover how we collect, 
	use, disclose, transfer and store your information.  Please familiarize 
	yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any 
	questions. </p> 
	<p>Our Privacy Policy applies 
	only to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that 
	you may decide to provide to us in your use of: (i) our applications 
	for mobile platforms or devices and our web applications accessible 
	on third party social networking services ("<strong>SNS</strong>") (collectively, 
	our mobile and web applications are referred to herein as ("<strong>ngmoco 
	Applications</strong>"), (ii) our game publisher networks, crowd sourcing 
	service and platforms ("<strong>Networks</strong>") provided in connection 
	with ngmoco Applications and Third-Party Mobile Applications (defined 
	below), (iii) our portal for third-party publishers ("<strong>mobage Developer 
	Portal</strong>"), (iv) our web domains and subdomains, including <a href="http://ngmoco.com" target="_blank">ngmoco.com</a>, 
	<a href="http://plusplus.com" target="_blank">plusplus.com</a> and <a href="http://mobage.com" target="_blank">mobage.com</a> (collectively, our "<strong>Sites</strong>"), 
	and web forums or messaging boards in ngmoco Applications and our Sites 
	(collectively, our "<strong>Forums</strong>").  Any and all of our ngmoco 
	Applications, Networks, mobage Developer Portal, Sites and Forums are 
	referred to herein as our "<strong>Services</strong>". </p> 
	<p>We reserve the right 
	to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy 
	Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in our Services and 
	on the Sites along with the updated Privacy Policy. We will also update 
	the "Last Updated Date" in the Privacy Policy. By continuing to 
	access or use the Services after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy 
	or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating 
	that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified 
	Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease 
	using the Services. </p> 
	<p>Please visit this page 
	periodically to remain up-to-date as to any Privacy Policy changes. 
	Take a moment now to read the following to learn about our information 
	collection practices that may impact you as a registered user with full 
	access to our Services or a non-registered user of our Services (each 
	a "<strong>ngmoco User</strong>"). For information regarding the collection 
	and use of Personal Information (defined below) from children under 
	14 years old, see the Section below, entitled "Our Policy Toward Children".  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>We Collect Personal 
	Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong></p> 
	<p>In the course of using 
	our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable 
	information that can be used to contact or identify you.  Personally 
	identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, 
	phone number, photo representation ("<strong>avatar</strong>"), email address 
	and mailing address ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").  We will 
	collect, use, transfer and disclose Personal Information in accordance 
	with our Privacy Policy. </p> 
	<p>We also collect non-personal 
	information, which is data in a form that does not permit direct association 
	with you or any specific individual ("<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>").  
	Non-Identifying Information is aggregated and used to help improve our 
	Services and Third Party Mobile Applications (defined below) by providing 
	a better way to understand the ngmoco User experience with the level 
	of interest in various portions of our Sites, specific ngmoco Applications 
	or specific Third-Party Mobile Applications. We may collect, use, transfer 
	and disclose Non-Identifying Information for any purpose; details provided 
	in this Privacy Policy about what Non-Identifying Information we collect 
	currently, and how we use, transfer and disclose such Non-Identifying 
	Information concern only how such information is collected and used 
	today.  </p> 
	<p>Both Personal Information 
	or Non-Identifying Information may be used alone or in the aggregate 
	with information collected from other ngmoco Users. Our primary objective 
	in collecting any Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information 
	is to provide you with a superior and personally relevant user experience.  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>How we use your Personal Information</strong></p> 
	<p>Your Personal Information may be used, for instance:</p> 
	<ul> 
	  <li>To help us to develop, deliver, and improve our Services and advertising;</li> 
	  <li>To recommend products of interest directly to you;</li> 
	  <li>For market research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community of ngmoco Users;
	    <ul> 
	      <li>For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with announcements, newsletters and promotional materials related to our Services or to offer you opportunities to participate  in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a "Promotion") via our Services.
	        <ul> 
	          <li>If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "Changing or Removing Information" below for further information.)</li> 
	        </ul> 
	      </li> 
	    </ul> 
	  </li> 
	  <li>To allow us to keep you posted regarding our latest Service announcements, software updates, and upcoming events;</li> 
	  <li>To send important notices, such as communications about your purchases and changes to our <a href="http://www.ngmoco.com/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, or other Service-specific   policies. Because this information is important to your interactions with ngmoco, you may not opt out of receiving these communications; and</li> 
	  <li>To audit and analyze data to improve our Services and customer communications.</li> 
	</ul> 

	<p><strong>When We Collect Information</strong></p> 
	<p>One of the instances 
	when we collect your Personal Information is in connection with your 
	registration on our Services. </p> 
	<p>If you are an ngmoco 
	User, you can register either via an ngmoco Application or via a third-party 
	application utilizing our Services ("<strong>Third Party Mobile Application</strong>") 
	that was designed for mobile telephones or other mobile devices by a 
	third-party publisher ("<strong>Third Party Publisher</strong>").  
	</p> 
	<p>In connection with registration 
	of ngmoco Users on our Services, we collect Personal Information which 
	may include your email address, as well as information on mobile device 
	type, mobile carrier, unique mobile device identifier ("Device ID"), 
	Internet Protocol ("IP") address and geo location, as applicable. 
	We use your Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand 
	your use of our Services, or the Third Party Mobile Application that 
	you may choose to access through our Services. </p> 
	<p>Related to this information 
	collection, our Services may serve ads that contain links to other Third-Party 
	Mobile Applications, and we may utilize your Device ID to track clicks 
	or other ad fulfillment metrics. Our use of your Device ID does not 
	enable us to identify you personally, and we do not store this information 
	in connection with your ngmoco User account information.  
	</p> 
	<p>If you are a Third Party 
	Publisher, you can register to develop Third Party Mobile Applications 
	via our Sites. In connection with registration as a Third Party Publisher, 
	we may collect your name, mailing address, email address and telephone 
	number. We collect this Personal Information to ensure that we are able 
	to contact you. </p> 
	<p>You may also be asked 
	explicitly to provide Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information 
	anytime that you are in contact with ngmoco or an ngmoco-affiliated 
	company.  If your Personal Information or Non-Identifying Information 
	is shared with our affiliates, such sharing will be in accordance with 
	this Privacy Policy. </p> 
	<p>Other instances when 
	Personal Information may be collected via our Services include the following:  
	</p> 
	<p>If you choose to link 
	your ngmoco account to an SNS, Personal Information that you independently 
	submit to an SNS (e.g., Facebook) may be collected and used by us in 
	order to provide you with enhanced functionality. In these instances, 
	you consent to ngmoco’s access and use of your username, alias and 
	any other Personal Information you have independently provided to and 
	made accessible through the SNS. Such access will be in accordance with 
	the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Similarly, 
	we may use Personal Information that you have provided to us to help 
	you establish social connections with other ngmoco Users.  
	</p> 
	<p>If you choose to participate 
	in a Promotion, We may request that you provide us with Personal Information 
	such as your email address or mailing address in order to administer 
	your participation in the Promotion. </p> 
	<p>In connection with use 
	of our Services or Third-Party Mobile Applications, in addition to information 
	on device type, mobile carrier, IP address, platform version, and geo-location, 
	as applicable, we may also collect navigation, interaction and engagement 
	information regarding ngmoco Users.</p> 
	<p> </p> 
	<p>Certain Non-Identifying 
	Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information 
	if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip 
	code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. 
	But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information 
	when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying 
	Information (e.g., your viewing preferences).   
	</p> 
	<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Other 
	Technologies</strong></p> 
	<p>As is standard practice, 
	we use "cookies" to help us study traffic patterns and understand 
	the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small 
	string of text that we send to your computer’s or mobile device’s 
	browser. Other types of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection 
	with our Services are only used to obtain browser-specific information.  
	For example, we do not use cookies to retrieve data from your hard drive, 
	pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies we 
	use can reveal, for instance, which pages are the most popular, how 
	much time ngmoco Users are spending there, and how they are interacting 
	with the content on such pages. </p> 
	<p>You have the option to 
	disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting 
	cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the pages you 
	visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to 
	view or use all portions of our Services due to limited functionality.  
	</p> 
	<p>Some of our Services, 
	including email messaging, use "click-through URLs" linked 
	to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to 
	help us determine interest in topics, Services usability and other measures 
	of ngmoco User engagement. </p> 
	<p>We may also use "pixel 
	tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar 
	means (individually or collectively "<strong>Pixel Tags</strong>") in connection 
	with our Services and to collect usage, demographic and geographical 
	location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel 
	that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies 
	on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have 
	visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services and 
	to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.  
	</p> 
	<p>When you use our Services 
	or Third-Party Mobile Applications, our servers automatically record 
	information that your browser or the applicable Service or Third-Party 
	Mobile Application sends ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may 
	include information such as your computer’s or mobile device’s IP 
	address, browser type, language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring 
	and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date 
	stamp, clickstream data and other statistics. We use this information 
	to monitor, analyze and understand trends, for technical administration 
	of Services and Third-Party Mobile Applications, and to gather demographic 
	information about our ngmoco User base as a whole.  We, and Third 
	Party Publishers may use this information for product and services improvements, 
	and in marketing and advertising services. </p> 
	<p>BY CLICKING ON THE "SIGN UP" 
	BUTTON, WHERE APPLICABLE, OR OTHERWISE BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES 
	YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES 
	ON YOUR DEVICE. </p> 
	<p><strong>When We Disclose Your 
	Information Within ngmoco Services</strong></p> 
	<p>As a user with an account, 
	you may create your own profile, connect with other ngmoco Users of 
	Services, send messages and transmit information through various channels. 
	Please remember that any communications you have via our Services, depending 
	on, for example, the functionality of any ngmoco Application or Third-Party 
	Mobile Application connected to our Services, may reveal your screen 
	name and the content of your communications, making this information 
	publicly available to other ngmoco Users. ngmoco is not responsible 
	for the activities of other ngmoco Users or other third parties with 
	whom you choose to provide your Personal Information or otherwise interact.  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>With Third Parties 
	for Industry Analysis</strong></p> 
	<p>In addition to sharing 
	aggregated Non-Identifying Information with Third Party Publishers, 
	we may also share aggregated Non-Identifying Information with advertisers 
	and ad networks ("<strong>Advertising Entities</strong>") with whom we have 
	strategic relationships. Unless you specifically opt in to share your 
	Personal Information, the information that we share with these third 
	parties will only be used in the form of Non-Identifying Information 
	to support user trend analyses and demographic profiling. Some Third 
	Party Publishers and Advertising Entities also act as Service Providers 
	(defined below) to us, so in those cases we will share your information 
	as described below. </p> 
	<p><strong>With Preferred Partners</strong></p> 
	<p>We may share your username, 
	email address and Device ID (collectively, "<strong>Specific Shared Data</strong>") 
	with certain of our Third Party Publishers and other business partners 
	("<strong>Preferred Partners</strong>") for those parties to assist us with 
	providing you with the aspect of the Services for which you provided 
	such Specific Shared Data to us, and to use such Specific Shared Data 
	to provide you with information and marketing materials about Third 
	Party Mobile Applications and other products and services in order, 
	for example, to further enhance your use of our Services and to augment 
	your gaming and social networking experience generally. In addition, 
	in the event of a user inquiry concerning Third Party Publishers or 
	Third Party Applications, we may send Specific Shared Data as well as 
	the inquiry to the Third Party Publisher to address the inquiry.   
	</p> 
	<p>We only share such information 
	with Preferred Partners pursuant to an agreement by which the Preferred 
	Partner is under obligations not to disclose or use it for any other 
	purpose. You may contact us by any of the means provided in the "Contacting 
	Us" section below to request not to have such information provided 
	to Preferred Partners, understanding, however, that if such information 
	is not shared with Preferred Partners it may affect your ability to 
	use or access portions of the Services. </p> 
	<p>Some Preferred Partners 
	also act as Service Providers (defined below) to us, and in those cases 
	we may also share Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information 
	as described below.  </p> 
	<p><strong>With Third 
	Party Social Networking Services (SNSs)</strong></p> 
	<p>As a user with an account, 
	you may link your ngmoco account information with certain SNSs where 
	other ngmoco Users have existing SNS accounts. In these instances, with 
	your permission and on your behalf, we will share your email address 
	and screen name or alias with the applicable SNS. Through use of such 
	services’ application programming interfaces (APIs) we can receive 
	certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in 
	accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, 
	if any. </p> 
	<p>Other than what we may 
	share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the 
	personal information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent 
	of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the 
	use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We 
	encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other 
	services you use. </p> 
	<p><strong>With our Service Providers</strong></p> 
	<p>Disclosure of your Personal 
	Information and Non-Identifying Information may also occur where we 
	engage or employ service providers, vendors or other third party entities 
	to facilitate provision of our Services (each a "<strong>Service Provider</strong>") 
	(e.g., without limitation, improvement of our Services’ features, 
	user account authentication, promotion and marketing, administration, 
	analytics, virtual currency transactions, crowd-sourcing, cloud storage 
	and other related services), to provide the Services on our behalf, 
	or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service 
	Providers may have access to your Personal Information only to perform 
	these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it 
	for any other purpose. </p> 
	<p><strong>Under Special Circumstances</strong></p> 
	<p>At times, we may disclose 
	information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties 
	as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond 
	to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), 
	to protect the property and rights of ngmoco or a third party, to protect 
	the safety of the public or any person or to prevent or stop activity 
	we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical 
	or legally actionable activity.</p> 
	<p>Under another special 
	set of circumstances, for example, in connection with a merger, acquisition, 
	reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we 
	may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of ngmoco assets, 
	including your Personal Information. </p> 
	<p><strong>Our Policy Toward 
	Children</strong></p> 
	<p>Our Services are not 
	intended for children under the age of 14 ("children") and we do 
	not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children. If we 
	discover that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from 
	children, we will take all reasonable measures to erase such information 
	from our systems and records as soon as possible.  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>Use as a Non-Registered 
	User</strong></p> 
	<p>In certain ngmoco Applications, 
	an ngmoco User may participate as a non-registered ngmoco User through 
	optional registration. This allows an ngmoco User to play the game in 
	a limited capacity. Ngmoco does not collect any Personal Information 
	or Non-Identifying information, other than Device ID, for non-registered 
	users. ngmoco cannot and does not ensure the preservation of game data 
	that is associated with any non-registered account.  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>Location-Based Services</strong></p> 
	<p>For location-based Services, 
	we may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the 
	real-time geographic location of your computer or mobile device. Unless 
	you explicitly opt-in to permit the use and sharing of your Personal 
	Information regarding your geographic location, your location data will 
	only be collected and used anonymously in a form that does not personally 
	identify you. When you opt in to Third Party Mobile Application providers’ 
	location services, we will share your geographic location with such 
	Third Party Mobile Application providers in connection with their location 
	services.  Please note that some location-based services may require 
	your Personal Information for the feature to work as intended.  
	</p> 
	<p><strong>Invite-A-Friend</strong></p> 
	<p>If you choose to use 
	our referral services to tell a friend about our Services, we will ask 
	you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically 
	send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to use an aspect 
	of our Services. ngmoco hashes these email addresses after using them 
	for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  
	</p> 
	<p> <strong>Find-A-Friend</strong></p> 
	<p>After an ngmoco User 
	logs into his or her account, the ngmoco User can access the find our 
	find-a-friend feature. We present ngmoco Users with options to search 
	for a friend or group of friends. Options include, but are not limited 
	to, searching one of our Networks, scanning the ngmoco User’s mobile 
	device, and scanning the ngmoco User’s Facebook, Google or Yahoo! 
	contacts. The ngmoco User may either add an existing ngmoco User, or 
	invite a friend to join the Service through the third-party service. 
	To facilitate, ngmoco will provide interfaces to authenticate to such 
	third-party service. We do not store the ngmoco User’s login credentials. 
	The ngmoco User who uses this feature is bound by the terms of the third-party 
	service.    </p> 
	<p><strong>Emailing Via a ngmoco 
	Application</strong></p> 
	<p>ngmoco Users may send 
	pre-formatted messages through use of their personal email account connected 
	to their mobile device to, for example, challenge their friends to beat 
	their high score in an ngmoco Application where this functionality is 
	available. ngmoco may store the email address of the friend that you 
	choose to email via our Services, but would only do so for social purposes 
	such as generating friend recommendations (e.g., in connection with 
	"people you may know" functionality). The message you initiate will 
	be sent through your personal email account to the email addresses you 
	choose. </p> 
	<p><strong>How We Protect Your 
	Personal Information</strong></p> 
	<p>ngmoco takes your privacy 
	very seriously and employs administrative, physical and electronic measures 
	to safeguard your information from identity theft and unauthorized access. 
	We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, 
	your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in 
	a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e.g. via e-mail, telephone, 
	mobile device). </p> 
	<p>We will make any legally 
	required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, 
	or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" 
	(as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) 
	to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Sites in the most expedient 
	time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent 
	with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures 
	necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable 
	integrity of the data system. </p> 
	<p><strong>Changing or Removing 
	Information</strong></p> 
	<p>As a user of an account, 
	you may update or delete the Personal Information in your profile by 
	logging into your account. You may also email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ngmoco.com" target="_blank">privacy@ngmoco.com</a> 
	to request that we delete your Personal Information from our database. 
	We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We 
	may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for 
	legitimate business purposes. Specific Shared Data cannot be retrieved 
	from Preferred Partners after its disclosure. </p> 
	<p>Where you share information 
	with other users through the communication channels of our Services, 
	you generally should not expect to have any ability to modify or remove 
	such communications.  Nor should you expect us to modify or delete 
	your comments upon your request. </p> 
	<p>If you participate in 
	a Promotion hosted by us (where you may or may not disclose the information 
	requested), you have the option to opt out at any time from such participation 
	and the receipt of any related communications. Please follow the unsubscribe 
	instructions provided in the relevant communications.  
	</p> 
	<p>If your friend received 
	an invitation from ngmoco per your referral to try the Services, your 
	friend may request that the name and email address used in the invitation
