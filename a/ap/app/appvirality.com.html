		<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites’ or service providers’ systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.

We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

These third parties may have access to your registration data or customer data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

		<p>We will obtain assurances from our third party partners that <strong> they will safeguard personal information </strong> consistent with the policies set forth in this Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by third party partners include a contract obligating the third party partner to provide at least the same level of protection for the personal information it has access to as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. <strong> If we become aware that a third party partner is using or disclosing personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure </strong>.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Google</strong></p>
		<p>Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s <strong><a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">Advertising Principles</a></strong>. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website</strong></p>
		<p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>We have implemented the following:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Remarketing with Google AdSense</strong></p>
		<p>We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong></p>
		<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will only disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of AppVirality, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. We respect the ownership rights of AppVirality Customers in Customer Data and, accordingly, AppVirality will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to inform you of any request made to us for disclosure of your Customer Data and to cooperate with you in taking those measures permitted by law for limiting disclosure of your Customer Data.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>
		<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong><a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf"> See more</a></strong></p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
		<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
		<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our homepage or at a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
		<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
		<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes.</p>
		<p>On our Privacy Policy Page you can change your personal information by emailing us.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
		<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
		<p>It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
		<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.</p>

		<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
		<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
		<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
		<p>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</p>
		<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
		<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>
		<p>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>
		<p>We will only use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>
		<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, complete, and current.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
		<p>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</p>
		<p>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</p>
		<p>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</p>
		<p>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</p>
		<p>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</p>
		<p>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Enforcement and Liability</strong></p>
		<p>AppVirality will conduct compliance audits of its privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy. AppVirality employees that are found to have violated this Privacy Policy will be subjected to disciplinary action up to and including termination of their employment with AppVirality.</p>
