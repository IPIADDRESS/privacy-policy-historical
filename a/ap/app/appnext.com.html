            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                This privacy policy ("<b>Privacy Policy</b>") explains how AppNext collects, use and share your information, in order to provide its advertising and mobile distribution and promotion services to its partners and clients ("<b>Partners</b>").
            </p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that we collect when you visit our website, located at
                <a href="www.appnext.com">www.Appnext.com</a>. To learn what information we collect when you visit our website, please visit the [<a href="www.appnext.com">link</a>].
            </p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                AppNext collects your information through our software development kit ("<b>SDK</b>"), APIs and similar technological solutions (together, the "<b>SDK</b>"), which is integrated in third party mobile applications ("<b>Publishers</b>"), in order to allow the tracking of mobile application use, installations and downloads, and to enable the serving of advertising and personalized content. In order to do this, our Publishers have to actively set parameters that allow for such integration and measurement. In such instances, information collected and processed may be provided to both the Publisher and other Partners.
            </p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                We collect information under the direction of our Publishers, and have no direct relationship with the individuals ("<b>End Users</b>") whose information we process. We respect the right to privacy of Publishers and End Users. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us, so please read this Privacy Policy carefully to learn about your choices.
            </p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                <b>Please note that we are acting as a third party processor on behalf of our Publishers. For further queries, please review the privacy policy of our Publisher associated with the application in question.</b>
            </p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in our Terms and Conditions, which is available at [<a href="/terms-conditions/">link</a>].
            </p>
            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">What information we collect</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">We collect the following categories of information for the purposes listed below:</p>
            <div class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph"><b>Device and app information</b> – this category includes your
                        device's type and model, system language, the device's operating system (such as Android or iOS),
                        SDK version, mobile carrier name, mobile browsers installed on the device (such as Chrome or
                        Safari), app history and usage information (such as information about running and installed apps on
                        the device), information regarding downloads and installations of mobile applications and any
                        information regarding in-app events (such as in-app purchases), your device's IP address, and
                        identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android
                        Advertising ID, or other types of unique device identifiers (a number uniquely allocated to your
                        device by your device manufacturer).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">
                        <b>Ad information</b> – this category includes information about the online ads and personalized content we have served (or attempted to serve) to you. It includes things like how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on, whether you viewed, clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad, ad engagement history and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website, downloaded an app or purchased the product or service advertised.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph"><b>Location information</b> – AppNext collects information about your general location (such as city and country). For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location. This information does not tell us where your device is precisely located. This information is sent as a normal part of internet traffic. In addition, we also collect implicit location information, which allows us to infer that you are either interested in a place or that you might be at the place – this information does not actually tell us where your device is precisely located.</p>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">In addition, AppNext may collect the precise location of your device (using GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth signals, Beacons signals and cell tower ids that can be used to derive or estimate precise location, or other geo-location data), when location services have been enabled by the end user for the mobile app or website that uses our SDK (you typically have to choose to turn on device-based location services).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph"><b>Log information</b> – this category includes the app or website visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular), and cookie information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="privacy__main-paragraph"><b>Information from advertising partners ("Advertisers") and other third parties</b> – this category includes information we receive from our Publishers, Advertisers and other Partners that we work with to help us deliver ads and personalized content to you and recognize you across browsers and devices. This may include pseudonymous advertiser identifiers that some Advertisers or other third party ad platforms choose to share with us. This information is also used to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </div>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">	Along with our Partners, we may use tracking technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage such as HTML5. Our Partners may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash. Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 and Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash are used to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS’s.

                        <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">	Our Publisher may use cookies to track your behavior on their apps or websites. A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a browser. The browser provides this piece of text to the originating server when the visitor returns.

            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">To serve personalized content and ads we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies.

AppNext requires its Partners to honor opt-out preferences expressed using these controls. However, please note that opting-out using these settings would only prevents serving tailored ads to you; <b>this would not affect other activities</b>, such as serving contextual advertising, ad frequency capping and analytics.</p>

            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph"><b>Do Not Track Disclosure </b></p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow users another method of informing websites and services that they do not want certain information about their website visits collected over time and across websites. Because the effect of DNT signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a DNT signal from your browser. Rather, we provide or respect the consumer choice options set forth in this privacy policy.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">Information Retention and Access to Information</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">We may retain personally identifiable information we process on behalf of our Partners for as long as needed to provide services to them. We may adopt shorter retention periods if so directed by our Partners. We may retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">Please note we have no direct relationship with the End Users. An End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information should direct his query to the relevant Publisher. If an End User requests us to remove any personally identifiable information relating to him or her, we will respond to their request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">Security</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">AppNext has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to information will not occur; we make good faith efforts to prevent such occurrences. We do not warrant or represent that your account or any of your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">International transfers</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">AppNext may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country where we originally collected it for the purposes of storage and processing of information and operating our services. Those countries may not have the same information protection laws as your country. However, when we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that international transfers comply with applicable laws. For example, if we transfer your information from the European Economic Area to a country outside it, such as the United States, we will seek to take additional steps such as entering into EU compliant data transfer agreements with the data importer where necessary.</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">Children Information</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">AppNext does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information (including persistent device identifiers) relating to children under the age of 13. In addition, we require our Publishers to certify to us that their services (such as their mobile apps) are not primarily directed to appeal to children under the age of 13, and to avoid sharing with us any personally identifiable information relating to children under the age of 13.</p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">Please note that while we strive hard to ensure that our policies are respected, we cannot be held responsible for the practices of our Publishers. Our publishers are responsible to ensure that their privacy practices comply with applicable privacy laws and requirements, including with respect to safeguarding children's privacy (such as by complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998).</p>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">If you have knowledge of any incident in which we may be collecting personally identifiable information relating to children under the age of 13, or that our SDK is included in any service (such as a mobile app) that is directed to or aimed to appeal to audience under the age of 13, please let us know immediately by contacting us at: [<a href="mailto:support@appnext.com">support@appnext.com</a>], and we will remove their personally identifiable information from our servers without delay. </p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">Changes to Our Privacy Practices</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our privacy practices, from time to time. If we make any material changes we will post such amendment on our website, prior to the change becoming effective; material changes will become effective seven (7) days as of the date we posted the notice on our website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices (the last change will be reflected in the "last updated" date above).</p>

            <h2 class="privacy__main-header">Have Any Questions or Comments?</h2>
            <p class="privacy__main-paragraph">If you have any questions, concerns or feedback about our privacy policy, please don't hesitate to contact us at [<a href="mailto:support@appnext.com">support@appnext.com</a>]. We will make our best efforts to respond to you in a timely manner.</p>
