				You can visit www.apple.com without telling us who you are or
				revealing any personal information about yourself. <br>
				<br>
				While IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) are logged
				to track a user's session, the user remains anonymous. Tracking
				IP addresses gives us an idea of which parts of our site users
				are visiting and how long they spend there. We do not link IP
				addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that
				a user's session is tracked, but the user is anonymous. The user's
				browser also lets us know the type of computer and operating system
				being used.<br>
				<br>
				If, however, you want to purchase a product from the Apple Store,
				register a new product, sign up for a mailing list, enter a sweepstakes
				or sign onto a page that requires authorization, you'll be asked
				to provide us your name, e-mail address, postal address, and possibly
				other personal information. <br>
				<br>
				Some Apple web pages utilize "cookies," which are small files
				with your personal information placed on your hard disk for record-keeping
				purposes. A cookie helps Apple remember who you are, and what
				questions you've already answered. It makes your subsequent visits
				to the web page simpler and more seamless for you. You can set
				your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you
				the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web
				pages which require authorization, cookies are not optional. Users
				choosing not to accept cookies will likely not be able to access
				those pages.)<br>
				<br>
				When Apple receives information about your session or about you,
				we may use it for research or to improve our site and the services
				we offer you. <br>
				<br>
				We ask you if you want us to use that information to continue
				contact with you via e-mail or postal mail -- for example, to
				send you information or special offers.  We also ask you if you
				want us to share your personal information with other companies
				that offer related services. If you do not want us or other companies
				to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Apple will respect
				your wishes. <br>
