    	<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

		<img src="images/red-separator.png" id="red-separator">


		<p>The Associated Press and its affiliates (collectively, “AP”) recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information that may be provided to us by individual users or viewers of AP content online. Accordingly, we have adopted a privacy policy to govern how we treat such information. AP may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, and any such changes will become effective when the AP posts the revised privacy policy online. Your continued use of this Web site indicates your consent to AP's privacy policy and the most current version then in effect.
		</p><p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong>
		</p><p>AP may collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, such as when you provide your personal information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number or address or when you submit credit card information for payment of services. AP may also collect individual user information that you provide to us offline and AP will treat such information in the same manner as if it was collected off of this Web site.
		</p><p>AP, or third parties on our behalf, may also collect non-personally identifiable information via the use of cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that are transferred to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to assist you in using site information and content by saving your user preferences. Cookies are also used to collect aggregate information about Web site users on an anonymous basis.
		</p><p><strong>What Does The Associated Press Do With The Information That It Collects?</strong>
		</p><p>AP will use the personally identifiable information directly submitted by you solely for the purpose for which you have provided it, whether it be to subscribe to a service, request information, order a reprint of an article or photograph, etc. We will only use and disclose the credit card information submitted by you as necessary to process your payment transaction. We may also use the information you provide to us to contact you for reasons related to your original communication to us. Additionally, we may periodically send you promotional e-mail about existing or prospective products and services offered by The Associated Press, as well as to obtain information to better understand our users. We may also use information you provide to better serve you, and, if you have given your consent for us to do so, to send you e-mails concerning offers from our partners and other third parties that we think may be of interest to you. We may disclose the information we collect about you to our affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing services; provided, however, that we will not disclose any credit card numbers which may be provided by you except for the purpose of payment for services.
		</p><p>With regard to non-personally identifiable information, AP is currently using and has contracted with third party vendors to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our content in order to improve our services. We may also perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in our online products and services for product development purposes.
		</p><p>AP will not disclose any personally identifiable information about our current or former users to anyone, except as permitted or required by law, or as described herein. AP will endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online.
		</p><p><strong>With Whom Does The Associated Press Share The Information That It Collects?</strong>
		</p><p>As a general rule, AP will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except under one of the following circumstances: we have your permission; we determine in good faith that it is legally required to be revealed by any relevant statute, regulation, ordinance, rule, administrative or court order, decree, or subpoena; information revealed during the course of AP's enforcement of the policies and procedures of this Web site; information that we determine must be disclosed to correct what we believe to be false or misleading information or to address activities that we believe to be manipulative, deceptive or otherwise a violation of law; where you are otherwise notified at the time we collect the data; where we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; when disclosed to an affiliate of AP or when such disclosure is made subject to confidentiality restrictions in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Web sites to which the AP privacy policy applies. AP may share the non-personally identifiable information that AP gathers, in aggregate form only, with advertisers and other partners.
		</p><p><strong>Children's Policy</strong>
		</p><p>AP does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database.
		</p><p><strong>International Usage</strong>
		</p><p>If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using this Web site, you consent to this transfer.
		</p><p><strong>How Does A User Change Or Update Its Information?</strong>
&gt; 		</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns about the AP privacy policy or would like the personally identifiable information that you have provided to The Associated Press removed from our files, please contact AP at <a href="mailto:apmobile@ap.org">apmobile@ap.org</a>
