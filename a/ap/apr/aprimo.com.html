        </p><p class="boldBlue">Information Collection and Use
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Information Collection</span><br>
          Aprimo is the sole owner of the information collected on <a href="http://www.aprimo.com">www.aprimo.com</a> by Aprimo. We may collect information from you at several different points on our Web site.
        
        </p><p>Aprimo is also a data processor for certain of its customers under the EU Safe Harbor and maintains the data collected and stored on behalf of clients.
        
        </p><p>We treat all our client information with complete confidentiality (regardless of whether we collect it or our customer collects it and asks us to store and maintain such information).
        
        </p><p>In certain portions of this Web site, you must complete a registration form in order to receive information about our products and services or to participate in a webinar or other event. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, company, telephone number and e-mail address). We will use this information to contact you about the products, services and events featured on our site for which you have expressed interest. Other demographic information we may request (such as information about your business) and unique identifiers may be required so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site or so we can provide you with the most appropriate information. We do not require that you submit a social security number or credit card information in connection with the use of this Web site. If you are prompted to disclose such information, please do not disclose it and contact <a href="mailto:security@aprimo.com">security@aprimo.com</a>.
        
        </p><p class="boldBlue">Information Use
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Profile</span><br>
          We store information that we collect through web forms, cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information we keep on individual users that details their potential interest in our products and services. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide relevant information and improve the content of our Web site. This profile is used to direct pertinent marketing promotions to the user. At the present time, we do not share your profile with third parties.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Cookies</span><br>
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Here is a link to information about cookies: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a>
        
        </p><p>We use cookies to facilitate the filling out of our various web forms. After you fill out a form, a cookie is set saving your information (name, title, company, address, phone and e-mail) which then pre-populates (i.e. fills out) the pertinent sections of other forms you may be prompted to complete on our Web site. We also use cookies for the password-protected sections of our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a username and password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. See the "Profile" section.
        
        </p><p>In addition, we utilize certain software to analyze the server logs and generate a report about the traffic to <a href="http://www.aprimo.com">www.aprimo.com</a>. These reports are general and we do not utilize a cookie or other means to monitor a user's specific activity or return visits to our site. However, this analysis does provide us with information about the source through which you are originating your connection to the Internet (such as an Internet service provider such as AOL or MSN or your company if you are accessing the Internet through corporate access).
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Log Files</span><br>
          Like most standard Web site servers we use log files on our Web site. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.
        
        </p><p>In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see the Opt-out section.
        
        </p><p class="boldBlue">Communications from Aprimo
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Special Offers and Updates</span><br>
          We may send you a welcoming e-mail to confirm registration after your initial registration or following a subsequent interaction we have with you through this site or an e-mail. You will occasionally receive information relating to our products, services, special deals, and/or a newsletter. Out of respect for your privacy we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Updates and Newsletter</span><br>
          If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. We provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Service Announcements</span><br>
          On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send you an e-mail. Generally, you will not be able to opt-out of these communications, though you can deactivate your account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Customer Service</span><br>
          We communicate with our customers on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. We will reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with our customer's wishes.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Disclosure of Personal Information</span><br>
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
        
        </p><p>At the present time, we DO NOT otherwise share personal information with other companies, except as is necessary in connection with our efforts to communicate with you.
        
        </p><p><span class="boldBlue">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
          You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so that if you request information from us and would like the information delivered in a non-electronic format, you can keep your e-mail address off our lists.
        
        </p><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications you may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the "Opt-Out" link in the e-mail or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@aprimo.com">info@aprimo.com</a>. In addition, you may contact us as follows in order to opt-out:
