<p><b>What information does AWW collect?</b></p>

<p><b>What do we do with the information we collect? </b></p>

<p>1. It is used to fulfill and maintain your profile registration.</p>

<p>2. Your phone number may be used in the event that our customer service representatives need to contact you and cannot reach you by email. </p>

<p>3. The e-mail address members supply us with is never sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you e-mail about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that AWW personally endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, Holiday cards, and the latest happenings on AWW. If you would like not to be notified by e-mail or would like to change your e-mail address, please send us a note with the <a href="/contact.html">customer service form</a> and let us know how we can best serve you.</p>

<p><b>With whom do we share your information and for what purpose? </b></p>

<p>AWW does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with others. However, when one or more of our business partners co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest, we may share some or all of the information collected in connection with such service, promotion or contest with the co-sponsor(s). If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest. </p>

<p><b>What information do parties other than AWW collect? </b></p>

<p>Some advertisers or entities that have links on our site (including as part of the AWW directory) may collect personally identifiable information about you when you access or utilize those links. AWW does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><b>What are cookies and how do we use them?</b></p>

<p>Our site may use cookies to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored content. We also use cookies to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are popular and which are not. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate information to our sponsors and advertisers.   Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own cookies. </p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. You will not be able to log in to AWW if you turn off the cookies option.</p>

We reserve the right to release information about members who we believe are in violation of applicable laws or regulations. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful.</p>

<p><b>Changes to our Privacy Policy </b></p>
