<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
<br>
Adultspace takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit our site and/or become a member. Please read this notice carefully.<br>
Adultspace (“we” and “our”) is an online adult-oriented community where you can learn about and communicate with others. As a user, you can create a public personal profile, which can include pictures and other information about yourself. The purpose of profiles is to provide an easy way for our members to identify people they might be interested in meeting. To facilitate this social purpose of our service, the information you include in your profile is freely displayed to the public. Users can also search profiles, and communicate and send messages to each other through Adultspace.<br>
<br>
<h2>How We Collect And Use Information</h2>
<h3>Your Email Address. </h3>
When you join Adultspace, you are required to supply us with your email address. This is the only piece of user-specific information that we gather from you. We collect this information to authenticate users, to market our services (including those of our other sites, but not third party sites), and to send notifications to users relating to our services or your account. <br>
Except as otherwise provided in this policy statement or as required by law, we will keep your email address strictly confidential—we will never provide, share, rent, trade or sell user-specific personal information such as your email address to any third party marketers, unless you ask us to. <br>
Profile Information <br>
When joining Adultspace.com, you are asked and in some cases required to provide certain information for display in your public personal profile, such as a username, a description of yourself and your interests, profession, educational level, body type, eye color, height, martial status, age, location, whether you smoke or drink, and your sexual activities and interests. <br>
User’s should be aware that any information in their profile is public and is freely displayed, and accessible to anyone. In addition, when other users of the site perform searches, they may locate your user profile because of the information you include there. Members may find and contact you based on the information you put in your profile.<br>
If you wish to remain anonymous, don’t include profile information that would allow anyone to personally identify you. For example, don’t put your real name or street address in your description of yourself, and don’t adopt a username that is similar to your real name. Also be aware that any photograph you supply will be publicly displayed, and people may recognize you. <br>
We may also use your profile data to improve our site and/or tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in our site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.<br>
Members can change their profile information at any time.<br>
<br>
<h3>Information Logged By Adultspace </h3>
In addition to the information-gathering described above, we also log certain non-personally-identifiable information, including the IP address assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider, aggregate user data, and browser type, as you visit our site or use our service. This data is used to help manage our website and provide a better user experience, to track usage, to focus advertising and in the case of IP addresses, for security and monitoring purposes. Except as expressly described in this privacy policy statement, we will not share this information with any third parties such as marketers; although non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members.<br>
Information You Provide When Using Your Credit Card<br>
Users must make a payment in order to become full paid members of Adultspace. Members make such payments using a credit card or check payment. Because we use the services of an outside vendor to collect these payments, we never receive information such as your credit card or bank account number, or any other information you furnish when setting up payments. Our outside vendor for payment has its own privacy policy, which may be viewed at its website http://about.ccbill.com/html_forms/privacy_policy-english.html (the website at which you make your payment). We will not use any outside vendor for payment or any other service unless they maintain a stringent privacy policy and represent that they will never give out personally-identifiable information about you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Use of Cookies </h3>
<br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Like most sites, we use cookies to store user and visitor data and to record session information, for enhancement of the user experience, and to focus advertising. Users may be able to configure their browser to accept or reject cookies, or notify the user when a cookie is set. It is the user's responsibility to set browser preferences regarding cookies, although you should be aware that disabling cookies will affect performance and functionality of our site<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Links</strong>. You may encounter links to other sites on Adultspace. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When linking to another site, you should read the privacy policy appearing on that site. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies By Advertisers</strong>. Our advertisers may set cookies to allow an ad server to recognize your computer each time the advertiser sends you an online advertisement. In this way, advertisers may gather information about where you accessed their advertisements and determine which ads you clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver focused advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Adultspace and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong>. Your user account is protected by the user ID and password you created. We take reasonable and proper precautions to make sure that this information is kept secret. For example, we provide access to your user information only to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our technical staff. <br>
<br>
<strong>Choice/Opt-Out.</strong> If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.<br>
<br>
<strong>Successors</strong>. <br>
We reserve the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale or acquisition of our company. <br>
<br>
<strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</strong>. <br>
We may occasionally make changes to this privacy policy. If so, we will post all changes on our site so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and how and when we may disclose it. You are bound by any minor changes to the policy when you use the site after those changes have been posted. If we make a significant change, however, we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.<br>
<br>
<strong>Contacting the Web Site</strong>. We take our users privacy extremely seriously, and we have adopted policies and practices that will prevent the sharing of private information you provide. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adultspace.com">privacy@adultspace.com</a>
