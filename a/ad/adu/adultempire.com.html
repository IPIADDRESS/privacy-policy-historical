<b>1. Personal information collected</b>
<p>
We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the DVD Empire Websites.  This information includes your email address and a password when you register to create your dvdempire.com account.  While you can browse our online store and make purchases without registering, you will need to register in order to take advantage of certain features.  We may also ask for personal information when you contact our Help Desk. This will allow us to protect your confidentiality by verifying your identity.
</p><p>
Purchase information
</p><p>
When you make a purchase using a credit card, we collect your name, your billing address for the card, the card type, number, and expiration date.  We collect this information in order to bill you for your purchase.  We also collect information that allows us to ship and keep you informed of the status of your order.  This includes your email address and the name, address, and telephone number of the intended recipient(s).  Billing information may be provided over the phone by calling adultdvdempire.com at 1-724-933-0399.
</p><p>
If you are a registered user of adultdvdempire.com, you can choose to save your billing information for one or more credit cards in "Your Account."  You may change this saved information anytime.  Simply go to Your Account.  Log in with your username and password, then click "Contact Information" and edit whatever personal information you wish.
</p><p>
Cookies and other computer information
</p><p>
When you visit DVD Empire Websites, you will be assigned a permanent "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive.  The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our sites so we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience.
</p><p>
You can choose to shop on DVD Empire Websites without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of our site.  These features include remembering your password (so you don't have to log in each time you visit), storing your shopping cart for later use and, in the future, providing a more personalized shopping experience. To shop without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)
</p><p>
We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to DVD Empire Websites.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring Website, if any.  We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to our site and will not sell or rent this information to any third parties.
</p><p>
Contacting DVD Empire
</p><p>
We will use your email address to respond to your questions, suggestions, and/or requests for assistance in using our site.
</p><p>
Other times we may collect personal information
</p><p>
From time to time, DVD Empire may conduct surveys and contests via our Websites, email, or other media.  If you choose to participate, we may request your name, email address, mailing address and other personal information.  We will never sell or rent such information to any third parties. 
</p><p>
<b>2. Use of your personal information </b>
</p><p>
Information we collect on DVD Empire Websites may be used to enhance your shopping experience in the following ways: 
</p><p>
Deliver merchandise that you purchase online 
Register you as a member of DVD Empire 
Bill your credit card for your purchases 
Confirm your shopping orders 
Respond to your customer service inquiries or requests 
Communicate special bi-monthly DVD release lists, promotions and featured items to you, if you choose to receive such notices 
Find and stock the products you want  
Customize your shopping experience 
</p><p>
<b>3. When and with whom we share your personal information </b>
</p><p>
We never sell or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.  We will share personal customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Websites; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions.
</p><p>
Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law.  We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners.  This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
</p><p>
<b>4. How you can control the use of your personal information </b>
</p><p>
Registering as an adultdvdempire.com customer helps us provide a better shopping experience for you and allows you to make purchases more conveniently, without having to re-enter your payment and shipping information each time you make a purchase on our site.  Although you must register as a dvdempire.com customer in order to purchase DVD Empire products, it is not necessary to register to visit our site.
</p><p>
As a registered user, you can modify your personal information anytime.  Simply go to Your Account.  Log in with your username and password, then click "Contact Information" and edit whatever information you wish.  To have your personal information deleted, contact adultdvdempire.com by telephone at 1-724-933-0395.
</p><p>
Do not share your adultdvdempire.com password with anyone.  Other than on our Websites, DVD Empire will never ask you for your password.
</p><p>
<b>5. How you can decide what marketing communication you receive from us </b>
</p><p>
If you choose to receive them, adultdvdempire.com may periodically send you email messages describing new items, featured merchandise and special promotions. You can choose to stop receiving this email at any time.  Simply go to Your Account, log in, click "Email Address &amp; Password" and remove the check in the box next to the words "Please send me email with adultdvdempire.com DVD release lists." 
</p><p>
The only email messages you will receive from adultdvdempire.com when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Help Desk inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site.  We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.
</p><p>
<b>6. How we protect the security of your personal information </b>
</p><p>
The security of your personal information is very important to us.  In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.
</p><p>
DVD Empire has also obtained a digital certificate from Verisign, Inc., a leading provider of Internet trust services.  When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.  If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear.  This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an adultdvdempire.com Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server.
</p><p>
Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered for an account at adultdvdempire.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password).  Please keep this password confidential.  The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect.  You may change it anytime by going to Your Account.  Log in with your username and password, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.
</p><p>
<b>7. Changes to the DVD Empire Privacy Policy </b>
</p><p>
We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this privacy policy at any time.  If we make any significant change to this policy, we will post a notice of the change on adultdvdempire.com.
</p><p>
<b>8. How to contact DVD Empire</b>
</p><p>
If you have comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at info@dvdempire.com. We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.
