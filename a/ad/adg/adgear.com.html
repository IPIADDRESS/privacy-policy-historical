                <h2>Advertising and Content Served through BLOOM Digital Platforms' AdGear Technology</h2>
                <p>
                  BLOOM Digital Platforms firmly believes in the importance of online privacy for its advertisers, publishers and users. BLOOM Digital Platforms, through its AdGear technology, does not collect any personally-identifying information before, during or after the delivery of its clients' advertisements; our delivery technology may collect non-personally identifying general information related to campaign results, such as total number of delivered impressions (ads), click-throughs, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AdGear technology may employ cookies to collect non-personally identifying information in the course of providing clients with ad-serving services and for the purpose of helping clients determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to a user. A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a user's computer when that computer's browser views an advertisement or website of one of BLOOM Digital Platforms' clients. The cookie is associated with and unique to the specific computer. The cookie does not contain the user's name, address, phone number, email address, or anything that personally identifies it. BLOOM Digital Platforms collects into the cookie only non-personally identifying information such as the type of the computer's operating system, type of internet browser software, what web pages were viewed and at what time, geographic location of user's internet service provider, anonymous demographic information collected through anonymous online surveys such as gender and age block.
                </p>
                <h2>The Opt-Out Cookie </h2>
                <p>
                   BLOOM Digital Platforms allows consumers to opt out of the AdGear ad-serving cookie so that no unique information or number is associated with their computer's browser. Blocking and/or opting out of cookies does not stop advertisements from being served to a computer; rather, it prevents data from being associated with that computer's browser. Please note if a user chooses an opt-out cookie, AdGear is unable to recognize that user's browser from one visit to the next and the same ad may be sent to that browser multiple times.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Click here if you wish to implement the:
                  <a href="http://d.adgear.com/optout">ad-serving cookie opt-out</a> |
                  <a href="http://d.adgear.com/optin">ad-serving cookie opt-in</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                   Note that all other cookies associated with your browser will remain intact and your opt-out will be effective for the entire life of your browser on your hard drive or until you delete the cookie file from your hard drive. This opt-out process will erase the cookie ID but not the cookie. It is necessary to store this "Keep Out" cookie on your computer in order that you be recognized as an opt-out user.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you previously opted out and would like to reverse your setting, click on the previously mentioned URL to opt back in.
                </p>
                <h2>Third Party Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                On occasion, an advertiser may request that BLOOM Digital Platforms provides or assists in the data collection of information supplied voluntarily by consumers within the body of AdGear delivered ads, which may include personal information fields completed by the user. BLOOM Digital Platforms does so only on behalf of that advertiser. This information is understood by BLOOM Digital Platforms to be used solely by that advertiser for the purposes identified within the advertisement to provide the user with requested goods, services or information as established within that advertiser's privacy policy. BLOOM Digital Platforms is not responsible for the advertiser's use of this voluntarily supplied data. BLOOM Digital Platforms does not distribute this information to any party other than as indicated in the advertisement. BLOOM Digital Platforms never associates any of this information with any data gathered or used in the delivery of that advertisement. This information is provided directly to the advertiser, and is not collected or kept by either BLOOM Digital Platforms or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>Changes to This Document</h2>
                <p>
                BLOOM Digital Platforms reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time and without notice. We will make every effort to post any changes to this policy in this area so that you are aware of the information we collect, how it is used, and under what circumstances is disclosed.
