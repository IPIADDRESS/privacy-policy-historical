<p>To make use of certain features on our websites, subscribers must provide certain information as part of the registration process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, and age, and we might request information on your profession/ occupation, interests, and the like.) The information you supply will help us to make ADGULLY Site a better website by allowing us to tailor our site to your interests and make it more useful to you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. Moreover, the information supplied by you is subject to verification as in many cases where the subscriber has enlisted as a Freelancer, the content delivered by him to the client has to be within the legal framework of the internet subject to the Indian Laws. In some instances, which involve, for example, subscriptions, you may need to provide all the information before the subscription can reach you if we don't know how to contact you. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you are still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without providing any personal information.</p>
<p>To help make our websites more responsive to the needs of our subscribers, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie". We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable the Site to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to the ADGULLY Site. We use cookies to help us tailor our sites to meet your needs, and to deliver a better service that is keyed to the interests of our subscribers. We use cookies to determine what features our subscribers prefer and which are less popular. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple process to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information on this process.</p>
