        <h1>AdStation Affiliate Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>THE ADKNOWLEDGE PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE
CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES.</p>

<h2>Effective as of March 16, 2006</h2>
<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes Adknowledge, Inc.'s
("Adknowledge") provision of a technology and advertising platform for
marketers and content publishers such as web sites or email newsletters
and operators (together, referred to as "Publishers" or "Publisher
Properties") to attempt to deliver more relevant advertisements to
consumers. Adknowledge does not collect, obtain or maintain personally
identifiable information ("PII") from Publishers who use our
CustomAd© technology product. The data collected and maintained by
Adknowledge from Publishers using CustomAd© technology ("Anonymous
Information") is not sufficient to permit someone to identify a
particular consumer by name, email address, mailing address, telephone
number or through social security number, driver's license or other
government issued ID. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
Publishers or other companies that Adknowledge does not own or control
or to people that Adknowledge does not employ or manage. Adknowledge
retains its rights to enter into new or different lines of business with
consumers and if and to the extent it does so, it may display a
different Privacy Policy to the consumer for such lines of business.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Adknowledge Collection of Information.</b>
    <ol>
        <li><u>User Information</u>.
        Adknowledge does not track or maintain PII about consumers. It
        maintains Anonymous Information including behavior data (i.e.,
        visiting a particular website or clicking on a particular ad)
        and demographic or similar data (i.e., browser type or lifestyle
        data). Adknowledge may maintain PII information if it is in an
        encrypted format which cannot be decrypted; that is, the data as
        stored is Anonymous Information rather than PII. For example, a
        Publisher may encrypt the email address joe@smith.com into the
        term "123abc" with a one-way encryption routine and transfer the
        term "123abc" to Adknowledge to store on Adknowledge's
        computers, but it is not currently feasible for Adknowledge or
        others, due to the sophistication of the encryption routines
        utilized, to decode the term "123abc" back into the original
        email address, joe@smith.com.</li>
        <li><u>User Behaviors Collected with
        Cookies, Web beacons, and Other Information</u>. Adknowledge
        may use cookies, web beacons and IP addresses to associate your
        Anonymous Information (as described in Section 1.1 above) with
        an anonymous profile containing data such as your online
        behaviors, which could include records on viewing, opening or
        clicking on a particular online advertisement or visiting a
        website operated by a Publisher. Additionally, Adknowledge may
        use other new and evolving sources of information and
        information gathering in the future (together, "Technology
        Information") to assist Publishers in delivering more relevant
        advertisements to you.
        <ol>
            <li><u>Cookies</u>. A cookie is
            a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your
            computer that allows Adknowledge to identify your IP address
            with corresponding information in Adknowledge's database.
            Adknowledge may use cookies to track individual responses or
            views of advertisements when an advertisement has been
            viewed on Publisher Properties. You may read more about
            cookies at http://www.cookiecentral.com/.</li>
            <li><u>Web beacons</u>. A web
            beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web
            page and can assist Adknowledge in associating an
            individual's Anonymous Information to a unique profile in
            our database. Web beacons enable Adknowledge to track
            certain Web sites you visit or advertisements you view
            online at Publisher Properties. Web beacons help determine
            products or services in which you may be interested and help
            track online behaviors for marketing purposes. More
            information about web beacons is available at
            http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html.</li>
            <li><u>IP Addresses</u>.
            Adknowledge may use your IP address to better target an ad
            to you or people in your area. Unless you use a static IP
            address, an IP address relates to households or larger
            communities. For example, if you use a national Internet
            Service Provider (ISP) to access the Internet, such as
            America Online, it may not be possible to determine your
            geographic location based on your IP address. If you use a
            local ISP, it may be possible to narrow your community to a
            fewer number of people or businesses which your ISP
            services. Because an individual does not own a particular IP
            address, a consumer's IP address is not personally
            identifiable information and may change for any number of
            reasons over time, e.g., even if you rent a static IP
            address for a limited period.</li>
            <li><u>Where Technology Information
            is Collected</u>. Technology Information is collected
            directly from Adknowledge advertisements or indirectly
            through Publishers that Adknowledge contracts with to
            display advertisements. Such advertisements will usually be
            displayed within one of the following advertising vehicles:
            <ul>
                <li><u>Websites</u>.
                Adknowledge may set a cookie on your computer or
                associate behavior with your Internet service provider's
                IP address when you view advertisements delivered on
                Publisher websites. After a behavior is associated to a
                cookie or an IP address, Adknowledge may track how you
                interact with the advertisement and the Publisher
                website (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing,
                etc.).</li>
                <li><u>Email</u>.
                Adknowledge may track your interaction with emails sent
                to you on behalf of Publishers (for example, when you
                open or click on an email, register, purchase, or browse
                in response to such email), but does not maintain a list
                of email addresses or other PII in connection with this
                activity.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><u>Outside Information</u>.
        Adknowledge may lawfully receive information about you,
        including demographic data, purchasing trends and similar
        information, from third parties, such as information located in
        public databases ("Outside Information"). Outside Information
        shall be Anonymous Information.</li>

        <li><u>No Information Collected from
        Minors</u>. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY
        PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO
        ADKNOWLEDGE. If Adknowledge is notified it has any information
        about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be
        promptly deleted from our active database.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b> Use of Information and User Data.</b>

    <ol>
        <li><u>Discretion to Use Information</u>.
        Adknowledge may share Anonymous Information about your behaviors
        with trusted Publishers under confidentiality agreements. These
        Publishers may use this information to better target
        advertisements to you. If you wish to end your email
        subscription with a Publisher, you may follow the instructions
        at the end of each email message to unsubscribe or follow the
        instructions detailed at Section 4 below.</li>
        <li><u>Targeted Advertising Delivered
        by Publishers</u>. Adknowledge uses Anonymous Information to
        assist its Publishes in targeting advertisements more
        effectively. When a consumer is online, Adknowledge uses
        Technology Information to associate an individual with their
        Anonymous Information and Adknowledge assists its Publishers in
        attempting to show information and advertising for products and
        services to which the consumer may respond. Adknowledge may use
        data collected from a response to one type of advertising or
        information for targeting advertisements or other information
        through a different venue. For example, Adknowledge may inform
        an email Publisher that a consumer responded to a baseball
        banner advertisement and that Publisher may try to deliver to
        the consumer a baseball-related advertisement and other
        information to the consumer via email.</li>
        <li><u>Legal Process</u>.
        Adknowledge may disclose information in its possession and
        control to respond to subpoenas, court orders and other legal
        process as required by law.</li>

        <li><u>Summary Data</u>. Adknowledge
        may sell or transfer Anonymous Information, such as summary or
        aggregated non-PII about consumers or consumer sub-groups.</li>
        <li><u>Storage and Protection of
        Information</u>. Adknowledge stores Anonymous Information in
        a database on Adknowledge computers. These computers have
        security measures, such as a firewall, to protect against the
        loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under
        Adknowledge's control. Adknowledge also maintains physical and
        procedural safeguards to protect information. Furthermore,
        Adknowledge maintains the data in its database in encrypted
        form, so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is
        less likely to be in a format intelligible or useable for
        purposes not authorized or intended by Adknowledge.
        Notwithstanding such measures, Adknowledge cannot guarantee that
        its security or privacy protection measures will prevent its
        computers from being illegally accessed and the data on them
        stolen or altered.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b> Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</b>
    <ol>
        <li><u>Advertiser cookies and web
        beacons</u>. Publishers who place advertisements on the
        Internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other
        technology to collect information about you. Adknowledge does
        not control Publishers' use of such technology.</li>
        <li><u>Links</u>. The Publishers'
        Websites and email messages transmitted on behalf of Publishers
        may contain hypertext links to the Websites of third parties.
        Adknowledge is not responsible for the privacy practices or the
        content of such other Websites.</li>

        <li><u>Publishers</u>. To learn
        about how a particular Publisher may use your PII or Anonymous
        Information, you should read the privacy policy of that
        Publisher.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><b> How You May Exercise Your Privacy Rights
    And Unsubscribe.</b>

    <ol>
        <li><u>Websites</u>. To prevent the
        display of Publisher or Adknowledge advertising on a Website,
        for example, banner advertisements, do not visit the Website. To
        only prevent Adknowledge from tracking your behavior on a
        Website, turn off cookies, utilize a changing IP address, and do
        not click on or interact with any advertisements.</li>

        in the footer of any message you receive from the Publisher.</li>
