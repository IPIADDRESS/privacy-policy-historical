			  to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in 
			  connection with www.Ads2india.com (WebSite). This Privacy Policy 
			  may be updated by us at any time by posting on WebSite without any 
			  prior notice. Also, this Privacy Statement may be supplemented or 
			  modified by agreements entered into between us and an individual 
			  from time to time. In this Privacy Statement, personal information 
			  means any information about an identifiable individual, including 
			  contact and demographic details, not including collective information 
			  or information regarding a group in summarized form.</p>
			<p>Collection of Personal Information</p>
			<p>WebSite's registration form requires users to give us contact information 
			  (such as name and email address) and demographic information (such 
			  as postal code, age, or income level) and other information that 
			  is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information 
			  from the registration form to send the user information that he 
			  or she has requested regarding WebSite or regarding services offered 
			  by us. This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or 
			  print ads. One of the express purposes of WebSite is to gather contact 
			  information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either 
			  online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items 
			  that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views 
			  online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to 
			  contact customers when necessary. We collect customers financial 
			  information (such as account or credit card numbers) to bill the 
			  user for products and services, but retain this information only 
			  as required to process the transaction and for as long as may be 
			  required by law.</p>
			<p>Demographic and profile data is also collected at WebSite. We use 
			  this data to tailor each visitor's experience at WebSite, showing 
			  the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, 
			  and displaying the content according to the users preferences.</p>
			<p>Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (such as 
			  email addresses) and demographic information (such as postal code, 
			  age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send 
			  users information about our products and services. Users may opt-out 
			  of receiving future mailings (see the Opt-Out section below).</p>
			<p>We may use customer information for additional purposes that may 
			  be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. 
			  We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction 
			  completion purposes.</p>
			<p>We use third-party advertising companies like google to serve ads 
			  when you visit our website. These companies may use information 
			  (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) 
			  about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide 
			  advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you 
			  would like more information about this practice and to know your 
			  choices about not having this information, specifically for google, 
			  click here.</p>
			<p>Disclosure of Personal Information</p>

			<p>- by publishing ads either online and/or in print, as the case 
			  may be, in connection with items that are for sale by customers</p>
			<p>- to third party service providers and to affiliated entities in 
			  order to carry out work on our behalf,</p>
			<p>- to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of investigating 
			  fraud or other offences, or</p>
			<p>- to legal, financial, and other professional advisors or in connection 
			  with the sale or reorganization of all or part of its business or 
			  operations.</p>
			<p>- By having your mobile number listed on ads2india.com, you agree 
			  to receive SMS from users who may wish to contact you through WebSite.</p>
			<p>Except as provided above, we will not use or disclose personal 
			  information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, 
			  except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted 
			  by law.</p>
			<p>Cookies and IP Addresses</p>
			<p>We may use your IP address to identify you and your membership, 
			  gather broad demographic information about our users, diagnose problems 
			  with our server, and administer WebSite. WebSite uses cookies to 
			  keep track of your membership tools and to make sure you do not 
			  see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver content specific 
			  to your interests and to save your password so you do not have to 
			  re-enter it each time you visit WebSite. We also provide an option 
			  to log out should you be using an insecure or publicly shared computer.</p>
			<p>We use outside ad companies to display ads on WebSite. These ads 
			  may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of WebSite, 
			  cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, 
			  and we do not have access to this information.</p>
			<p>Links</p>
			<p>This Site contains links to other websites, such as websites providing 
			  national search capabilities and information resources designed

			  or the content of such websites. Please ensure you review the privacy 
			  policies of the websites that you visit.</p>
			<p>Security</p>
			<p>We protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal 
			  information with security measures appropriate to the sensitivity 
			  of the information. However, it is possible that any information 
			  transmitted via the Internet may be intercepted by unknown third
