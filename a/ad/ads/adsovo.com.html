</ul>
<h3>Access to Data</h3>

<h3>Privacy Policy Statements of Members</h3>
<p>ADSOVO encourages all Websites within the Network to create privacy policy statements and provide Internet users with prominently placed access to such statements. Additionally, ADSOVO requests that all Website publishers doing business with ADSOVO disclose any and all information that is being collected from Internet users on their Website, including data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served on their Website.</p>
<h3>Spam and E-mail lists</h3>
