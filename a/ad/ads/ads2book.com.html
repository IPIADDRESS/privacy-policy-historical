															<br>
															<br>
															TIL respects the privacy of it's users and is committed
															to protect it in all respects. With a view to offer most
															enriching and holistic internet experience to it's users
															TIL offers a vast repository of Online Sites and variety
															of community services. The information about the user as
															collected by TIL is: (a) information supplied by users
															and (b) information automatically tracked while
															navigation (Information).
															<br>
															<br>
															<b>By using TIL's website or its services, you
																consent to collection, storage, and use of the personal
																information you provide (including any changes thereto
																as provided by you) for any of the services that we
																offer.</b>
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">USER INFORMATION</span>
															<br>
															To avail certain sites / services on our websites, users
															are required to provide certain information for the
															registration process namely:- a) your name, b) email
															address, c) sex, d) age, e) PIN code , f) credit card or
															debit card details g) medical records and history h)
															sexual orientation, i) biometric information, j) password
															etc., and / or your occupation, interests, and the like..
															The Information as supplied by the users enables us to
															improve our sites and provide you the most user-friendly
															experience.
															<br>
															<br>
															All required information is service dependent and TIL
															may use the above said User information to, maintain,
															protect, and improve its services (including advertising
															services) and for developing new services.
															<br>
															<br>
															Such information will not be considered as sensitive if
															it is freely available and accessible in the public
															domain or is furnished under the Right to Information
															Act, 2005 or any other law for the time being in force.
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">COOKIES</span>
															<br>
															To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users,
															we may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to
															collect information to assign each visitor a unique,
															random number as a User Identification (User ID) to
															understand the user's individual interests using the
															Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify
															yourself (through registration, for example), we will
															have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a
															cookie to your computer. The only personal information a
															cookie can contain is information you supply (an example
															of this is when you ask for our Personalised Horoscope).
															A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our
															advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your
															browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do
															not control.
															<br>
															<br>
															Our web servers automatically collect limited information
															about your computer's connection to the Internet,
															including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your
															IP address is a number that lets computers attached to
															the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the
															web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify
															you personally. We use this information to deliver our
															web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the
															interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
															site and let advertisers know the geographic locations
															from where our visitors come.
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">LINK TO THIRD PARTY
																SITES</span>
															<br>
															TIL includes links to other websites. Such sites are
															governed by their respective privacy policies, which are
															beyond our control. Once you leave our servers (you can
															tell where you are by checking the URL in the location
															bar on your browser), use of any information you provide
															is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the
															site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours.
															If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these
															sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should
															contact the site directly for more information.
															<br>
															<br>
															When we present information to our advertisers -- to help
															them understand our audience and confirm the value of
															advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form
															of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages
															within our site. When you register with TIL, we contact
															you from time to time about updation of your content to
															provide the users such features that we believe may
															benefit you.
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">INFORMATION SHARING</span>
															<br>
															TIL shares the sensitive personal information to any
															third party without obtaining the prior consent of the
															User in the following limited circumstances:
															<br>
															<br>
															a) When it is requested or required by law or by any
															court or governmental agency or authority to disclose,
															for the purpose of verification of identity, or for the
															prevention, detection, investigation including cyber
															incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences.
															These disclosures are made in good faith and belief that
															such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing
															these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and
															regulations.
															<br>
															<br>
															b) TIL proposes to share such information within its
															group companies and officers and employees of such group
															companies for the purpose of processing personal
															information on its behalf. We also ensure that these
															recipients of such information agree to process such
															information based on our instructions and in compliance
															with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
															confidentiality and security measures.
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">ACCESSING AND UPDATING
																PERSONAL INFORMATION</span>
															<br>
															When you use TIL's websites, we make good faith
															efforts to provide you, as and when requested by you,
															with access to your personal information and shall
															further ensure that any personal information or sensitive
															personal data or information found to be inaccurate or
															deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible,
															subject to any requirement for such personal information
															or sensitive personal data or information to be retained
															by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask
															individual users to identify themselves and the
															information requested to be accessed, corrected or
															removed before processing such requests, and we may
															decline to process requests that are unreasonably
															repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
															technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
															would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
															concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for
															which access is not otherwise required. In any case where
															we provide information access and correction, we perform
															this service free of charge, except if doing so would
															require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we
															maintain certain services, after you delete your
															information, residual copies may take a period of time
															before they are deleted from our active servers and may
															remain in our backup systems.
															<br>
															<br>

															<span class="orange_text">INFORMATION SECURITY</span>
															<br>
															We take appropriate security measures to protect against
															unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
															disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
															reviews of our data collection, storage and processing
															practices and security measures, including appropriate
															encryption and physical security measures to guard
															against unauthorized access to systems where we store
															personal data.
															<br>
															<br>
															All information gathered on TIL is securely stored
															within the TIL controlled database. The database is
															stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to
															the servers is password-protected and is strictly
															limited. However, as effective as our security measures
															are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot
															guarantee the security of our database, nor can we
															guarantee that information you supply will not be
															intercepted while being transmitted to us over the
															Internet. And, of course, any information you include in
															a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone
															with Internet access.
															<br>
															<br>
															However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may
															change our privacy policy from time to time to
															incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use
															of any information we gather will always be consistent
															with the policy under which the information was
															collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.
															<br>
															<br>
															We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads
															when you visit our Web site. These companies may use
															information (not including your name, address, email
															address or telephone number) about your visits to this
															and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements
															about goods and services of interest to you.
															<br>
															<br>
