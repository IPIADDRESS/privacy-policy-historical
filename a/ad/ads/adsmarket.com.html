<h1>AdsMarket - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="first">AdsMarket is dedicated to protect your privacy. This statement explains our privacy practices for our site www.AdsMarket.com. We feel it is important that visitors are fully knowledgeable about the use of their personal information. By using our website and/or purchasing our product, you expressly consent to the terms of this policy.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>AdsMarket allows you to visit the website without revealing any personal information. Your visit to this website is anonymous. We will only collect your contact information (first name, last name, billing address, phone number, email address and any other relevant information provided by you) as well as financial information (account or credit card numbers), with your permission and for the sole purpose of processing orders.</p>
<p>The information you provide on our site will not be used for any commercial purposes and will not be sold, rented, leased or otherwise forwarded to any third party. We do not distribute or share your personal information beyond what is strictly necessary to fulfill our obligations to you, and then only with partners who adhere to AdsMarket's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. AdsMarket may provide your personal information if necessary, in AdsMarket's good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant, or order or to protect the rights of AdsMarket or others.</p>
<h3>Web Form Information</h3>
<p>When you submit information to AdsMarket to make a payment or open an account, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, address, email address, credit card number. We do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of eighteen. </p>
<h3>Web Site Usage Information</h3>
<p>We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you access any of our online services. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our Web sites on an aggregate basis, including but not limited to the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web page, and the length of their visits. </p>
<h3>Email Newsletter and Opt-Out</h3>
<p>When submitting your e-mail address to AdsMarket, your e-mail address will automatically be added to our E-Newsletter Subscriber List, which we use to send out special offers or updates that may be of interest to you. AdsMarket will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to non-partner entities. Users may choose not to participate in our mailing program, however. If you no longer wish to receive AdsMarket communications, you may "unsubscribe" from our mailing program at any time by clicking the auto-unsubscribe link in our emails. Our database will then be updated and no further email will be sent to the email address.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are identifiers that a website can send to your browser to keep on your computer in order to facilitate your next visit to the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many websites use them. AdsMarket does not use cookies that persist on your hard-drive. We do use dynamic, non-intrusive session cookies, which reside in your browser's memory only for the duration of your user session, to assist in the ordering and purchasing process. AdsMarket also uses data collected through session cookies for the purpose of identifying the source of traffic (which ad or link you used to reach us), and general patterns of activity on our site. No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie. AdsMarket uses this data to better understand what services and support is valuable to our customers, and how we can continue to provide the best online experience possible to our users.</p>
<h3>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
<p>We may use information in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
	<li>To enhance existing features or develop new features, products and services. </li>
	<li>To provide Advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. </li>
	<li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences. </li>
	<li>For the purposes you specifically provided the information including, for example, enabling us to process, validate and verify purchases. </li>
	<li>To register you as a client and establish an account for you. </li>
	<li>To send you email notifications about our new or existing AdsMarket products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. </li>
</ul>
<p>Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of AdsMarket.</p>
<p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our service agreements or terms of use (for example, to protect our intellectual property rights). We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the law may require us to do so. </p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. We retain personally identifiable information only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, thwart fraud, provide customer service, or maintain your account with us. </p>
<h3>Policy Modifications</h3>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. </p>
<h3>Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>By using the website or any services provided through the website, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy. AdsMarket may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted to this site, so we encourage you to continuously review our Privacy Policy. All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on this website. Your continued use of AdsMarket Software or acceptance of our e-mails following the posting of changes to these terms will indicate your acceptance of these changes.</p>
