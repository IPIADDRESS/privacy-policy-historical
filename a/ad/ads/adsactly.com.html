:: Privacy Policy</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><br>

Welcome to ADsactly (the "Site"). <br>

<br>

We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially 

when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with 

respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting 

business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use 

of the various services offered by ADsactly (collectively, 

"Services") ("Authorized Customers"). <br>

<br>

"Personally Identifiable Information" refers to any information that identifies 

or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such 

information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone 

number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, 

and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not 

include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without 

identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected 

to an identified individual. <br>

<br>

What Personally Identifiable Information is collected? We may collect basic user 

profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following 

additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, 

phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size 

of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the 

Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell. <br>

<br>

How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information? We use Personally 

Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service 

offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email 

Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling 

opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the 

Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors 

and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide 

requested information. <br>

<br>

How is Personally Identifiable Information stored? Personally Identifiable 

Information collected by ADsactly is securely stored and is not 

accessible to third parties. <br>

<br>

What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and 

distribution of the information? Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out 

of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us and/or our 

vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by 

contacting us at admin @ ADsactly <br>

<br>

Are Cookies Used on the Site? Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use 

Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the 

services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our 

Authorized Customers. <br>

<br>

How does ADsactly use login information? ADsactly
uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and 

browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement 

and use, and gather broad demographic information. <br>

<br>

How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable 

Information? Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update 

Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by 

contacting us.<br>

<br>

Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected 

by the Site? We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to 

delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database 

by contacting us. However, because of backups and records 

of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining 

some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally 

Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally 

deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable 

Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward. <br>

<br>

What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes? We will let our Visitors and 

Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such 

changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner 

that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a 

Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we 

will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or 

Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>

<br>

you click on one of these links, you are moving to another web site. We 

encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their 

privacy policies may differ from ours. </font></p>
