                <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
                <p>At Adsy.com, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We recognize that
    privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your
    privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains our policies and procedures
    regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information that we may
    receive from you and other users of the Adsy.com service, through our software, mobile applications
    and our website located at <a href="/" target="_blank">adsy.com</a> (the “Website”). Such
    service, the software, mobile
    applications and the Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the “Service”.
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU CONSENT TO OUR COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION AS
    DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adsy.com reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will notify you
    of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website at
    http://adsy.com/privacy-policy/. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any
    changes. Your continued use of the Service will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Adsy.com collects non-personally
    identifying information that your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This
    information includes your Internet connection and hardware specs, browser type, browser language,
    the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
<p>1.2. Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, we collect your personal
    information such as your full name, credit card information, billing address, your email address,
    history of communication with Adsy.com, history of payments, IP address, system information, and
    your activities on the Website.</p>
<p>1.3. Information Collection. To facilitate your use of the Service, Adsy.com may
    automatically collect certain types of information when you access or use the Service, complete
    surveys, send and receive communications, perform search queries and marketing activities. In order
    to collect this data, Adsy.com may utilize automated tools and files such as cookies and web
    beacons. These automated tools and files may reside on our servers or on your computer or device. If
    you restrict our ability to use automated tools and files, your ability to access and use all or
    part of the Service may be limited or disabled completely.</p>
<p>1.4. Additionally and only upon your grant of respective permissions we may collect information from
    third party service providers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.1. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We use non-personally identifying information we obtain
    by technical means (such as the automatic recording performed by our servers or through the use of
    cookies) for the above purposes and in order to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the
    Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness,
    to better tailor it to most common user needs, to generate and derive useful data and information
    concerning the interests, characteristics and website use behavior of our users, and to verify that
    users of the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>
<p>2.2. Personally Identifiable Information. We use the personally identifiable user information that we
    collect to provide, maintain, protect and improve the current Services offerings, to develop new
    Services, to be able to tailor the Services to one’s specific needs if feasible, for convenience of
    users and communication with them, and as may be required by law. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. DISCLOSURE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.1. Disclosure to Third-Parties. Adsy.com does not share your personal information with third
    parties or the public except as set forth herein. We may share your personal information with our
    third-party service providers, such as SMTP infrastructure providers, analytical services, payment
    processors, merchants, or resellers, performing services, which supplement our Services. These
    service providers may have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions.
    Third parties with whom we share your data currently include, but are not limited to Google, OWOX,
    YouTube, Act-on, Sendgrid, Inspectlet, Adroll, Facebook and Twitter. We do not sell your personal
    information.</p>
<p>3.2. Research. We may use and disclose to third parties information we collect in aggregated,
    non-personally identifiable form for research and informational purposes and to help us make sales,
    marketing and business decisions.</p>
<p>3.3. Events and Webinars. Adsy.com may share the names, email addresses and other details of users
    who register for some of our webinars and events, both online and offline, with the respective
    webinar speakers, announced special guests, our partners at the events, and others. We carefully
    select these persons and require them to use this information for the purposes related to the event
    (including webinars). We will try to label such events (including webinars) on the registration
    forms therefor, but if you affirmatively do not wish your name, email address or other details
    disclosed, please contact us before registering for any Adsy.com event to confirm whether your
    personal information will be shared at the specific event that you are considering. You may not
    opt-out of sharing your information at an event where such information is shared. Your only recourse
    is not to register for an event which so shares information.</p>
<p>3.4. Mergers and Acquisitions. If Adsy.com is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we
    will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users
    notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to any new privacy policy of an
    acquirer of our business.</p>
<p>3.5. Special Circumstances. Adsy.com will not disclose your personally identifiable information
    except as set forth in this Section 3, including in subsections below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when requested to do so by law enforcement agencies;</li>
    <li>when obliged to do so under US law;</li>
    <li>for the purpose of pursuing outstanding debts or liabilities;</li>
    <li>and when given permission to do so by you.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.6. Use of Information for Commercial Purposes. You may object to the use of your personal data for
    commercial purpose at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. INFORMATION STORAGE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.1. Permission to Use Information. By submitting your personal information, you agree to its
    transfer, storage or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
    data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>4.2. Password. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to
    access certain Services or specific areas of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this
    password confidential. We ask that you do not share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>4.3. Disclaimer. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely
    secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security
    of your data transmitted to us via the Internet; any such transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.1. Security Measures. We work hard to protect Adsy.com and our users from unauthorized access to or
    unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. We review our information
    collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against
    unauthorized access to systems.</p>
<p>5.2. Limited Access to Information. We work hard to restrict access to personal information to
    Adsy.com employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it
    for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined
    or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p>5.3. Be Aware. To prevent being a phishing website victim, always check domain details when you are
    providing your personal information. Please, be aware that if you suspect the website you are on is
    a fake site representing to be Adsy.com or to provide the Services, contact us directly at
    support@adsy.com.</p>
<p>5.4. Controlling Your Personal Information. Adsy.com may, from time to time, make available to users
    chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other interactive features. You should be aware that when
    you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) via
    blog, forums, postings, profiles or other areas of the Website, that information, along with any
    substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by
    third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such
    activities are beyond the control of Adsy.com. Please do not post any personal information on the
    Website or in other areas that you expect to keep private.</p>
<p>5.5. Links. For your convenience, we may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals
    to certain third parties’ products or services. If you choose to visit a third party’s website or
    use its products or services, please be aware that the third party’s privacy policy, and not this
    Privacy Policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with
    the third party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self-regulatory
    frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the
    complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data
    protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we
    cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information relating to children. In the event
    that we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from anyone under 18 years
    of age without prior parental consent, we will take steps to promptly delete such information. By
    providing your personal information to Adsy.com, through the Service, you represent that you are at
    least 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. INTERNATIONAL VISITORS AND USERS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Website is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the other regions with laws
    governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are
    transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection
    laws as the other regions and by providing your personal data you consent to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The use of your personal data for the purposes identified above in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy;
    </li>
    <li>The transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. NO ERROR-FREE PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>Adsy.com does not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We may not always catch
    an unintended privacy issue, despite our reasonable efforts to do so. Accordingly, we welcome your
    feedback regarding any privacy concerns that you may have, including how we can improve this Privacy
    Policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt
    corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. LEGAL NOTICES</h2>
