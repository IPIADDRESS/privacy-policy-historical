          <span>Your privacy is of tremendous importance to us.</span>
          <p>Adsimilis.com (the "Website") is an  Internet property of Adsimilis.("us" or "we"). We provide this  privacy policy ("Privacy Policy) so that we may inform you about how  our technology ("Technology") processes information on behalf of the  online advertisers, website owners and other businesses that use our  services. This Privacy Policy also outlines our privacy practices on  our corporate website ("Website") located at <a href="http://www.adsimilis.com" target="_blank">www.adsimilis.com</a>. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@adsimilis.com">info@adsimilis.com</a>.  You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, when you: (1) access  or use the Website; and/or (2) apply for the publisher ("Publisher")  and/or advertiser ("Advertiser" and together with the Publishers,  "Clients") services available through the Website ("Services"). If you  do not agree with the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy,  please do not use or access the Website or apply for the Services.</p>
          <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information:</em><br>
            We  collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from this Website  when you attempt to become a Client or otherwise choose to provide PII  to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a  particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to:  name, address, telephone number, mobile number and/or email address.  For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email  or by completing an online form on our Website. Once collected, we will  store your PII for a reasonable period of time for record keeping  purposes. The information that we store is sometimes deleted as space  requires or in the normal course of business.</p>
          <p><em>Information Sharing: </em><br>
            Adsimilis will not sell, share or rent your PII to or with others.  Your PII is not shared with any third parties, except: (a) where  necessary to conduct business, such as invoicing Clients in connection  with the Services or making payments to, or collecting money from, a  Client; (b) in the case of a breach of any agreement between Client and  Adsimilis; (c) where required by law, or requested by a court of  competent jurisdiction; (d) (c) in the event of Adsimilis bankruptcy, or if Adsimilis is sold or acquired; or (e) where  Adsimilis determines, in its sole discretion, that such  disclosure is necessary to protect the rights of Adsimilis and/or a third party, or necessary to protect Adsimilis from  liability of any kind. </p>
          <p><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </em><br>
            We  collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") from  Website visitors. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used  to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host  address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage  habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your  visit to our Website, the referring URL and/or your computer's  operating system. </p>
          <p><em>Cookies and Web Beacons:</em><br>
            We  use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage our Website. Cookies  are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters.  Web beacons (also known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small  strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on  a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.  Web users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a  setting in their browser. Web users can check their browser supplier's  website for details on how to do this. For more information about  cookies and web beacons please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>. </p>
          <p><em>Third Party Websites:</em><br>
            This  Website may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated  by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from those of Adsimilis. While we endeavor to associate only with reputable  entities, Adsimilis cannot be responsible for the privacy  practices of third party websites. We encourage you to check the  privacy policies of all websites that you visit. </p>
          <p><em>Minors:</em><br>
            This  Website is not intended for visitors that are under eighteen (18) years  of age. Adsimilis does not knowingly solicit or collect  information from individuals under the age of eighteen (18). If we  determine that we have inadvertently collected PII from someone under  eighteen (18) years of age, we will take reasonable steps to purge this  information from our database. We encourage parents and guardians to  spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor  the Internet activities of their children.</p>
          <p><em>Security:</em><br>
            All  collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure  environment. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive  Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect PII  (including Sensitive Information) off-line. Unfortunately, no data  transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As  a result, while we strive to protect our end-users' PII, we cannot  ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to  us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
          <p>Once  we receive the transmission of your PII, we make reasonable efforts to  ensure its security on our systems. Access to this information is  strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. All our end-users'  PII is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the  information to perform a specific job (for example a customer service  representative) are granted access to PII. Employees not adhering to  our policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with  applicable federal and state law, we shall notify you and any  applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an  information security breach with respect to your PII. You will be  notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised  that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law  enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in  remedial measures. </p>
          <p><em>Changes to this Privacy Policy &amp; Notification of Changes:</em><br>
            Adsimilis reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy  at any time by posting a clear and conspicuous notice on the Website  explaining that we are changing our Privacy Policy. All Privacy Policy  changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Website.  Please check the Website periodically for any changes. Your continued  use of the Website and/or acceptance of our e-mail communications  following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute  your acceptance of any and all changes.</p>
          <p><em>Deleting your PII:</em><br>
            If you'd like us to delete any PII that you have provided to us on our Website, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:info@adsimilis.com">info@adsimilis.com</a> and we will process your request, where possible and subject to the  terms and conditions contained herein, within a reasonable period of  time after receipt. </p>
          <p><em>Contacting the Website:</em><br>

          <p><strong>Privacy Practices Applicable to Our Technology:</strong></p>
          <p>Adsimilis' clients are primarily businesses. Our Clients use our Technology to  help deliver online advertisements to consumers while they are online.</p>
          <p><strong>Types of Information that We Collect Via Our Technology:</strong></p>
          <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
            We don't collect PII via our Technology. </p>
          <p><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em><br>
            As  with all web content delivery systems, our Technology records  information about the interaction between a web user's browser and our  servers. Those interactions include advertisement content (banner)  delivery, counting click-throughs on an advertisement, and tracking web  page views after a click-through. Browsers typically provide the  browser version, the operating system, and the IP address of the  computer in use. This Non-PII is collected from web users to assist in  the proper function of our Services, as well as the targeting of  advertisements sent by our customers and the reporting of aggregate  data to both Advertisers and Publishers. Adsimilis does not  collect, use, sell or purchase PII.</p>
          <p><em>Cookies:</em><br>
            Remote  "cookies" on web user computers and server databases at Adsimilis facilities are used by Adsimilis in connection with  the Technology to store information. When used in connection with the  Technology, a cookie is a piece of data placed on the web user's hard  drive by our servers. Cookies are used to improve the experience web  users have when they see web advertisements. Cookies are not viruses  and cannot erase web users' hard drives or otherwise damage web users'  computers. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any PII. </p>
          <p>We  use cookies to ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement,  he/she is sent to the correct click-through destination. They are also  used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad  campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows Advertisers to  determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience that  they reach. Cookies are also used to sequence the delivery of a series  of advertisements to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a  web browser receives any one advertisement. In the course of serving  advertisements to target websites, our Advertisers may place or  recognize a cookie on visiting web users' browsers.</p>
          <p>Web  users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a  setting in their browser. Web users can check their browser supplier's  website for details on how to do this.</p>
          <p><em>Information Sharing:</em><br>
            Web  user information obtained by and through the Technology (all of which  is Non-PII) is shared with our Advertisers and Publishers on an  aggregate basis. This means, for example, that of the millions of web  users that we deliver banners to each month, an Advertiser will know  what percentage of those users viewed their advertisement with a  certain browser. The sharing of this information is essential to  providing the Services that we offer. Adsimilismay augment web  user information with additional Non-PII, such as adding an IP address  to a 5-digit postal code in order to cross-reference in an effort to  improve local targeting of advertising. IP addresses are not linked to  PII by Adsimilis.</p>
          <p><em>Third Party Advertising</em><br>
          In  connection with the Technology we use third-party advertising companies  to serve advertisements when web users visit the websites on which we  serve advertisements. These companies may use information (not  including web users' names, addresses, email addresses and telephone  numbers) about such web users' visits to those websites in order to  provide future advertisements on those websites that may be of interest  to such web users. If web users would like more information about this  practice or would like to prevent this information from being used by  these companies, they may <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br>
