PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Adknowledge, Inc. (the "Company") are discussed in this policy. This policy applies to 
Company's information collection (a) on Company's website (Adknowledge.com and any other websites Company may produce or operate in the future) ("Websites"), 
(b) on various third party websites, and (c) through the use of Company's desktop software applications.
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1. <u>Collection of Information</u>.
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.1 <u>Survey Information</u>. The Company collects information from individuals when an individual voluntarily completes a Company survey, order form, 
or submits information via an online form accompanied by a pre-checked or non-pre-checked checkbox indicating that the individual consents to receiving 
marketing communications from Company (a "Co-registration"), or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, 
order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including 
the Websites and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, via postal mail, using telephones and 
cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the Company or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information 
to the Company, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), 
birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other 
information as may requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Company or third party may also collect information such as what browser 
you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide 
Survey Information to the Company or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from the Company or a Third Party in exchange for providing 
Survey Information to the Company.
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.2 <u>Third Party List Information</u>. The Company may collect information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party, 
and the Company subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information 
may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and 
carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such 
other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List 
Information, the Company seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to the Company and that 
the Company has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.3 <u>Other Information</u>. Other occasions when the Company obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for 
a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by the Company or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Company's customer 
service department, (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Company service or newsletter, and (4) when an individual voluntarily downloads, 
installs, and uses Company's desktop software application(s) (independently or as part of a third party offering (together, "Other Information"). 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.4 <u>Cookies, Web beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology</u>. The Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate 
certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, the Company may use other new 
and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
(a) <u>Cookies</u>. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Company to identify the individual with his 
or her corresponding data that resides in Company's database. You may read more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need 
to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
(b) <u>Web beacons</u>. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming 
function -- see www.www.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to 
a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Company to track certain web sites an 
individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for 
marketing purposes. For example, Company might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products 
are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Company's database, visits the fishing website, Company receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited 
the fishing site, and Company would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. Company may thereafter present offers of 
fishing related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals 
listed in Company's database. If you wish more information about web beacons, you may wish to visit http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
(c) <u>General Behavior Tracking</u>.  The Company may track online behaviors ("Behaviors") through our own technologies, including our desktop software products, 
in order to increase the effectiveness of the advertisements we deliver.  An example of such behaviors may include advertisement responses, web sites that you 
visit, and products that you purchase.  You can prevent your behaviors from being tracked by globally unsubscribing from our marketing materials or by uninstalling 
our software.  As described in Section 2.1, the Company reserves the right to use such technologies for any purpose permitted by law, whether such use is expressly 
specified herein.
</p>
<p class="contentText">
(d) <u>New Technology</u>. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Company's use of new and evolving 
technology. As a result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.5 <u>Outside Information</u>. The Company may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of the 
Company including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.6 <u>Individual Information</u>. As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, 
Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information the Company gathers or receives about individuals.
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.7 <u>No Information Collected from Children</u>. The Company will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If 
the Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately 
deleted from our database. Because it does not knowingly collect such information, to the best of the Company's knowledge, the Company has no such information 
to use or to disclose to third parties. The Company has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
1.8 <u>Credit Card Information</u>. The Company may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the 
card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from Company. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to Company, such information 
is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. The Company will use the Credit Card Information for purposes processing and completing the 
purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.

2. <u>Use of Individual Information</u>. 
</p>
<p class="contentText">
2.1 <u>Discretion to Use Information</u>. THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION. The

As noted below, the Company may update this policy from time to time. The Company may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals

<p class="contentText">
2.3 <u>Targeted Advertising</u>. The Company uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the Internet,

attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in, whether directly or indirectly through behavior 
monitoring. The Company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication

</p>
<p class="contentText">

who have entered a valid email address into a Survey.  The Data Sale Notice will contain instructions on how to 
prevent the individual's data from being sold to such specific third party.  There is no guarantee that an 
individual will receive the Data Sale Notice due to technical failure, service provider email filtering 
mechanisms, or other unpredictable failures of transmission.  Individuals that did not provide valid email
