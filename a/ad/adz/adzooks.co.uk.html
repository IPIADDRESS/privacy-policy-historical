<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<h4>In relation to all web site services offered by TRINITY MIRROR DIGITAL MEDIA LIMITED, trading as ADZOOKS, on this website
</h4>
<p>We are committed to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Protecting the personal information you give us</li>
  <li>Telling you how we use the information we gather about you </li>
  <li>Getting your consent to our disclosure of your personal information. </li>

</ul>
<p>Our privacy policy is set out in detail below. Any changes to this policy 
will be posted here. Please also refer to the Terms and Conditions of this web 
site. When we refer to "we", "our" or "us" in this policy we mean the activities 
of Trinity Mirror Digital Media Limited.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We want to offer you a service which you want to use. We may use 
  information about you to help us customise our site to improve its usefulness 
  to you. It can also help us to choose services we think will interest you. </li>
  <li>Information about you helps us sell space to advertisers of products and 
  services relevant to you so that we can continue to partially fund the site 
  through advertising and you can continue to use parts of the site for free. </li>
  <li>In addition to the services we provide on this web site we want to offer 
  you goods and services provided by us and others which are of interest to you. 
  We will only do this with your consent. </li>
  <li>We compile anonymous records of user trends which we may make use of 
  ourselves, or pass to our associated companies or to unconnected parties. 
</li></ul>
<h4>What information do we collect from you?</h4>
<ul> 
<li>We may collect information from you when you fill in an online registration 
form for any of our web site services, (e.g., chat areas, forums, shopping, 
advisory services, competitions etc). We may also collect information you give 
us over the telephone or in written or other communications. The type of 
information we will collect includes, for example, your name, mailing address, 
email address, telephone numbers, gender, preferences and, where relevant, 
financial, credit card or bank details. </li>
<li>We collect information about your use of our sites' web site services 
through "cookies". Cookies are blocks of text placed in files on your computer's 
hard drive when you visit a website which contain information to identify you. A 
cookie does not contain any personal information you have provided us with, 
except your user name or email address, unless the cookie is attached to 
personal information collected another way, such as by means of your online 
registration form. We use cookies to personalise your visit to our web sites. If 
you do not wish us to use cookies, you can set your Internet browser to reject 
them; further information on how to do this is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, 
or can be found on number of other Internet sites. </li>
<li>Where it is lawful and necessary, we may monitor emails you send and 
receive. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Your consent</h4>
<ul>
  <li>By giving us your details, you confirm that you consent to our sending you 
  direct marketing or information, from us or our associated companies, about 
  products or services that we believe may interest you. You also confirm that 
  we may, from time to time, pass your details to third parties who offer goods 
  and services that we believe may be of interest to you. </li>
  <li>We will not supply your personal information to third parties for their 
  direct marketing activities without your consent. </li>
  <li>If you have already consented to us, our associated companies or third 
  parties, sending you direct marketing or information, but you subsequently 
  decide you no longer wish to receive direct marketing or information from us 
  or our associated companies, or no longer want us to pass your information to 
  third parties, please notify us by email at the following address <a hred="mailto:support@adzooks.co.uk">support@adzooks.co.uk</a>.</li>
  </ul>
<h4>How we ensure privacy is maintained</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We endeavour to ensure that your data is stored securely and to prevent 
  unauthorised access. We have security measures in place to protect your 
  information which we monitor regularly. Unfortunately, despite our measures, 
  because of the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your 
  information will remain at all times 100% secure. The continuing efforts of 
  hackers to defeat even the newest of security systems means that we can never 
  make this promise. </li>
  <li>Please be aware that if you disclose information on chat areas, forums or 
  other public services it may be possible for other people to use this 
  information. We are not responsible for the disclosure of any information you 
  post in this way. </li>
  <li>Our policy is to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998, the Regulation 
  of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications 
  (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and all other legislation which governs the 
  maintenance of privacy in your information. We also require compliance with 
  such legislation by third parties with whom we have arrangements to offer 
  goods or services through our web sites. </li>
  <li>Our web sites provide a number of links to web sites not operated by us or 
  by companies associated with us. We take no responsibility for the use of any 
  information about you which is collected as a result of your use of these web 
  sites and this privacy policy does not extend to any web site operated by 
  anybody other than us. </li>
  </ul>
<h4>Disclosing your information to third parties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The personal information you give us is only disclosed to other businesses 
  if we have your permission. In particular, even where we have your consent we 
  will only disclose your financial, credit card or bank details to our 
  associated companies, agents and/or third party suppliers of products or 
  services on a need to know basis including, for example, in relation to the 
  fulfilment of any e-commerce transactions. </li>
  <li>We may disclose details about use of our web sites to other businesses 
  e.g. to demonstrate patterns of use to advertisers and other business 
  partners. The information we pass on for these purposes will not include any 
  personal information by which you may be identified. </li>
  <li>We may forward your personal details to the Police, or any regulatory 
  body, if we are asked to do so or wish to do so in order to comply with the 
  law or in relation to any suspected misuse by you of our web sites or any of 
  our web site services. </li>
  <li>We endeavour to prevent unauthorised disclosures of your personal 
  information by other people, but we are not responsible for any unauthorised 
  disclosures or other breaches of security or for the actions of others if the 
  information was passed to them with your authority or with the authority of 
  anybody other than us or our associated companies. </li>
