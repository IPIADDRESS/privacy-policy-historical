<h1 class="page-heading">Privacy Policy for AdRoll.com Services</h1>

<p>The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Semantic Sugar Inc. (referred to as "Adroll", "AdRoll.com", "we", "us", "our") and the services provided on the AdRoll.com website (referred to as "Services", "Service").  We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential, especially online.  Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below.  This policy was designed to inform you of the information we collect when you visit AdRoll.com as well as our customer's (referred to as "Advertisers" websites or "Publishers" websites) and then how the information is collected and used by companies that display advertisements (referred to as "Partners").  Those who visit our Advertisers' or Publishers' websites are referred to as "Prospects" throughout this policy.  Because our policy may be updated periodically we encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>How we collect information about you</h3>

<p>When you visit the AdRoll.com website, we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website.</p>

<p>This site uses page referrer data - that is, information about the page that linked you to this page - to determine to what extent our page is referenced by other resources on the Web.</p>

<p>When you are using our Service, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes.</p>

<p>This data may be used to preserve the integrity of our computing resources.</p>

<p>If you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you:</p>

<ul class="privacy-info">
    <li>Contact information - your name, address, email, and other similar information.</li>
    <li>Financial information - the bank account numbers and credit card numbers that you link to your AdRoll.com account. Alternately, we collect your PayPal account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>

<h3>Personal and Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. The PII that Adroll collects from you is information you supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit card number and AdRoll.com account login. That information is maintained by Adroll so that you do not have to enter it each time you visit our website.</p>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by Adroll and Adroll Partners, and is used by Adroll for the purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the advertisements served by Adroll and Adroll's Partners (referred to as "Retargeting"). NPII data collected by Adroll for Retargeting is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser's or Partner's websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual.</p>

<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>

<p>We do not share any PII with any third parties nor do we use any personal information for any purposes beyond those stated here.</p>

<h3>How we use cookies</h3>

<p>"Cookies" are small data files that may be downloaded to the browser on your computer when you visit the Adroll site or an Advertiser or Publisher site and permit the Adroll server or an Adroll Partner's server to identify your browser whenever you interact with the AdRoll.com site or with an Adroll Advertiser or Publisher site. Adroll uses cookies to recognize repeat visits by users of its Service and to collect information about how users interact with the Service. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to streamline the user experiences using the Services and to report such information to Publishers, Advertisers, and Network Operators.</p>

<p>Adroll also uses it's cookies to serve relevant and targeted advertisements through Retargeting.  A Prospect receives a cookie from Adroll and Adroll's Partners when they visit AdRoll.com, and/or when they visit one of Adroll's Advertiser's websites.  When a Prospect visits one of Adroll's Advertiser websites, an Adroll pixel on that site sets a Adroll cookie and Adroll Partner cookies in the browser being used by the Prospect.  When that Prospect visits one of Adroll's Publisher sites or a site where one of our Partners serves advertisements, the cookie storied in the browser of the Prospect will be recognized by Adroll's server or the Partner's server.  The Prospect will then be shown and advertisement from the Advertiser of the site they visited when the cookie was stored.  After this point, Adroll will track how many times the Prospect is shown an ad from that Advertiser and whether or not they clicked on the ad.  This information is part of what Adroll uses in its reporting, but in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of Adroll's Advertiser, Publisher and Partner websites.  Adroll has no access to Partner cookies but requires that each Partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving ads.  Any Partner found in violation of this policy will immediately be removed.</p>

<p>The NPII data collected by Adroll in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by Adroll for the period of one year.  After one year, all cookie data and IP addresses is purged.  This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information.</p>

<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.</p>

<h3>How we protect and store personal information</h3>

<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
