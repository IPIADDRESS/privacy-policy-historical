<p>Want to see spammy ads for mortgages, life Insurance, and long lost classmates?</p>
<p>Neither do we.  That's why we're working with businesses to present ads that are useful for you.  The companies that AdRoll works with will use this ad space to offer you discounts, announce new products, and make recommendations that we think you'll like based on totally anonymous info.  All we recognize about you is your browser, and we do not collect or store any personal information about you.</p>
<p>AdRoll believes in giving you the power to stay in control of the ads you see.  Therefore, we give you the ability to opt out of relevant advertising.  If you do, you will still see ads, they just won't be customized based on what we think you'll actually like. </p>

	<h3>The benefits of interest based advertising:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Save Money:</strong> Relevant ads can offer you deals and discounts that will interest you &amp; save you money.</li>
	    <li><strong>Free Your Inbox:</strong> Brands can market to you without clogging your email inbox with messages.</li>
	    <li><strong>Keep Content Free:</strong>  Free web content is made possible by effective advertising, like retargeting.</li>

<div class="shade-divider spaced"></div>
<p>The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy of Semantic Sugar Inc. (referred to
as "AdRoll", "AdRoll.com", "we", "us", "our") and the services provided on the AdRoll.com
website (referred to as "Services", "Service"). We understand how important it is to keep your
personal information confidential, especially online. Our commitment to protecting your privacy
is outlined in the policies below. This policy was designed to inform you of the information we
collect when you visit AdRoll.com as well as our customer's (referred to as "Advertisers"
websites or "Publishers" websites) and then how the information is collected and used by
companies that display advertisements (referred to as "Partners"). Those who visit our
Advertisers' or Publishers' websites are referred to as "Prospects" throughout this policy.
Because our policy may be updated periodically we encourage you to review these pages on a
regular basis.</p>

<h3>What does AdRoll know about me through the ads they serve?</h3>

<p>We do not know who you are. We do not know your name. We do not know where you live, where you
work, your gender, your age, your email address or any other personally identifiable information
about you. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from the publisher website
on which you may have seen our ads. We do not store your IP address. We do know that the
Internet Browser you are using has visited one of our partner sites (probably an online
retailer) in the last 90 days.</p>

<h3>What information does AdRoll collect about me through their technology and how do they use that information?</h3>

<p>We only collect anonymous data. In order to
identify which products you might be interested in, AdRoll records, via anonymous cookies, which
pages you have browsed on our partners' website. Cookies keep the information of which pages you
viewed, and in certain cases which products you bought. This data is anonymous and exclusively
meant for statistical treatment. There is absolutely no way for AdRoll to identify the visitor.
We do not take any user information from a retailer that they may have stored about you (name,
address, etc). We do not share any data with any site that displays our advertising.</p>

<h3 id="optpolicy">Opt Out / Opt In</h3>

<div id="optin">
    <p>You have opted out of allowing Adroll to select more relevant ads for you. Adroll has placed an
    opt-out cookie in your browser's cache that indicates to our servers that you have opted out. No
    further Adroll cookies will be used. Your decision does not affect ad delivery, but it turns off
    our ability to select the most relevant ads for you or keep track which ads you have seen and
    how often you have seen them.</p>
    
    <p>NOTE: If you delete your cookies or switch to a different browser you will have to repeat this procedure.</p>
    
    <p>If you opted-out in error, or you want to make sure we
    can select more relevant ads for you, click on the link below to reset your Adroll cookie (opt
    in).</p>
    
    <p><a href="#" class="opt-link">Click here if you want to Opt IN</a></p>
</div>

<div id="optout">
    <p>If you no longer want to be exposed to AdRoll personalized
    banners, simply click on the opt-out link below. Please note that this procedure will not block
    ads that are displayed on the websites you visit.</p>
    
    <p><a href="#" class="opt-link">Click here if you want to Opt OUT</a></p>
</div>

<p>
    In order to allow AdRoll advertisers to reach the best inventory online, AdRoll
    buys across multiple networks. In order to opt out of all retargeted ads,
    you must opt out of each of the major networks individually. Click on each link
    to Opt OUT of all AdRoll retargeted ads.

<h3>Account information we collect</h3>
<p>
	AdRoll uses the Evidon assurance platform to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for 
	Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the <a href="http:///aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</a>. 
	As part of this service, AdRoll's online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons 
	that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.</p>
	

<p>If you open an account, we collect the following types of information
from you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact information - your name, address, email, and other similar information.</li>
    <li>Financial information - credit card numbers or PayPal that you link to your AdRoll.com account.</li>
    <li>We may also use aggregate clickstream information we collect from our website users. This information does not personally identify you and is used primarily to monitor traffic to the website, so we can continue to enhance the website and our services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.

</p><h3>Personal and Non-Personal Information</h3>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally
identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is
not otherwise publicly available. The PII that AdRoll collects from you is information you
supply to us; such as your name, email address, credit card number and AdRoll.com account login.
The only PII collected by AdRoll is from AdRoll customers who explicitly register for an account
at AdRoll.com. That information is maintained by AdRoll so that you do not have to enter it each
time you visit our website. No PII is collected from the publisher website on which you may have
seen our ads. </p>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by AdRoll and AdRoll
Partners, and is used by AdRoll for the purpose of improving the quality and relevancy of the
advertisements served by AdRoll and AdRoll's Partners (referred to as "Retargeting"). NPII data
collected by AdRoll for Retargeting is completely anonymous, and only includes information such
as the date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertiser's or Partner's
websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a
specific individual.</p>

<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not
specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact
with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>

<p>We do not share any PII with any third parties nor do we use any personal information for any
purposes beyond those stated here.</p>

<h3>What are cookies?</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping
purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any
personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID cookies
and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A
session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard
drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions
provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.</p>

<p>Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
experience on our site.</p>

<h3>How we use cookies</h3>
<p>"Cookies" are small data files that may be downloaded to the browser on your computer when
you visit the AdRoll site or an Advertiser or Publisher site and permit the AdRoll server or an
AdRoll Partner's server to identify your browser whenever you interact with the AdRoll.com site
or with an AdRoll Advertiser or Publisher site. AdRoll uses cookies to recognize repeat visits
by users of its Service and to collect information about how users interact with the Service.
These cookies contain identification information that enables us to streamline the user
experiences using the Services and to report such information to Publishers, Advertisers, and
Network Operators.</p>

<p>AdRoll also uses it's cookies to serve relevant and targeted advertisements through
Retargeting. A Prospect receives a cookie from AdRoll and AdRoll's Partners when they visit
AdRoll.com, and/or when they visit one of AdRoll's Advertiser's websites. When a Prospect visits
one of AdRoll's Advertiser websites, an AdRoll pixel on that site sets an AdRoll cookie and
AdRoll Partner cookies in the browser being used by the Prospect. When that Prospect visits one
of AdRoll's Publisher sites or a site where one of our Partners serves advertisements, the
cookie stored in the browser of the Prospect will be recognized by AdRoll's server or the
Partner's server. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from the Advertiser of the
site they visited when the cookie was stored. After this point, AdRoll will track how many times
the Prospect is shown an ad from that Advertiser and whether or not they clicked on the ad. This
information is part of what AdRoll uses in its reporting, but in no way can be used to identify
who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of AdRoll's
Advertiser, Publisher and Partner websites. AdRoll has no access to Partner cookies but requires
that each Partner only collect NPII information for the use of serving ads. Any Partner found in
violation of this policy will immediately be removed.</p>

<p>The NPII data collected by AdRoll in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept
by AdRoll for the period of one year. After one year, all cookie data and IP addresses is
purged. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal
information.</p>

<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are
free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of
our website.</p>

<h3>How we protect and store personal information</h3>

<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that
can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not
consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it
does not identify a specific user.</p>

<p>We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US, and we protect it
by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US
federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption,
we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to
personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job
responsibilities.</p>

<p>All credit card information is encrypted with 128-bit SSL encryption before it is transmitted
across the network.</p>


<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We retain the anonymous data that we collect (e.g., which pages you have browsed on our
partners' website) for up to 12 months from the date of collection after which, the information
is destroyed.</p>

<h3>How we share personal information with other parties</h3>
<p>We may share your personal information with:</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
    <li>Credit bureaus to report outstanding negative balance accounts, as allowed by law.</li>
    <li>We may share aggregated non-personally identifiable information about you with Publishers or Advertisers, such as the number of users who visit a Publisher site or the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement. This information does not identify you individually. Further, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of the Publishers that you visit. You should contact Publishers directly and review their privacy policies should you have questions concerning their use of your information such as, for example, communications you may or may not wish to receive.</li>
    <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)</li>
    <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>AdRoll.com complies with all statutory and legal requirements with respect to access to information.</p>

<h3>Unsupervised Children</h3>
<p>Children 18 and under are not eligible to use AdRoll services with participation and
supervision of a legal parent or guardian. AdRoll is not a site meant for children, and we do
not provide privacy measures designed to protect children when using the Internet unsupervised.</p>

<h3>Other Sites Policies</h3>
<p>AdRoll has no control over, nor does it bear any of the responsibility for the privacy
policies and/or content of any sites or advertisers linked to or on AdRoll, or the cookies these
sites might deposit on your hard drive. AdRoll does prefer that Advertisers that have elected to
use AdRoll provide a descriptive privacy policy of their own reachable from their website
describing how they handle Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>

<h3>How you can access or change your personal information</h3>
<p>You can review your personal information and make any necessary changes, at any time by
logging in to your account and changing your preferences in the "My Account" area. You may email
us at support@adroll.com or use one of the alternate contact methods listed below to remove your
contact information from our database provided we have completed all your pending transactions.</p>
