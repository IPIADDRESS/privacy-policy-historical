<div class="Section1">

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">This Privacy Policy ("Policy") sets
forth the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") policies
regarding the collection and use of information via this Portal located at
adr.org and disputeriskmanagement.org (including all pages under such second
level domain names, collectively, the "Portal") and the Portal’s
Internet-based alternative dispute resolution facility ("Online ADR
System"). The Portal is generally accessible by all visitors to the Portal
("Visitors"); the Online ADR System is only accessible by parties who
have registered as users of the Online ADR System ("Parties").</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE </p>

<p>General</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Visitors and Parties understand and agree that
AAA may collect, maintain, and process information provided by them to AAA, and
information collected by AAA concerning such Visitors and Parties, on and
through the Portal and the Online ADR System. </p>

<p>Public Areas of the Portal</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Visitors and Parties may visit the public areas
of the Portal without disclosing any personal information about themselves.
However, Visitors will have the opportunity to request to receive information
from AAA, in which case an e-mail or other address or contact information may
be required in order to allow AAA to comply with the request, and for other
purposes as may be disclosed at the time the request is made ("Special
Purpose Collection"). Visitors may elect to opt-out from receiving
communications other than those relating to the Special Purpose Collection by
(a) following the instructions in OPT-OUT CHOICES, below, (b) checking appropriate
opt-in or opt-out boxes which may be provided on the collection form or (c) as
set forth in the communication sent from AAA.</p>

<p>Online ADR System Registration Information</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">In order to participate in the Online ADR
System, AAA requires Parties to register with the Online ADR System by, among
other things, providing contact information such as (for illustration purposes
only) user ID, password, name, title, department, business address, business
telephone number, business e-mail address and other contact information
("Registration Information"). Certain portions of the Registration
Information concerning the Party will be used for evaluating qualifications for
participation in the Online ADR System. AAA may also use Registration
Information to communicate with Parties regarding proceedings, changes in
Online ADR System functionality, features, billing, help desk and other
activities relating to the operation of the Online ADR System. AAA may disclose
the Registration Information of a Party to administrators, arbitrators and/or
other Parties who are designated by such Party (through such Party’s use of the
Online ADR System or otherwise) to be provided access to such information. At
Your option, some portions of Your Registration Information may be made
available to other users of the Portal in online directories, search features
and/or Peer Groups. AAA may also use Registration Information to send Parties
information about products or services available on or through the Online ADR
System and offers made available by AAA's partners, which may be sent by AAA or
the AAA partner making the offer. Instructions on how to request that AAA not
send future communications (except for communications necessary for the
operation of the Online ADR System) or that AAA not share Registration
Information with third parties, are set forth in OPT-OUT CHOICES, below and,
for AAA transmitted material which is unrelated to the operation of the Online
ADR System, in each communication. </p>

<p>Case Management Information and Materials</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Privacy terms relating to confidential
information and materials a Party submits to the Online ADR System (not
including the rest of the Portal or any public areas of the Portal) in the
course of such Party's ADR proceeding may be set forth in the AAA Rules and/or
any other agreement between the Parties.</p>

<p>Usage Data</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA will record and collect information about
how Visitors and Parties use the Portal, including the Online ADR System. This
data may include a Visitor's or Party's domain name, language, type of browser and
operating system, Internet Service Provider, Internet protocol (IP) address,
the Web site from which they arrived at the Portal, the amount of time spent on
the Portal or using the Online ADR System and the ways in which they use the
Portal or the Online ADR System (collectively, "Usage Data"). AAA
will monitor and use Usage Data in aggregated form to measure the Portal's
performance and Online ADR System activity and improve the Portal's design and
functionality. AAA may also use Usage Data in aggregated form to develop and
distribute to third parties statistical and other information about how the
Portal and Online ADR System are used and for other marketing purposes. AAA may
also disclose aggregate Usage Data to other Visitors and Parties. AAA may also
use Usage Data in unaggregated form to investigate and prosecute security
violations or to identify the particular Visitor or Party who engaged in
particular transactions. </p>

<p>Cookies</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">“Cookies” are pieces of information that are
placed on a User’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily
communicate and interact with the Portal, including but not limited to the
Online ADR System. We use cookies to customize Your experience on the Portal.
We also use cookies to record how many times a user has visited our Portal and
what pages the user has accessed. You may, however, disallow receiving cookies
at any time through Your web browser, although this may affect the usability of
the Portal. It is not our intention to use cookies to retrieve information that
is unrelated to our Portal or Your interaction with our Portal.</p>

<p>Peer Groups</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA may make available certain public and/or
private forums such as bulletin boards, e-mail lists and chat rooms
(collectively, "Peer Groups") on the Portal or the Online ADR System.
Any and all information posted on or through a Peer Group will be generally
accessible for viewing by others. Accordingly, participants are encouraged to
exercise discretion when using Peer Groups.</p>

<p>OPT-OUT CHOICES</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">To "opt-out" of (1) receiving
communications from AAA (except for communications necessary for the operation
of the Portal or the Online ADR System, or as otherwise permitted under this
Policy), (2) having contact information disclosed to third parties (except as
necessary for AAA to operate the Portal and Online ADR System, or as otherwise
permitted under this Policy), or (3) any other consent previously granted for a
specific purpose concerning Your personal information, send an e-mail to the
AAA Data Controller at ecgcustomerservice.org. </p>

<p>REVIEW/CHANGE CONTACT INFORMATION</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Requests to review or change Registration
Information previously provided on or through the Portal or the Online ADR
System may be made to AAA by sending an e-mail to the AAA Data Controller at
ecgcustomerservice.org.</p>

<p>LINKED SITES</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA may provide links to third parties' Web
sites ("Linked Sites") from the Portal or the Online ADR System.
Linked Sites are not necessarily reviewed, controlled or examined by AAA in any
way and AAA is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any
such Linked Sites, or any additional links contained therein. These links do
not imply AAA's endorsement of or association with the Linked Sites. </p>

<p>DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LAW</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA may make information concerning Visitors,
Parties, the Portal and the Online ADR System, and the uses thereof, available
to law enforcement personnel and agencies as required by law or in order to
enforce the Terms of Use, and may disclose such information if required by law
or a judicial or governmental order or subpoena. Where permitted by law, AAA
may also disclose such information to law enforcement personnel and agencies,
or use such information as part of legal process, in order to protect its
property or in furtherance of an investigation regarding a breach of the Online
ADR System's rules and policies or any unauthorized access to or use of the
Portal or the Online ADR System, or any illegal activities concerning a
particular Visitor or Party. </p>

<p>CONSENT TO PROCESSING</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">By using or providing information to the Portal
or the Online ADR System, Visitors and Parties understand and unambiguously
consent to the collection, processing and use of such information in the United
States and other countries and territories, for the purposes of providing the
Portal, the Online ADR System and related services and as otherwise set forth
in herein or in the AAA Rules. </p>

<p>SERVICE PROVIDERS</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA may utilize third parties to provide or
perform certain services and functions on the Portal and the Online ADR System.
For example, AAA may use a Web site tracking evaluation firm to analyze Visitor
and Party's use of the Portal and the Online ADR System, and AAA may use third
party suppliers to provide certain functionality and services provided on the
Online ADR System. AAA will make information concerning Visitors and Parties
and their use of the Portal and Online ADR System available to these service
providers and business partners, as necessary, to perform these functions and
services. The service providers may be located throughout the world; therefore
information relating to Visitors and Parties may be sent worldwide to countries
which have a different level of privacy protection to the U.S. or a Visitor's
or Party's country of residence. </p>

<p>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">In the event of a sale, merger, consolidation,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, change of control or sale or transfer
of the substantial assets of AAA, information collected via or stored on the
Portal or the Online ADR System may be sold, assigned or transferred to a party
acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of AAA related
to the Portal. AAA may also transfer such information to its subsidiaries and
affiliates involved in the operation of the Portal or the Online ADR System. </p>

<p>SECURITY</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA takes seriously the security of Your
personal information. AAA has therefore implemented technology and security
policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction
or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to, such information,
reasonably appropriate to the level of the data concerned. For example, the
Portal implements 128 bit SSL technology to protect certain sensitive data that
is transmitted via the Portal. However, due to the open communication nature of
the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between You and the
Portal, and the Portal and You, or data stored on AAA's systems, will be free
from unauthorized access by third parties.</p>

<p>UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">AAA may, in its sole discretion, update this
Policy at any time and from time to time, by posting the amended Policy on the
Portal. The revised or amended Policy shall be effective upon posting. Any
access to or use of the Portal or Online ADR System following such update shall
be deemed consent to such update. Visitors and Parties are therefore encouraged
to refer back to this page regularly. This Policy may not be otherwise amended
without the written consent of AAA. </p>

<p>CONTACT, QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, COMPLAINTS</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">If You would like to communicate with AAA
regarding privacy issues or have questions, comments or complaints about this
Policy, please forward such communication to ecgcustomerservice.org. </p>
