If you remove information that you have made public on the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. Non-personally identifiable information may be stored indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Instances where we are required to share your information: AdRecover will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AdRecover, our Users or others.</p>

                        <p>AdRecover is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to AdRecover or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or log in credentials) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at support@adrecover.com.</p>
                        <p>We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
