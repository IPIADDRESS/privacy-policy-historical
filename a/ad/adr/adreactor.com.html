                    <p>AdReactor (referred to as "AdReactor" or "we" or "us" or "our") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and handling your personal data in an open and transparent manner. The personal data that we collect and process may vary depending on the service we provide to you. This privacy policy will inform you how AdReactor collects and processes your personal data, and informs you about your rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and any national law supplementing or implementing the GDPR.</p>

                    <h5>Our Data Protection Principles</h5>
                    <p>We adhere to the principles relating to processing of personal data set out in the GDPR which require personal data to be:
                    </p><ol>
                        <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject ('lawfulness, fairness and transparency');</li>
                        <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes ('purpose limitation');</li>
                        <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimization');</li>
                        <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay ('accuracy');</li>
                        <li>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject ('storage limitation');</li>
                        <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures ('integrity and confidentiality').</li>
                        <li>Not transferred to another country without appropriate safeguards being in place (Transfer Limitation).</li>
                        <li>Made available to data subjects and data subjects allowed to exercise certain rights in relation to their Personal Data (Data Subject's Rights and Requests).</li>
                        <li>We are responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the data protection principles listed above (Accountability).</li>
                    </ol><p></p>

                    <p>Under the Data Protection legislation you have the following rights in terms of the personal data we hold about you.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to be informed about the collection and the use of their personal data</p>
                    <p>AdReactor is publishing this privacy policy to keep you informed as to what we do with your personal data. You can ask us for information regarding any data of yours that we keep at any time. This information concerns, among other things, the data categories we process, for what purposes we process them, the origin of the data if we did not acquire them directly from you and, if applicable, the recipients to whom we have sent your data.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to access personal data and supplementary information</p>
                    <p>This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You can obtain a copy of your data from us free of charge. If you are interested in other copies, we reserve the right to charge for the additional copies.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to have inaccurate personal data corrected, or completed if it is incomplete</p>
                    <p>You can request that we correct your data. We will initiate appropriate measures to keep the data of yours that we continuously process correct, complete, and up to date, based the latest information available to us.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to erasure (to be forgotten)</p>
                    <p>You can request that we delete your data provided the legal requirements have been met. In accordance with Article 17 the GDPR, this can be the case if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the data are no longer required for the purposes they were acquired or otherwise processed;</li>
                        <li>you revoke your consent, which is the basis of the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;</li>
                        <li>you object to the processing of your data and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing or you object to data processing for the purposes of direct advertising;</li>
                        <li>the data have been processed illegally.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Where the processing is not necessary:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To ensure adherence to a legal obligation that requires us to process your data</li>
                        <li>In particular with regard to legal retention periods</li>
                        <li>To assert, exercise or defend against legal claims</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to restrict processing in certain circumstances</p>
                    <p>You can request that we restrict the processing of your data if</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You dispute the correctness of the data – for the period of time we need to check the correctness of the data;</li>
                        <li>The processing is illegal but you do not wish to have your data deleted and request a restriction of use instead;</li>
                        <li>We no longer need your data, but you need them to assert, exercise or defend against legal claims;</li>
                        <li>You have filed an objection to the processing, though it has not yet been decided whether our legitimate grounds outweigh yours.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to data portability, which allows the data subject to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services</p>
                    <p>At your request, we will transfer your data– where technically possible – to another responsible entity. However, this right only applies if the data processing is based on your consent or is required to fulfill a contract. Instead of receiving a copy of your data, you can ask us to send the data directly to another responsible entity that you specify.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to object to processing in certain circumstances</p>
                    <p>You can object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons that arise from your special situation provided the data processing is based on your consent or our legitimate interest or that of a third party. In this case, we will no longer process your data. The latter does not apply if we are able to prove there are compelling, defensible reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests or we require your data to assert, exercise or defend against legal claims.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The right to withdraw consent at any time</p>
                    <p>Withdraw the consent you gave us with regard to the processing of your personal data for certain purposes, such as to allow us to promote our products and services to you.</p>

                    <h5>Retaining and Deleting Personal Data</h5>
                    <p>We will keep your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which we initially collected them. Once such period has ended, we will keep your personal data for the longest of the following periods: a) any retention period set out in our retention policy which is in line with regulatory requirements relating to retention; or (b) the end of the period in which legal action or investigations might arise in respect of the services provided. Once the retention period of your personal data lapses, we will ensure that your personal data are either irreversibly anonymized or securely destroyed.</p>

                    <h5>Confidentiality and Security</h5>
                    <p>We deploy various security measures such as encryption and authentication tools in line with the current state of the art to protect and maintain the security, integrity and availability of your personal data. 100% protection against unauthorized access in the case of data transfers across the internet or a website cannot be guaranteed, but we and our service providers and business partners do our utmost to protect your personal data in line with the prevailing data protection legislation by means of physical and electronic physical precautions. Among other things, we use the following measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strict criteria for authorization to access your personal data on a "need-to-know" basis only and exclusively for the specified purpose;</li>
                        <li>Transfer of acquired data in secured form;</li>
                        <li>Storage of confidential data in our secure servers;</li>
                        <li>Firewall safeguarding of IT systems to provide protection against unauthorized access, and</li>
