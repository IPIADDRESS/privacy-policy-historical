					<p>ADLY INC. PRIVACY POLICY<br>
(Last updated June 1, 2011)</p>
<h3>Our Privacy Commitment</h3>
<p>ADLY Inc. (“ADLY,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is committed to  respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the ADLY  (http://Adly.com) websites where this Privacy Policy is posted (the “Site(s)”)  (we refer to the Site(s) and the services made available through the  Site(s), collectively, as the “ADLY Features”). As such, we have  established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to  the Site(s) and users of the ADLY Features how we use and protect the  information we collect through the Site(s). By visiting the Site(s) or  using any of the ADLY Features, you consent to ADLY’s collection, use,  storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set  forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the  date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site(s) and not to  any other website that you may be able to access from the Site(s) which  may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.</p>
<p>This policy answers the following questions:</p>
<p>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</p>
<p>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</p>
<p>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</p>
<p>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</p>
<h3>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</h3>
<h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Personal information means information that can be used to  identify and contact you. You do not need to submit personal information  to access certain areas of the Site(s), but if you do not want to  disclose certain personal information to us, you will not be able to  access certain aspects of the ADLY Features.</p>
<p>We collect personal information when you create an account  through the ADLY Features; participate in polls, surveys, and  questionnaires; participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other  promotions; place advertisements on a Twitter feed, or allow your  Twitter feed to be “sponsored;” or receive customer or technical  support.</p>
<p>To create an account for the ADLY Features, we require you to  provide your name, date of birth; email address, Twitter screen name,  mailing address (if you choose to be paid by check) and phone number.   When you are placing advertisements through the ADLY Features, in  addition to the information above, we will ask for your billing address,  telephone number and credit card or other payment information. You may  also choose to provide us your screen names for certain instant  messaging programs (such as AIM, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo Messenger  and Skype) that you may use if you would like us to contact you through  IM.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may also collect other types of information  (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies,  occupation, platform preferences, and other similar information. This  demographic information may be associated with your personal  information.</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to  fulfill your advertising placements; alert you of new products or  services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service  questions or issues; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities,  contests, promotions, or special events and offers. We also use your  e-mail address to send you messages about the ADLY Features and other  general announcements. If you provide us your IM screen names, we will  be able to contact you through the IM screen names that you submit,  however, those screen names will not be made publicly available to other  users.</p>
<p>We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not  limited to your activity within the ADLY Features. We may use personal  information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response  to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of  any of the ADLY Features. We may also use your personal information to  contact you when necessary.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>“Cookies” are small bits of electronic information that a  website sends to a visitor’s browser and are stored on the visitor’s  hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of  the Site(s) to allow us to provide information which is targeted to your  interests and to make your online experience more convenient. For  example, when you return to one of our websites after logging in,  cookies provide information to the website so that the website will  remember who you are. Should you disable cookies in your browser, you  will have to provide your user ID and password each time you log in.</p>
<h3>Log Information</h3>
<p>Our servers automatically record information that your  browser sends whenever you visit the Site(s). This information includes  your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the  search engine you used to find the ADLY Features, if any, the operating  system your computer uses, which ADLY Features you use and when and how  long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how  users use the ADLY Features, to provide customer service and to maintain  and improve the ADLY Features.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from  children under 13. We take children’s privacy seriously, and encourage  parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at  all times.</p>
<h3>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</h3>
<h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
<p>We may use your personal information to provide analyses of  our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and  other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an  anonymous basis, affiliation, position, interests and other non-personal  information about customers.</p>
<p>In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>Protection of rights. We will  share personal information if we have a good faith belief that (i)  access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is  reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal  process, such as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law  enforcement or governmental authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate  to enforce the Terms of Use for the ADLY Features, including any  investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such action is  necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or  technical issues associated with the ADLY Features, or (iv) such action  is appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of ADLY, its  employees, users of the ADLY Features or others.</p>
<p>Asset transfers. If we become  involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the  sale of some or all of ADLY’s assets, user information, including  personal information collected from you through your use of the ADLY  Features, could be included in the transferred assets.  Should such an  event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through  email and/or a prominent notice on the Site(s).</p>
<p>Service Providers. We may  share your personal information with service providers that we engage  for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf. For  example, we may have partnered with other companies to maintain or  manage the ADLY Features, fulfilling Purchase Orders for advertising or  processing payments. Additionally, we may partner with other companies  to process consumer surveys, fulfill prizes, or to process, analyze,  and/or store data.  While providing services for us, these companies may  access your personal information. To the extent applicable, we require  these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate  confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<h3>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices  of third party websites linked to the Site(s). Although we encourage  such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we  are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal  information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of  other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to  obtain information regarding their information collection, use and  disclosure policies.</p>
<p>When you have clicked on an advertisement or third party logo  displayed on our Site(s) which links you to a different website, our  Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of  the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on  their website.</p>
<h3>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</h3>
<h3>Control of Your Information</h3>
<p>You may delete your account (and thus your personal  information) at any time by accessing the “Delete Account” area of the  ADLY Features, emailing us or notifying us by telephone. Please note  that when you delete your account, we may retain your account  information for a reasonable period of time afterward for the purpose of  internal account management and fraud prevention activities.</p>
<h3>Opting Out of Receiving Communications from Us</h3>
<p>The only way for you to unsubscribe from receiving  communications from us, including messages relating to your account  transactions, is to delete your account.</p>
<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of a country outside of the European  Union, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out  of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you and ADLY will attempt in  good faith to directly negotiate a written resolution of the matter.&nbsp;You  agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days  after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a  dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Los  Angeles, California with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to  resolve the dispute.&nbsp;Should you file any arbitration claims, or any  administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to  resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be  entitled to recover attorney’s fees, even if you would otherwise be  entitled to them</p>
<h3>Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union</h3>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event  that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this  Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data  Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</h3>
<p>The personal information that you provide to us is stored on  servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access,  and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the  security of such information. In addition, we restrict access to  personal information to ADLY employees, independent contractors and  agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate  and maintain the ADLY Features.  All ADLY personnel who have access to  this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such  information.  However, no server, computer or communications network or  system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be  100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information,  we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit  to us or through the use of any of the ADLY Features and you  acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in  such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from  you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.</p>
<h3>European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection – Safe Harbor</h3>
<p>ADLY adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles that were  established by the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the  European Commission to comply with the European Commission’s Directive  on Data Protection.</p>
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time and we will post all changes on this page.</p>
