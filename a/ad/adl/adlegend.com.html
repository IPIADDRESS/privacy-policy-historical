				<p><strong>Online Advertising and Ad Serving</strong><br>
                                TruEffect operates a high volume online advertising service. On behalf of advertisers, we administer banner advertising campaigns across many websites on a daily basis. We provide "targeted" advertising based on geographic segments (country, state, zip code, etc.), techno graphic segments (operating system, browser, domain, etc.), or circumstantial segment (time of day, web page, keyword search terms). TruEffect uses "cookies" to understand web surfing behavior and to anonymously track "unique" users. Cookies are small amounts of data that a website can store on a user’s PC on a temporary or a permanent basis. They are used to remember preferences and shopping cart entries, or more typically, for persistent identification of this browser to a website. Only the website that ’sets’ the cookie can ’read’ the cookie.</p>

				<p>TruEffect uses cookies primarily to remember repeat users, but it also uses cookies to maintain campaign frequency and for other campaign housekeeping functions. In the course of operating online advertising campaigns, due to existing web protocols, TruEffect can collect data related to the current advertising transaction. At the point of getting a request for an ad from a browser, the following information is made available: IP address, TruEffect cookie, Web page the banner is requested from, Search Terms (if in a search context), Browser type and operating system type. This information is used in some cases for "immediate targeting" but it is also collected and analyzed to find predictive patterns of behavior. For example, we may find that a certain pattern is a strong predictor of gender.</p>

                                Although users can’t opt-out of the advertising process, they may control the data collection and targeting process by "opting-out". To opt out of TruEffect data collection and targeting, <a href="http://ad.adlegend.com/TE_optout.html">click here</a>.</p>
