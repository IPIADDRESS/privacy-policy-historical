<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-3">ADP Canada Co. (‚ÄúADP Canada‚Äù) believes that privacy is important to the success and use of the Internet.  This Website Privacy Statement (‚ÄúStatement‚Äù) describes how ADP Canada collects, protects, uses and shares information gathered about you on the ADP Canada Website (the ‚ÄúADP Canada Site‚Äù).</p>


<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-4"><strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">What is personal information?</strong></p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-5">‚ÄúPersonal information‚Äù generally refers to any information about an identifiable individual.</p>
<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-6">  <strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">To what personal information does this Statement apply?</strong></p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-7"> This Statement applies only to personal information collected through the ADP Canada Site.  </p>
<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-8"><strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">How and why do we collect your personal information via the ADP Canada Site?</strong>  </p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-9">ADP Canada collects personal information from you through the ADP Canada Site only for the purposes that ADP Canada identifies to you in a consent statement, which ADP Canada will provide to you at or prior to the time ADP Canada collects such information from you, unless ADP Canada is permitted or required by law to collect such information without your consent.  The consent statement will explain to you (i) the nature of the information ADP Canada will seek to collect, (ii) the purposes for which ADP Canada may use and disclose the information, (iii) the types of organizations with whom ADP Canada may share the information, and (iv) the manner in which you may access and correct or update the information.
  ADP Canada will always collect your personal information by fair and lawful means, and will not seek to collect more personal information from you than is necessary in order to fulfill the purpose(s) ADP Canada identifies to you.  </p>
<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-10"><strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">Does the ADP Canada Site collect personal information from you using technology?</strong>  </p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-11">The ADP Canada Site collects information from you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected.  Specifically, ADP Canada uses cookies (small strings of text that are stored on your computer) to collect information about how you enter (e.g. through a link from a 3rd party site) and navigate the ADP Canada Site, and what information was of interest to you.  ADP Canada uses this knowledge to improve the information and services ADP Canada‚Äôs offer on the ADP Canada Site.  In general, the cookies ADP Canada uses do not identify you by name.  Instead, the cookies ADP Canada uses identify each visitor by the number associated with the computer or device they use to access the Internet (i.e., the Internet Protocol (IP) Address). Such cookies cannot retrieve any other information from your hard drive or obtain your email address without your knowledge.
  ADP Canada may also make use of memory-based cookies to assist in authenticating you as a registered user of certain ADP Canada web applications.  If you are a registered user (meaning that you have a user ID and password to access one of ADP Canada‚Äôs web applications), ADP Canada may use memory-based cookies to remember any preferences you set during a previous use of the application in order to provide you with more direct services based on these preferences when you use the application in the future.  </p>
<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-12"><strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">Do you have to disclose personal information to us to use the ADP Canada Site?</strong>  </p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-13">ADP Canada generally does not require you to disclose your personal information to ADP Canada in order to access, to surf or to view the content on the ADP Canada Site.  You can always choose not to provide your personal information to ADP Canada, although this may prevent ADP Canada from fulfilling a particular transaction that you have requested.  For example, ADP Canada cannot contact you to provide you with information you have requested if you refuse to provide ADP Canada with your contact information. 
  You can also configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is placed on your browser.  Use the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù feature of your browser to obtain more information about these options.  Please note, however, that if you choose to reject all cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of the ADP Canada Site, such as any ADP Canada web services that require registration.  Many features on the ADP Canada Site, however, do not require that you accept cookies.  </p>
<p class="nth-child-even nth-child-14"><strong class="first-child nth-child-odd only-child nth-child-1 last-child">With whom will ADP Canada share your personal information?</strong>  </p>
<p class="nth-child-odd nth-child-15">ADP Canada does not sell or rent the personal information collected through the ADP Canada Site to any third party to use or disclose for its own marketing purposes.  ADP Canada may share this information with service providers that ADP Canada has contracted with to perform services on its behalf, such as data storage, data processing and information technology support, but these service providers are contractually required by ADP Canada not to use or disclose this information except as necessary to perform services on ADP Canada‚Äôs behalf or to comply with legal requirements.
