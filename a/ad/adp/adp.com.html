<span class="legalhd">ADP.com Web Site Privacy Statement</span><br><br> 

<p>ADP believes that privacy is important to the success and use
of the Internet. This statement sets forth ADP's Privacy
Statement for <b>ADP.com</b> and describes the practices that ADP
will follow with respect to the privacy of users of this site.
From time to time, we may change this Privacy Statement. For
example, as we update and improve our service, new features may
require modifications to the Privacy Statement. Accordingly,
please check back periodically.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">What is personally identifiable
information?</p>

<p>"Personally identifiable information" is information about
you, such as name, address, e-mail address, user ID, credit card
number, social security number, and so on.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">How is information collected, used,
and disclosed?</p>

<p>We do not collect personal information -- including your
e-mail address -- unless we first ask you for it. On some of our
sites, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with
information, including your e-mail address, street address,
telephone number or other information so that we may enhance your
site visit or follow up with you after your visit. Whether you
provide any information is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to
the collection and use of your personally identifiable
information as described in this Privacy Statement. In some
circumstances, ADP may share information you voluntarily provide
us with trustworthy business partners. We do not sell or rent
personal information collected through this site to anyone. Also,
ADP may provide aggregate statistics about visitors to our sites,
such as volume, traffic patterns, and related site information to
reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include
no personally identifiable information. ADP may also disclose
information in special cases when we have a good faith belief
that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal
requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend
our rights or property; (c) enforce the Web site Terms and Conditions of
Use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or
others.</p>

<p><b>What are cookies and how are they used?</b></p>

<p>Some ADP sites, like many other commercial web sites, may
utilize a standard technology called "cookies" to collect
information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to
help a web site operator determine that a particular user had visited the
site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that
may have been set while the user was browsing the site. Cookies
are small strings of text that web sites can send to your
browser. Cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard
drive or obtain your e-mail address. If you are simply browsing
an ADP informational site, a cookie may be used to identify your
browser as one that has visited the site before.</p>

<p>We may also make use of memory-based cookies in support of
authenticating the user of certain ADP web applications.
Similarly, if you are a registered user of a site providing
service to ADP clients (and have a user ID and password), we may
use cookies so that we can provide personalized information based
on preferences you have indicated while using the site. Although
you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all
cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies,
it may not be possible to utilize ADP services which require
registration if you reject cookies.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">What are your choices regarding
collection, use, and distribution of your information?</p>

<p>If you have voluntarily provided information, you consented to
the collection and use of your personally identifiable information as described
in this Privacy Statement. If, in connection with your use of a
particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not
described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit
that use, you can choose not to use the particular service.</p>

<p>If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from
time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and
services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings,
you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on
the submission form.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">How can you correct, access, and
update your information?</p>

<p>You may view and edit your personally identifiable information
at any time by contacting us using the link provided on the web
site.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">How do we protect your
information?</p>

<p>We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable
information. This includes, among other things, using industry
standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion
detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data
transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally
identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to us or receive from
us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us
via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until
it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our
best effort to ensure its security on our servers.</p>

<p>Internally, we will restrict access to your personally
identifiable information to employees who need access to the
information in order to do their jobs. These employees are
limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies.</p>

<p>We will review our security arrangements from time to time as
we deem appropriate.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">How can you help protect your
information?</p>

<p>If you are using an ADP web site for which you registered and
chose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your
password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an
unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember
to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window
when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others
cannot access your personal information and correspondence if
others have access to your computer.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Other sites</p>

<p>ADP sites may contain links to other sites, including those of
our business partners. While we seek to link only to sites that
share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not
responsible for the privacy practices employed by other
sites.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement,
you should contact us at <a href="mailto:ES_Privacy@adp.com">
ES_Privacy@adp.com</a>.</p>
