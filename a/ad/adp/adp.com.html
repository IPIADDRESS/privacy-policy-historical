If, in connection with your use of a particular service, we ask to use your data in a way not described in this Privacy Statement and you do not wish to permit that use, you can choose not to use the particular service. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-20"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-21">If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, we may, from time to time, send you mail or e-mail regarding products and services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate that by checking the appropriate box on the submission form. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-22"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-23"><strong class="nth-child-even nth-child-24">How can you correct, access, and update your information?</strong><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-25">You may view and edit your personally identifiable information at any time by contacting us using the link provided on the web site. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-26"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-27"><strong class="nth-child-even nth-child-28">How do we protect your information?</strong><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-29">We exercise great care to protect your personally identifiable information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and site monitoring. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via e-mail. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our servers. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-30"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-31">Internally, we will restrict access to your personally identifiable information to employees who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees are limited in number, and are committed to our privacy policies. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-32"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-33">We will review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-34"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-35"><strong class="nth-child-even nth-child-36">How can you help protect your information?</strong><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-37">If you are using an ADP web site for which you registered and chose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also remember to sign out of the registered site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer. <br class="nth-child-even nth-child-38"><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-39"><strong class="nth-child-even nth-child-40">Other sites</strong><br class="nth-child-odd nth-child-41">ADP sites may contain links to other sites, including those of our business partners.
