  <div style="width:760px; line-height:1.6em;">
  <p><em>  Last Updated October 20, 2009</em></p>
  <p><strong>Overview of Our Services&nbsp; </strong><br>
    AdBrite is an advertising exchange where  third party advertisers (“<strong>Advertisers</strong>”) may distribute online text,  banner, full page or inline advertisements (“<strong>Ads</strong>”) to advertising zones (“<strong>Ad Zones</strong>”)  located on Internet websites that are owned or operated by other third parties  (“<strong>Publishers</strong>”).  &nbsp;Advertisers and Publishers can manage  their accounts on our exchange through a self-service account management  interface (“<strong>Interface</strong>“)  located at adbrite.com (“<strong>Our</strong> <strong>Website</strong>”).&nbsp;  A Publisher website to which we deliver Ads is sometimes referred to in  this Policy as a <strong>Publisher Site</strong> and all Publisher Sites are sometimes  referred to collectively in this Policy as the <strong>Publisher Network</strong>. &nbsp;To avoid any confusion, you should understand  that while we own and operate Our Website, we do <u>not</u> own or operate any  Publisher Site.&nbsp; <br>
  AdBrite seeks to optimize the delivery  of Ads to Ad Zones within the Publisher Network using auction pricing,  real-time bidding, API functionality, behavioral targeting and unparalleled  access to campaign information. This privacy policy is intended to inform you  about our collection, use, storage and disclosure of information that we  collect or record in the course of providing these services.</p>
  <p><strong>Overview of Our Users</strong><br>
  Three types of users interact with us. For  ease of reference, we use the following definitions in this Policy:&nbsp; <strong>Surfers</strong> are users who navigate to  AdBrite.com.&nbsp; <strong>Members</strong> are Advertisers or  Publishers who have completed our registration process and accepted our terms  of use, or Advertisers who have signed written agreements with us for the  management of their accounts. &nbsp;Members  also include <strong>Managed  Advertisers </strong>who have signed  written agreements with us for the management of our services<strong>.&nbsp; Viewers</strong> are users who view or click on an Ad Zone that is powered by AdBrite. Depending  on your particular interaction with us, different portions of this policy may  apply to you at different times.</p>
  <p><strong>Are you agreeing to anything by  providing us information?</strong><br>
  BY NAVIGATING TO OUR WEBSITE ON OR AFTER  THE DATE THAT THIS POLICY WAS LAST UPDATED, YOU CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, USE  AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR SESSION DATA AS DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. &nbsp;BY REGISTERING AS A MEMBER, SIGNING A WRITTEN  AGREEMENT WITH US AS A MANAGED ADVERTISER OR SUBMITTING TO US EMAIL  COMMUNICATIONS ON OR AFTER THE DATE OF THIS POLICY, YOU CONSENT TO THE  COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, SESSION DATA AND  ACCOUNT DATA AS DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO HAVE YOUR  INFORMATION USED AS DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY, YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE OF OUR  WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES IMMEDIATELY. </p>
  <p><strong>What types of Information do we collect  from you and why?</strong><br>
    <strong>Personal Information</strong> is information that can be associated with a particular person or entity.&nbsp; Personal Information does not include IP  addresses or information that has been anonymized so that it cannot identify a  particular user using reasonable efforts. &nbsp;Examples of Personal Information are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>telephone number</li>
    <li>email address</li>
    <li>credit card  number (Advertisers only)</li>
    <li>Tax ID or Social  Security Number (Publishers only)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We collect Personal Information from Members so that we can transact business  with Members and report Publisher payments to the IRS.&nbsp; We also collect Personal Information from  electronic mail sent to us (“<strong>Email Communications</strong>”), so that we can  substantiate and follow up upon the information contained in the Email Communications.&nbsp; Email Communications can be sent by either  Members or Surfers, and include the following types of communications:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copyright infringement notifications under the Digital  Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other applicable law (“<strong>Take-Down Notices</strong>”)</li>
    <li>Notices of violations of our Subscriber Agreement or  our acceptable use policies (“<strong>Violation Notices</strong>”)</li>
    <li>Requests for assistance from our support department</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect Personal Information  from Viewers.&nbsp; We do not merge Personal  Information that we derive from Email Communications with other Personal  Information.&nbsp; We do not merge Personal  Information that we collect from Members with Non-Personal Information that we  collect from Viewers or Surfers.&nbsp; We <u>do</u> merge Personal Information that we collect from Members with Non-Personal  Information that we collect from Members.&nbsp; <br>
      <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> is any information other than Personal Information. We collect three types of  Non-Personal Information from users:<br>
      <strong>Session Data</strong> is information we collect from Surfers and Members to  assist them with navigation on Our Website and to allow us to make improvements  to Our Website.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Account Data </strong>is information we collect from Members that is not  Personal Information or Session Data.&nbsp;  This information is necessary for us to transact business with Members,  as well as to prevent and detect fraud. While Account Data is not Personal  Information, it is associated with a particular Member account and may  therefore be merged with the Personal Information or Session Data of that  Member. &nbsp;Examples of Account Data that we  collect from Members are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bid, budget,  reserve price and targeting information we receive from Advertisers through the  Interface</li>
    <li>Ad Zone and Ad  approval information we receive from Publishers through the Interface</li>
    <li>The date, time and  IP address of a Member’s initial registration and any subsequent login to the  Interface </li>
    <li>Certain activities  of a Member using the Interface, such as the creation or deletion of a  Publisher’s Ad Zone or the adjustment to an Advertiser’s budget or bid</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Viewer Data </strong>is information we collect about Viewers. We use Viewer  Data to optimize the delivery of Ads to Ad Zones so that, for example, we are  less likely to deliver an Ad targeted toward men to a Viewer we believe is a  woman, and we are less likely to deliver the same Ad repeatedly to the same  Viewer. We also use some Viewer Data for fraud prevention and detection and to  document transactions for invoicing and commission purposes. Examples of Viewer  Data that we collect from Viewers are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The type and  version of browser and operating system used by the Viewer (“<strong>System Info</strong>”)</li>
    <li>The approximate  geographic location of the Viewer based on their IP address (“<strong>Geographic Info</strong>”)</li>
    <li>The most recent  Publisher Sites to which the Viewer has navigated </li>
    <li>Any past Ads that  the Viewer has viewed or on which the Viewer has clicked </li>
    <li>Any past  conversions from Ads by the Viewer of which we are aware</li>
    <li>Any other  inferences we make regarding a Viewer (e.g., is likely to be a man) or their  preferences (e.g., appears to like gardening)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What types of Information do we collect  from children?</strong><br>
  We do not intentionally collect Personal  information or Non-Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.  However, if a child under 13 years of age navigates to Our Website or to one of  our Ad Zones or Pixels on a Publisher Site, we may store Session Data and/or Viewer  Data on their browser as we would with any other Surfer or Viewer. If you have  reason to believe that a child under 13 years of age has provided us with Personal  Information, please contact us at privacy@adbrite.com.</p>
  <p><strong>How do we collect information from you?&nbsp; </strong><br>
    <em>Personal  Information</em>. We collect Personal  Information from Members through the online registration process, though  sometimes this information is given to us offline and entered by us online on the  Member’s behalf.&nbsp; We require Members to  keep this information updated as they continue to use our services. We also  collect Personal Information from Members and Surfers from Email Communications  that they send to us.&nbsp; <br>
    <em>Session Data</em>.&nbsp; We collect  Session Data from Surfers when they navigate to adbrite.com by setting Cookies  on their browser. &nbsp;We collect Session  Data from Members when they log into our Interface by setting Cookies on their  browser and by recording Session Data in our action logs. <br>
    <em>Account  Data</em>.&nbsp;  We collect Account Data from Members through the Interface as they  register, log in or out, or make decisions on the Interface with respect to  their Ads or Ad Zones. Some of this Account Data is collected when a Member  enters information into the Interface in response to a query, while other  Account Data is recorded by us in our action logs. </p>
  <p><em>Viewer Data</em>.&nbsp; We collect System Info from Viewers using information  transmitted by their browser and Geographic Info from Viewers from information  associated with the Viewer’s IP address. We collect other Viewer Data from  Cookies and Pixels. If you are a Viewer, whenever you view an Ad Zone that is  part of the Publisher Network, we will set or update one or more Cookies on your  browser. Each time you view an Ad Zone, click on an Ad or take any action with  a vendor that resulted from an Ad (such as completing a lead form or purchasing  a product or service) we may update those Cookies and we may update a Log File associated  with that Ad Zone display to record your interests or preferences. We also contract  with third party data providers to purchase Viewer Data from them. This data is  referred to below as <strong>Third Party Viewer Data</strong>.&nbsp; In order to match Third Party Viewer Data  with you, we may allow third parties to drop our Pixel on Web pages to which  you navigate so that we can update the Cookie we put on your browser.</p>
  <p><strong>What are Cookies, Pixels and Log Files?&nbsp; Can you refuse them?</strong><br>
    A <strong>Cookie</strong> is a small packet of data that is stored on your Internet browser.&nbsp; We use Cookies to store Session Data and Viewer  Data. We assign a randomly-generated identifier (not your actual identity) to  your browser (“<strong>Visitor  ID</strong>”) and store it in a Cookie so that a website can recognize your  browser the next time you visit the website.&nbsp;  Cookies allow us to store Viewer preferences, customize the display of  content on a Viewer’s browser and record activities relating to Ad Zones so  that Viewers will receive more relevant and less repetitive Ads when they next  encounter an Ad Zone. &nbsp;Most browsers are set  up initially to accept Cookies.&nbsp; There  are three ways you may refuse Cookies:&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may set your  browser to disable or delete all third-party Cookies.&nbsp; The mechanics to do this vary by browser and  you should check your browser’s help file to learn how to take either  action.&nbsp; If you disable or delete Cookies  at the browser level, the features and functionality of many websites may be  affected and you may see the same content and Ads repeatedly on some websites.  For example, if you were a Member and you elected to disable Cookies, you would  not be able to use any of the authenticated services we provide on Our Website. </li>
    <li>You may set your  browser to prompt you each time a website wants to set a Cookie and ask for  your permission.&nbsp; By refusing permission  to any given Cookie, you will prevent only a single Cookie from being  created.&nbsp; Note, however, that because of  the number of Cookies set by some websites, choosing to review Cookies on an  individual basis may prove to be burdensome and may interfere with the features  and functionality of some websites, including Our Website.</li>
    <li>You may elect to  use our Opt-Out tool.&nbsp; If you elect to  use this tool, we will delete most Viewer Data (such as your estimated age,  gender, interests and preferences) from your browser and we will set a new ‘<strong>Opt-Out Cookie</strong>”  on your browser that will instruct our system not to store any of this data in  the future and not to use any remaining Viewer Data we have (such as  information regarding Ads you have previously seen) to target Ads to you in the  future. <a href="http://www.adbrite.com/mb/behavorial_optout.php">Click here</a> to set an Opt-Out Cookie on your browser. Please note:<ul>
    <li>Because the  Opt-Out Cookie is a Cookie-based solution, it will not function if you disable all  Cookies at the browser level. Likewise, if you set an Opt-Out Cookie and then  later delete all Cookies from your browser, you will also delete the Opt-Out  Cookie and we will begin to collect Viewer Data from you again until you set a  new Opt-Out Cookie. </li>
    <li>Setting an  Opt-Out Cookie will not block us from setting Cookies on your browser that  collect Session Data and Viewer Data that is not used to target Ads to you.</li>
    <li>An Opt-Out Cookie  is specific to one browser. If you set an Opt-Out Cookie on one browser and  then use another browser from the same computer, the Opt-Out Cookie will not  stop the second browser from accepting Cookies from us that collect Viewer Data. </li>
  </ul></li></ul>
  <p>A <strong>Pixel</strong> (also known as a web beacon) is an image on a website page that may not be visible  to the naked eye. We use Pixels to convey Viewer Data to your browser or to our  Log Files.&nbsp; Viewing a screen with a Pixel  may instruct your browser to update a Cookie associated with that Pixel. For  example, if we wanted to record whether a product was purchased using your  browser, we would place a Pixel on the Advertiser’s site so that when the  purchase was completed, the Cookie on your browser would be updated to reflect  the purchase. At the same time, we would record the purchase in a Log File.&nbsp; Most browsers are set up initially to accept Pixels.&nbsp; There are two ways to prevent Pixels from  recording information about your web activities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may set your  browser controls to reject all third party image tags. The mechanics to do this  vary by browser and you should check your browser’s help file to learn how to take  this action.&nbsp; Please note, however, that rejecting  all third party image tags may interfere with the features and functionality of  many websites, including Our Website. </li>
    <li>Because Pixels are  used to update Cookies on your browser, you may also instruct your browser to disable  or delete Cookies or to ask permission before a Cookie is accepted, or you may  set an Opt-Out Cookie on your browser. These actions would render ineffective  Pixels that record Viewer Data in your Cookies and would delete the Visitor ID  from your browser, rendering anonymous Log File information recorded from other  Pixels.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A <strong>Log File</strong> is a temporary file we create and  store on our system to store everything we know about the display of an Ad Zone.  A Viewer’s Visitor ID is noted in the Log File. You cannot elect to disable Log  Files, though if you delete Cookies or set an Opt-Out Cookie, you will delete  the Visitor ID from your browser and there would be no way to tie a particular  Log File back to your browser.<br>
  Please note that disabling Cookies or  Pixels on your browser or setting an Opt-Out Cookie does not mean you will no  longer receive online Ads from us. It means that we will no longer be able to  deliver Ads to you that are tailored to your preferences or to limit the number  of times you see the same Ad.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Can you see or change the information we  collect?</strong><br>
    <em>Personal  Information</em>.&nbsp; Members can see the Personal Information we  collect from them by logging into the Interface at <a href="https://www.adbrite.com/zones/commerce/manage_account.php">https://www.adbrite.com/zones/commerce/manage_account.php</a>,  except for certain credit card information that is not stored or that is masked  for security reasons and Personal Information derived from Email  Communications. Members can change the Personal Information we collect from  them through the Interface (except for Personal information derived from Email  Communications), though for auditing and fraud detection purposes, we continue  to store Personal Information previously entered by a Member even after it is  modified or deleted by the Member. Members and Surfers cannot see or change the  Personal information we derive from Email Communications. </p>
  <p><em>Account  Data.&nbsp; </em>Members can see and change Account Data that was entered by the Members  into the Interface, such as bid and budget information we collect from  Advertisers and Ad Zone and Ad approval information we collect from Publishers,  by logging into the Interface at <a href="https://www.adbrite.com/zones/commerce/manage_account.php">https://www.adbrite.com/zones/commerce/manage_account.php</a>.&nbsp; Members cannot see or change Account Data we  record in our action logs on behalf of Members, such as the date and time they  last logged into the Interface or their most recent activities using the  Interface.</p>
  <p><em>Session  Data</em>. Surfers can see Session Data we  collect from them using the tools available in their browser to view Cookies  and can delete this Session Data by deleting the associated Cookies from their  browser. &nbsp;Similarly, Members can see  Session Data we collect from them that is stored on their browser using the  tools available in their browser to view Cookies and can delete this Session  Data by deleting the associated Cookies from their browser.&nbsp; Members cannot see, modify or delete Session  Data we collect from them that is stored on our system. &nbsp;Surfers cannot see or change the Session Data  we send to third parties to assist us in designing and improving Our Website.</p>
  <p><em>Viewer  Data</em>.&nbsp;  Viewers can see the Viewer Data we store in Cookies by using the tools  available in their browser to view Cookies. Viewers cannot change this Viewer  Data, but a Viewer can elect to delete Cookies, to disable cookies, to limit  Cookies to those that are pre-approved or to block Cookies that record Viewer  Data by setting an Opt-Out Cookie.&nbsp;  Viewers cannot see or change the Viewer Data we store in Log Files, though  if you delete Cookies or set an Opt-Out Cookie, you will delete the Visitor ID  from your browser and there would be no way to tie a particular Log File back  to your browser.</p>
  <p><strong>Where and for how long do we store  information that we collect?&nbsp; </strong><br>
    <em>Personal Information and Account Data</em>.&nbsp; We store all Personal  Information and Account Data in our data centers, except for Personal  information derived from Email Communications.&nbsp;  We keep all Personal Information and Account Data we collect from  Members indefinitely, though we reserve the right to delete such information at  any time at our convenience. Personal Information derived from Email  Communications is stored by a third party service provider on their network for  up to three years after it is sent to us, except for Take-Down Notices and Violation  Notices which we may retain indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em>Session Data</em>.&nbsp; We store Session Data in Cookies on a  Surfer’s or Member’s browser and/or in our data centers. &nbsp;Session Data stored in Cookies is retained  until it is overwritten at a later time with new Session Data or until a Surfer  or Member deletes the Cookies from his or her browser. Session Data stored in  our data centers is retained indefinitely, though we reserve the right to  delete such information at any time at our convenience.&nbsp; The third party we use to assist us with  website design may keep Session Data it collects indefinitely, but our only  access to this data is on an aggregate basis (e.g., 200 users clicked on a  specific link on Our Website in January).&nbsp; </p>
  <p><em>Viewer  Data</em>.&nbsp;  We store Viewer Data about Viewers on Cookies in a Viewer’s  browser.&nbsp; Currently, we retain this Viewer  Data until we record more recent or relevant information over that data.&nbsp; We also store Viewer Data in our Log Files  which are maintained in our data centers. &nbsp;Log Files are currently retained for two weeks,  except for one day of Log Files each year that is retained for auditing  purposes for seven years.&nbsp; At the request  of a Third Party, we will delete any Third Party Viewer Data from a Viewer’s  Cookies when the Viewer next encounters one of our Ad Zones one year after the  Third Party Data was recorded on the Cookies.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>What security measures do we use to  protect information that we store?</strong><br>
    We maintain commercially  reasonable security protections to protect information we collect from loss,  misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. For  example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information we  collect is not publicly accessible from Our Website. </li>
    <li>We use a  multi-level, password protected security system to control access to  information stored about users. In particular, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)  encryption to protect Personal Information we collect from Members through the  Interface, though a Member can opt out of using SSL if they choose. </li>
    <li>We maintain  strict physical security of our properties and facilities and only provide  access to authorized personnel. </li>
    <li>We are certified  as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) data security standard  pertaining to the security of credit card information. </li>
    <li>We restrict  access to personal information to employees, contractors and agents who need to  know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.  AdBrite employees are bound by confidentiality obligations to the company and  may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these  obligations. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>While we try our  best to safeguard and protect all information we collect, please be advised  that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely  secure. Furthermore, Session Data and Viewer Data (other than in Log Files) are  stored on a user’s browser, not in our network, and security measures for such  information are the responsibility of the user operating the browser.</p>
  <p><strong>Who do we share your information with?</strong><br>
      <em>Personal Information and Account Data</em>.&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>

In the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or other insolvency  event, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated  by a Successor Company.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Other third  parties, with your consent or at your direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How can you prevent us from sharing  information we collect from you with third parties?</strong><br>
    If you wish to opt  out of receiving Targeted Emails, you may click the link provided at the bottom  of any Targeted Email to unsubscribe. &nbsp;You  may also request that we edit out your name and contact information from  forwarded Violation Notices and we will honor your request. For legal  compliance reasons, however, we will forward any Take-Down Notice we receive to  the third party whose conduct is the subject of the Take-Down Notice without  any deletions.&nbsp; Except as described in this  section, you may not restrict us from sharing information that we collect from  you with the third parties described above.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the obligations of third parties with respect to your  information?</strong><br>
    AdBrite has non-disclosure agreements in  place with third parties to whom we may disclose your Personal information and  Non-Personal information under this Policy. These agreements require the third  parties to keep such information confidential and to use the information only  for purposes of carrying out their business relationship with us. In most  cases, however, these agreements apply only to information that we collect from  you and disclose to them -- and not to information that they collect from you  directly.&nbsp; Please note that AdBrite does  not own or control any Publisher Site in the Publisher Network or any website  owned or operated by an Advertiser. Although we choose our Advertisers and  Publishers carefully and encourage them to follow reasonable privacy practices,  we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites and  they are under no obligation to comply with this Policy. &nbsp;Before visiting another website and before  providing any information to the party that operates or advertises on that  website, you should review the privacy policy and practices of the website to  determine how information that they collect from you will be handled.</p>
  <p><strong>In what countries will your information  be processed?</strong><br>
  WE PROCESS INFORMATION ON SERVERS  LOCATED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN EUROPE.&nbsp; DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF A MEMBER, WE MAY  TRANSFER AND/OR PROCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ACCOUNT DATA OUTSIDE THE  COUNTRY OF THAT MEMBER. SIMILARLY, DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF A VIEWER AND  THE NATURE OF THE PUBLISHER SITE TO WHICH THE VIEWER NAVIGATES, WE MAY TRANSFER  AND/OR PROCESS TARGETING DATA OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY OF THAT VIEWER. BY PROVIDING  INFORMATION TO US, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU  AGREE TO PERMIT US TO COLLECT, TRANSMIT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND  NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION ANYWHERE THAT WE DEEM NECESSARY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF  OUR SERVICES -- INCLUDING ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND IN THE UNITED  STATES -- AND THAT SUCH USE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS STATED  IN THIS POLICY AND OUR SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, IN THE CASE OF THE  UNITED STATES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO  GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, REGULATORS, OR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH  APPLICABLE LAWS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE USA PATRIOT ACT.</p>

  We may update this  Policy from time to time.&nbsp; We encourage  you to visit this page periodically to review our current policy so that you  will always know what information we collect and how we may use and disclose that  information.&nbsp; When we update this Policy,  we will change the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Policy.
