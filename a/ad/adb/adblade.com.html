Serving</strong><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">
<br><br>Adblade partners with numerous companies to provide online
advertisements to "End Users" which are human users across
various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he
or she may visit web-pages that include references to Adblade's
advertising service. When this happens, an End User's browser may
request advertisements from Adblade's system. <br>When Adblade
receives these requests, we may record information about this
interaction (as well as any further interaction with our
advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the
End User's IP address and time of request, information about the
general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an
advertisement and other information made available by the
browser.<br><br>Additionally, Adblade employs small text files stored
on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of
better tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over
time. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along
with information about the particular types of content in which the
End User has shown interest. <br><br>On occasion, partner sites,
vendors or internally run surveys may provide us with additional
information about End Users. In these situations, all information is
kept entirely anonymous and does not include any type of personally
identifiable information. Adblade only accepts this information from
organizations with clearly available and visible privacy policies.
<br><br>Adblade does not sell information it collects about End
Users. However, Adblade may share data about aggregate usage
statistics with the public or other businesses with whom we work. 
<br><br>The capture, storage and analysis of information are solely
for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience,
eliminating fraudulent activity, and system administration. <br><br></font></font></font><strong class="western">Adblade
