<strong class="western">Overview</strong>
<br>Adblade.com and its network of owned and partnered publishers
("Adblade") places importance on the privacy of our clients
and their businesses. We adhere to the policies regarding privacy and
security outlined below. If you have any questions, comments or
concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at
<u><a class="western" href="mailto:privacy@adblade.com" target="_blank">privacy@Adblade.com</a></u>
Please familiarize yourself with the below sections that are
applicable to you. <br><br><!--<STRONG CLASS="western"-->Ad
Serving
<br><br>Adblade partners with numerous companies to provide online
advertisements to "End Users" which are human users across
various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he
or she may visit web-pages that include references to Adblade's
advertising service. When this happens, an End User's browser may
request advertisements from Adblade's system. <br>When Adblade
receives these requests, we may record information about this
interaction (as well as any further interaction with our
advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the
End User's IP address and time of request, information about the
general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an
advertisement and other information made available by the
browser.<br><br>Additionally, Adblade employs small text files stored
on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of
better tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over
time. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along
with information about the particular types of content in which the
End User has shown interest. <br><br>On occasion, partner sites,
vendors or internally run surveys may provide us with additional
information about End Users. In these situations, all information is
kept entirely anonymous and does not include any type of personally
identifiable information. Adblade only accepts this information from
organizations with clearly available and visible privacy policies.
<br><br>Adblade does not sell information it collects about End
Users. However, Adblade may share data about aggregate usage
statistics with the public or other businesses with whom we work. 
<br><br>The capture, storage and analysis of information are solely
for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience,
eliminating fraudulent activity, and system administration. <br><br><strong class="western">Adblade
Advertisers</strong>
<br><br>If an advertiser chooses to sign up as an advertiser on the
Adblade Premium Advertising Network, they are explicitly agreeing to
the use of information they provide as described below. The nature of
this technology means that advertisers who do not agree with this
policy cannot use the Adblade Premium Advertising Network,
advertising interface or measurement tools. The Terms and Conditions
that they agree to during registration allow Adblade to update the
terms of this privacy policy at any time and without notice. It is an
Advertiser's responsibility to review this privacy policy prior to
logging in. Use of Adblade is conditioned on your acceptance without
modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein.
Your use of the Adblade Premium Advertising Network constitutes your
agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices.
</p>
<p>
<br>Personal
information provided by an advertiser will be combined with
information about its purchasing patterns of Adblade's products and
services, performance of its advertisements, and all other
information provided by the advertiser. This information will be used
to, improve the relevancy of ad results and any other use deemed
helpful to the Adblade enterprise. Adblade regularly shares this
information with key partners on an individual basis. Furthermore,
Adblade and its partners may use this information to contact the
advertiser about additional products and services.
</p>
<p>
<br>An
advertiser has the right to terminate their relationship with Adblade
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
advertiser's contract with Adblade. However, all information captured
about the advertiser will remain the property of Adblade
indefinitely.<br><br><strong class="western">Organizations
We Work With</strong>
<br><br>Adblade provides access to organizations we work with on
Adblade's Premium Advertising Network to manage their own advertising
networks. Those relationships are managed under contracts between
Adblade and the respective partners. The campaign management tools
which Adblade provides to many of its partners allow each such
partner to view all relevant information of Adblade's advertisers
whose ads are being displayed on that partner's site. Such
information includes bidding data, spend data, topics and placements
viewed and purchased.<br><br>

    <strong class="western">Adblade Targeted Advertising and How to Opt-out</strong> <br><br>

We may, for example, use clickstream data to tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the site from which you linked to our site, how much time you spend on each page of our site, how you navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of our users.<br>
