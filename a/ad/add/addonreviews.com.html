<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolutely security.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>During installation, we will present you with Offers. You may choose not to accept our Offers. Your participation is voluntary, you are not required to disclose to our Partners any information they request. However, if you provide your Personally Identifiable Information in response to any Offer, we will share it with our Partners so they can provide you with the Offers in which you have expressed interest.</p>
<p><strong>Contacts/IP Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
<p>We offer free games. Some of our games collect your name as a requisite to setting up a profile. We use this information for the sole purpose of setting up your profile.</p>
<h3>Aggregate Information We Collect</h3>
<p>When you use our Services, we may collect tracking information such as your IP address, browser type, the type of operating system you use, details about your computer hardware, the applications you have installed on your PC, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages you visited on our Sites. None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. We and our Partners use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s help file.</p>
<p>We use cookies to: 1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers). We also use cookies to store your zip code and other information you have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local weather. We do not store Personally Identifiable Information in our cookies and we do not tie the information in our cookies to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information</p>
<p>Some of the Partner Offers on our Services may also use cookies. We have no control over our partners’ privacy policies. We also have no control over their cookies, the information collected and its use</p>
<p><strong>Web beacons or Pixels</strong></p>
<p>We and our Partners employ a software technology that helps us better manage content on our site. Web beacons or Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. They track your online Web movement. We embed Pixels invisibly on Web pages. They are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our partners’ Pixels. We also have no control over how they use information collected.</p>
<p><strong>Software Information</strong></p>
<p>We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer’s registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX, and Flash Player installed. We use your registry information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with software already present on your PC. We do not tie registry information gathered to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Information</strong></p>
<p>Your computer’s operating system also stores hardware information that we examine to determine your computer’s hardware configuration including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as well as the speed of your processor. We use the information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with your computer hardware. We do not tie hardware information to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>We also collect additional aggregate information when you install our Toolbars. For details on the information collected by the Search.us toolbar click here</p>
<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>We only use information as it is needed for each specific visit. We do not use your PII in any way at this point.</p>
<p><strong>E-mail Offers</strong></p>
<p>By providing your e-mail address, and choosing to receive our Offers, you agree to receive e-mails from us. Should you have any questions or concerns, or if you would like to discontinue receiving Offers, simply email us at webmaster@addonreviews.com. and ask us to remove you from our lists. You will only receive Offers via e-mail from us and our Partners if you have indicated that you would like to receive them.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>
<p>We post testimonials on our Sites. Testimonials may contain Personally Identifiable Information. We will obtain your consent via email prior to posting the testimonial or comment.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties and Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services in which, based on your Session Data, we or our business partners believe you may be interested. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative websitehttp://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.</p>
<p>When you click on a third party advertisers’ link from our Site, you will enter the third party’s site. We are not responsible for such third party’s sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.</p>
<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p>Partners may sponsor Offers or we may co-sponsor an Offer with a Partner through the software. You should always assume data collected when you fill-in an Offer will be shared with a Partner. If an Offer requires you to leave our websites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This Privacy Policy does not cover our partners’ websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your personal information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to be contacted by our partners you must contact that partner directly to opt-out.</p>
<p>Our Partners change from time to time, and therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. We strive to select trustworthy Partners who offer high quality products or services of interest to you. If you are unhappy with one of our Partners, tell us by e-mailing us at webmaster@addonreviews.com. or writing to us at AddOnReviews.com, 588 Sutter Street #551, San Francisco, CA 94102.</p>
<p>We may periodically use third parties to meet your needs. For example if you buy a game from us that may be handled by Real.com or one of our other game partners. If we hire a third-party service provider, they will be prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose not enumerated in this section.</p>
<p>The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:</p>
<p><strong>Search Partners&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or within one of our Software Offers) to search Partners, who use this information to provide us with search results, which we then will display to you.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Advertisements and Software&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you request or submit your information online to a Partner in response to any Offer, we transfer your information for each request made to that Partner.</p>
<p><strong>Our Products</strong></p>
<p>We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during the installation process of our Toolbars of other software products. However, when you use these Software Offers to access Download Offers (e.g. games) you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information. In addition, we will show you Offers during the installation process.</p>
<p><strong>E-Mail Suppression Lists</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose a user’s e-mail address as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to make sure that a user’s unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to ensure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law, including without limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer</strong></p>
<p>We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred assets.</p>
<p>From time to time we use third-parties when providing Services to you. We will only share information with third-parties necessary for them to provide the Services you have requested. Third-parties are prohibited from using your Personally Identifiable Information for promotional purposes.</p>
<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>By modifying your browser preferences, you can choose to, accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Offers</strong></p>
<p>We may from time to time, send you e-mail regarding third party promotions, as well as other, Products and Services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our Partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail or direct postal mail about other products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or postal mail from us, you can tell us by e-mailing us at privacy@addonreviews.com. You can also write to Attn: Customer Care, AddOnReviews.com, 588 Sutter Street #551, San Francisco CA 94102. Be sure to include your full name and address, along with the information you submitted during your initial registration including postal address and e-mail, and tell us that you no longer wish to receive Offers from us. You also have the option of unsubscribing from e-mail Offers by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every e-mail offer from us.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications</strong></p>
<p>For any of our sites you may edit your account information and user profile by using your username and password.</p>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you want your information deleted from our systems you should email our customer support team as support@addonreviews.com.</p>
<h3>Security and Passwords</h3>
<p>We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any information collected, transmitted over the Internet, or maintained in your user profile. You agree that any data transmission you make or receive through the Site or the Service is at your own risk.</p>
<p>No method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used, or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and guardians to be familiar with the web sites that their children visit the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulates the means by which web site operators collect and use personal information from children under 13, pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (the “Act”). For more information about the Act and children’s on-line privacy in general, visit the FTC’s web site at www.ftc.gov/privacy. For safety tips on privacy visitwww.OnGuardOnline.gov.</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
