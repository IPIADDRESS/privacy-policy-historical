      <p><b>1. Information Collection and Use</b></p>

      <p>add0n.com will not collect any personally identifiable information about You - such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address - unless You provide it to add0n.com voluntarily and approve its use.</p>

      <p>If You do not want Your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to add0n.com. When You do provide add0n.com with personally identifiable information, it may use that information to better understand Your needs and how it can improve its products and services. add0n.com may also use that information to contact You, for example, to answer a question or respond to a comment You have submitted. add0n.com reserves the right to display any questions or comments You submit, without reference to your identity, together with any responses add0n.com provides, on its frequently asked questions page found at http://add0n.com/faq.html. In the case of requests for new pages, add0n.com will use Your information to assess Your request, to verify Your identity and the identity of Your other project contributors, and for any other reasonable purposes in connection with Your request. However, it will not provide Your information to third parties without your consent, except as required by law as explained in the "Information Sharing" section below.</p>

      <p>In some cases, add0n.com may collect information that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser or computer operating system You use, the date and time You visited the Site, the pages You accessed, and the name of the web site from which You linked to the Site. add0n.com uses this information to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>

      <p><b>2. Information Collection and Use</b></p>

      <p>The Site hosts opt-in mailing lists and newsgroups for discussion about hosted projects and for general issues related to Browser application and extension development. Opt-in mailing lists may be found on the main site at http://add0n.com/mailing-lists.html and on the individual project pages. These mailing lists are bonded, which means they do not provide Your email address to third parties. If You have signed up for an opt-in mailing list and You later wish to opt-out, You may do this by following the instructions on the "mailing list" links on the relevant pages.</p>

      <p>When you sign up on a mailing list on the Site, you may be sent newsletters and other announcements of interest to add0n.com, depending on which mailing list you opt-in to. For a description of the non-project specific mailing lists available, please go to http://add0n.com/mailing-lists.html.</p>

      <p>You may have the opportunity to send an email to another user or mailing list, in which case Your valid email address and real name will be included in such messages. In order to prevent abuse, You may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from transmitting the email message.</p>

      <p>When participating in newsgroups or chat rooms, Your personal information may be publicly available through Your profile display, in which case You have the option to opt-out of publicly displaying Your real identity. Where site profiles allow users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at Your discretion and may be changed at any time by You.</p>

      <p>The Site is an open source site and the data and information hosted on the Site is publically accessible by design. Anonymous messages (or posts that have been edited to be made anonymous) are against the spirit of open source. When You offer content for other add0n.com users to read, attaching Your name to it gives other add0n.com users the ability to reply to You privately about it, in case they feel that a public reply would be inappropriate. If You want to avoid spam, use mail filters, or refrain from posting on the Site. add0n.com will not be responsible for any unsolicited email that You receive as a result of You posting Your email address on the newsgroups, chat rooms, or mailing lists.</p>

      <p>This privacy policy does not protect any information that You transmit to newsgroups, chat rooms, mailing lists or other users.</p>
