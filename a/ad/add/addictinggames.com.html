<h4>Developer Center</h4>
<p><strong>Jump to:</strong> <a href="#submitGame">Submit an Online&nbsp;Game</a><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Addicting Games&nbsp;Developer Community. As a member of the community, we ask that you cut your grass, refrain from burning things on Sundays and occasionally send us a game to feature. Addicting Games&nbsp;is the largest casual games site on any of the MANY Internets. At Addicting Games we work with a broad range of developers from across the world. How many developers, you ask? How does 1 million sound? Too high? Yeah, you're probably right. Realistically, it's in the thousands. But that's still a lot!</p>
<p>At Addicting Games, we enjoy building relationships with independent and professional game developers and have many ways to showcase, distribute and promote your game titles.</p>
<h6>Developer Sponsorship</h6>
<p>We want to get the best oringal games in front of as many players as possible, on as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to get a game sponsored by Addicting Games, ask yourself if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is it original?</strong><br>
<br>
Does your game feature some new game mechanic or twist on gameplay? If not, are you at least doing it better than similar games? We look for creativity and most of all fun!&nbsp;Fun doesn't need to be polished and perfect, fun can be a half-done work in progress that has everyone playing for hours.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it a good fit for AddictingGames.com?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are&nbsp;a lot of great games that simply aren't right for our audience. Check out some of our games to get a feel for our brand. We want games that can be enjoyed by everyone, many of our players are playing from work and schools so we try not to get people fired / suspended for having little downtime playing games.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it mobile-ready?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Can you easily convert the game for mobile platforms? If not, it's not a deal-breaker. But if you can, well that's like asking whether we want a tasty doughnut or a tasty doughnut with a jetpack attached to it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it addictive errrr ADDICTING?</strong><br>
<br>
Does it have that je ne sais quoi? If not, does it speak French and could it tell us what je ne sais quoi means? On the level (pun!), some of the most addicting, replayable games are the simplest. We can't pick up every game we like or every game that's kind of fun. Does your game stand out above the rest?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Please read the following instructions carefully and if you have any questions&nbsp;please feel free to contact us.</span></p>

User Material is also considered a "Posting", as such term defined in the <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/terms-use.jsp"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a>, and therefore, all terms and conditions contained within the section of the <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/terms-use.jsp"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a> "Postings" shall apply to all User Material you submit or create on the Site pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for Posting to the Site.

<p>Welcome to the Addicting Games&nbsp;Developer Community. As a member of the community, we ask that you cut your grass, refrain from burning things on Sundays and occasionally send us a game to feature. Addicting Games&nbsp;is the largest casual games site on any of the MANY Internets. At Addicting Games we work with a broad range of developers from across the world. How many developers, you ask? How does 1 million sound? Too high? Yeah, you're probably right. Realistically, it's in the thousands. But that's still a lot!</p>
<p>At Addicting Games, we enjoy building relationships with independent and professional game developers and have many ways to showcase, distribute and promote your game titles.</p>
<h6>Developer Sponsorship</h6>
<p>We want to get the best oringal games in front of as many players as possible, on as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to get a game sponsored by Addicting Games, ask yourself if it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is it original?</strong><br>
<br>
Does your game feature some new game mechanic or twist on gameplay? If not, are you at least doing it better than similar games? We look for creativity and most of all fun!&nbsp;Fun doesn't need to be polished and perfect, fun can be a half-done work in progress that has everyone playing for hours.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it a good fit for AddictingGames.com?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are&nbsp;a lot of great games that simply aren't right for our audience. Check out some of our games to get a feel for our brand. We want games that can be enjoyed by everyone, many of our players are playing from work and schools so we try not to get people fired / suspended for having little downtime playing games.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it mobile-ready?</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Can you easily convert the game for mobile platforms? If not, it's not a deal-breaker. But if you can, well that's like asking whether we want a tasty doughnut or a tasty doughnut with a jetpack attached to it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Is it addictive errrr ADDICTING?</strong><br>
<br>
Does it have that je ne sais quoi? If not, does it speak French and could it tell us what je ne sais quoi means? On the level (pun!), some of the most addicting, replayable games are the simplest. We can't pick up every game we like or every game that's kind of fun. Does your game stand out above the rest?</li>

User Material is also considered a "Posting", as such term defined in the <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/terms-use.jsp"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a>, and therefore, all terms and conditions contained within the section of the <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/legal/terms-use.jsp"><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></a> "Postings" shall apply to all User Material you submit or create on the Site pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for Posting to the Site.

<p>To educate our users and their adult supervisors on games they may not find appropriate, AddictingGames provides a Game Rating System to assist users in identifying appropriate games given their maturity level. Below are the details of our rating system. Our goal is to help everyone find the games they like to play, so use our rating system as a guide to help you find the best games on the site for you!</p>

<h2>Game Rating System</h2>
<p>We want everyone to have a fun and enjoyable experience at AddictingGames, the largest source of the best free online games including funny games, flash games, arcade games, dress-up games, internet games, shooting games, word games, RPG games, racing games, and much more. Many of our games are appropriate for users of all ages, but some of the games contain mature themes and/or mild violence and are primarily intended for teenagers and young adults. Because everyone can play for free and no registration is required, it is important that adults have the opportunity to understand the site and identify which games are appropriate for their particular household. To educate our users and their adult supervisors on games they may not find appropriate, AddictingGames provides a Game Rating System to assist users in identifying appropriate games given their maturity level. In addition, games with mature themes and moderate violence are flagged with a bomb icon <span class="bombSmall"> </span>. Adults supervising young people that visit AddictingGames should discuss whether games with a bomb icon are appropriate for the user to play given the maturity level of the user.

<p class="sectionHeading">Other Tips for Adults reviewing the site for use by Minors:</p>
<ul class="plainList" id="ulw">
<li>Consider the user's unique personality and level of maturity. Every young person is different, and adults should use their judgment in deciding which games are appropriate for young people in their care.</li>
<li>As with any site, watch what games minors are playing and talk to them about the games.</li>
<li>Try playing the games yourself! You'll have fun and be able to provide better guidance for your young person.</li>
<li>If you cannot supervise a user's play on the site, and are not comfortable with the young person visiting AddictingGames on his or her own, you may want to consider blocking the site by using commercially available parental control software.</li>
