information is protected.</p>

  privacy is important to us, and we recognize the need to provide additional privacy
  protection for children on the Nickelodeon Sites permitting such visitors.&nbsp; Our

  <p class="justify"><a class="no-hover" id="I"><strong>I.</strong><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.</strong></a></p>
  <p class="justify">We may request or
  collect certain information when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites. However, visitors are
  required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in
  the particular activity.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_A"><strong> A.&nbsp;
  Registration Information</strong></a>:&nbsp; The information required to register varies by
  Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip
  code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and
  (i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences,
  and interests. If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual
  knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child may be asked to provide his or her
  parent's or guardian's email address. For certain countries, visitors or their parents/guardians
  will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to
  the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the
  account; accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="justify">Registration information
  is used to enable visitors to take advantage of site offerings; respond to
  visitor’s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; serve
  appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon
  Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the
  “Viacom family of companies” (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and
  its subsidiaries and affiliates, including but not limited to Atom Entertainment, Inc.), as well as on behalf of selected third parties
offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_B"><strong>B. Social Platform
  Registrations and Social Media Plugins</strong></a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or
  require users who are at least 13 years old to register or log into their account via a social networking platform such
  as Login with Facebook or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the
  Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons. When you use these
  social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services
  and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may
  be shared with us.</p>
  <p class="justify">When you use social
  networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their
  privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In
  addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on
  the Nickelodeon Sites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking
  platform about your use of the Nickelodeon Sites. Such services may also employ unique
  identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for
  purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you. For more information about
  Login with Facebook, please go <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=730" target="_blank">here</a>. For more information on Flux, please go
  <a href="http://www.socialproject.com/UserAgreements/enUS/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that
  their privacy policies may be different from our own and we encourage you to read
  them.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_C"><strong>C.&nbsp;Computer
  Information Collected by Us</strong></a>:&nbsp; When visitors come to a Site, we may automatically
  collect certain information from their computers or mobile devices, such as the type of
  computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the visitor's IP address, the
  web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Firefox), UDID (for certain mobile
  devices), information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site,
  the web pages and advertisements viewed and links clicked on within the Nickelodeon
  Sites, interactions with e-mail messages sent by a Site or the Viacom family of
  companies (<em>e.g.</em>, links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or
  forwarded), information collected through the use of unique identifiers such as cookies
  (see below), information regarding the Internet service provider, and other standard
  server log information ("Computer Information").</p>
  <p class="justify">We may use cookies, web
  beacons, tokens or similar technologies (collectively referred to as “Tracking
  Technologies”) on the Nickelodeon Sites. "Cookies" (which may be html files,
  Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and
  activity.&nbsp;“Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs)
  are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views,
  promotion views or advertising responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Tokens” are unique 
  persistent identifiers that are generated and sent from a server, such as Adobeâs Pass 
  service, to a userâs device to identify an interaction session, such as the authentication 
  for a userâs cable provider service, and which are usually stored as an HTTP cookie.  
  The Site and/or third parties may use Tracking Technologies to collect Computer
  Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.</p>
  <p class="justify">We may use Tracking
  Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between certain
  Nickelodeon Sites without logging into each Site, enable the internal functioning of
  the Nickelodeon Sites, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the
  content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on the
  Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand
  your interactions with email messages originating from the Nickelodeon Sites or the
  Viacom family of companies (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were
  opened or forwarded), save your password, save your online game or video player
  settings, enable you to use shopping carts, help us offer you products, programs or
  services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and
  administer the&nbsp;Nickelodeon Sites.&nbsp; These Tracking Technologies collect
  “click stream” data and additional other information regarding your visits
  to the Nickelodeon Sites (such as your visits to specific webpages, use of features,
  purchasing history or preferences), may collect such other information across multiple
  sessions on the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites offered by the Viacom family of
  companies and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the
  device you use to access the site (“Identifier”). An Identifier may be
  automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. When a 
  cable television service subscriber authenticates his cable television service to view 
  full episodes of Nickelodeon programing in the Nick mobile app, a third party token is 
  stored on the userâs mobile device so that the subscriber can view Nickelodeon television 
  episodes in the future without having to re-authenticate his cable service subscription.</p>
  <p class="justify">By visiting a Site,
  whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree
  that you are giving us your consent to set and access Cookies on  your device and track your activities and your use of a Site
  through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking
  Technologies in the emails we send to you.</p>
  <p class="justify">The Nickelodeon Sites
  adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. <a href="http://srp.mtvn.com/sitefaq.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information about the
  Nickelodeon Sites and online behavioral advertising. Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target 
  advertising to children under 13 on sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon 
has actual knowledge that a user is under 13.</p>
  <p class="justify">Our Third Party
  Advertising Service Providers (as defined in Section D) do not have access to Tracking
  Technologies set by the Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide
  services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as
  advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your
  Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for
  Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to
  other information about you.</p>

  Information Collected By Others</strong></a>: The Nickelodeon Group uses the services of third parties who may collect, use or disclose cookie information, IP addresses or other identifiers from devices and/or browsers of users who visit Nickelodeon Sites. For a list of these third parties on Nickelodeon Sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13, please go <a href="http://www.nick.com/nick-assets/copy/third-parties.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party
  advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing
  analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively,
  “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve
  advertisements on the Nickelodeon Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and
  measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Nickelodeon Sites
  (“Targeting Services”). These Targeting Services enable us to display
  advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you
  have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products
  and services that may interest you. Targeting Services also help prevent you from
  seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain
  advertisements. Nickelodeon does not behaviorally target advertising to children under 
  13 on sites that are directed to children or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge 
  that a user is under 13.</p>
  <p class="justify">These Third Party
  Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the
  Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Nickelodeon
  Sites. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may
  themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose
  to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you
  have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about
  you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log
  data separately and independently from what the Nickelodeon Sites collect.</p>
  <p class="justify">You should be aware that
  different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by
  third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites
  you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is
  within their control and not the Nickelodeon Sites. Even if we have a relationship with
  the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices
  regarding your information and those sites may use the information they collect from you 
  consistent with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We encourage 
  you to research and direct any
  of your questions in this regard to these third parties.</p>
  <p class="justify">With respect to the
  Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>You can opt-out of the use of
      information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party Advertising

<p>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</p>  

<p>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as set forth above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described above in Section I(C).
</p>
  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_E"><strong>E.&nbsp;Contests and
  Sweepstakes</strong></a>:&nbsp; The Nickelodeon Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes.
  To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name
  and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the
  contest or sweepstakes.&nbsp; On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or
  where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the
  child’s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store
  such child’s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for
  notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests or sweepstakes on such
  sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the
  parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the
  option to have the child's entry deleted.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em"><a class="no-hover" id="I_F"><strong>F.&nbsp;
  Electronic Postcards and Messages</strong></a>: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the
  opportunity to send electronic postcards and “wish lists” of items they
  want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor’s behalf,
  email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email
  address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Visitors must only provide  email addresses of people who they know would be happy to receive such  electronic postcards or email messages. Email
  addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested
  postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message
  is sent.&nbsp; In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (<em>e.g.</em>, points
  to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's
  family or friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal
  requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain
  regions or countries.</p>

  <p class="justify" style="text-indent:4em">
  <a class="no-hover" id="I_G"><strong>G.&nbsp;Electronic Newsletters</strong></a>: Visitors can provide their email addresses to
  receive email newsletters and promotions from the Nickelodeon Group, the Viacom family
  of companies, and our business partners.&nbsp; Visitors may change their preferences
  regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for
  certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their
account.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="justify">When visitors to
  Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual
  knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old ask to receive our email
  newsletter(s), they&nbsp;will be asked to provide their first name, email address and
  the email address of their parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a
  notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the
  newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or
  her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the
  child’s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent,
  but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian
  may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the
  "unsubscribe" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.&nbsp;
  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information
  collected online about their child. See section V (B) below. When a child provides a
  parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address
  is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our
  system.</p>

  Features and Services</strong></a>: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites offer interactive features and
  services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes,
  messaging services, and member profile pages. For certain countries, on Nickelodeon
  Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a
  user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the
  child’s parent/guardian before allowing the child to use these interactive features and
  services or will use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all
  personal information from a child’s postings before they are made public and also
  delete such information from our records. We use the information collected through
  interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and
  services.</p>

  Services</strong></a>: Consistent with local law, appropriately aged visitors may have the
  opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and
  information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices. To do so, visitors
  may be asked to provide their telephone number, email address, carrier’s
  name, and/or their opinion regarding certain goods and/or services. Visitors must opt
  in to receive wireless marketing material from businesses within the Nickelodeon Group
  and Viacom family of companies through one of the following methods: (a) filling out
  the registration information on any Nickelodeon Sites’ wireless marketing
  registration page; or (b) sending a specific word, code or symbol via a text message to
  a telephone number designated by us in any promotional material. The visitor may also
  be asked to confirm his or her acceptance to receive such wireless marketing
  services.</p>

  <p class="justify">Visitors that register
  for wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be
  charged by the visitor's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the visitor from the
  Nickelodeon Sites or Viacom family of companies. Standard messaging rates will apply,
  unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Nickelodeon Group or the Viacom
  family of companies be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges
  incurred by such visitor or by a person that has access to a visitor's wireless device,
  telephone number, or email address.</p>

  only if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location
  information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device

  visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the Viacom family of

  <p class="justify">The
  Nickelodeon Sites maintain reasonable technical and organizational steps to help ensure
  that information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have
  physical access to our database servers and use of electronic security systems and
  password protections which guard against unauthorized access. The Nickelodeon Sites
  conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions. We limit access to
  visitor’s information to employees and contractors who are authorized for the
  proper handling of such information, and any employee found violating our standards of
  security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We also
  take reasonable steps to help make sure our third-party agents protect the security of
  your personal information. However, as with most Internet sites or services, it is
  possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a
  number of means despite our efforts.</p>
  <p class="justify">Information
  collected at the Nickelodeon Sites will not be stored for longer than is necessary for
  the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to otherwise meet legal
  requirements.</p>

  exceptions.&nbsp; To do so, you should log into your account or you may e-mail us
  at <a href="mailto:nickprivacy@nickonline.com">nickprivacy@nickonline.com</a>.&nbsp; To help

  <p class="justify">Parents/guardians of
  children under the age of 13 can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows
  them to review any personally identifiable information collected about their child,
  have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or
  use of their child's personally identifiable information. You can
  download the form <a href="http://www.nick.com/info/personal-information-access.html" target="_blank">here</a>. We will take steps to verify the identity of
  anyone requesting personally identifiable information about a child and to ensure that
  the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.</p>

  <a class="no-hover" id="V_C"><strong>C.&nbsp;Termination of Wireless Services</strong></a></p>
  <p class="justify">You may cancel one or
  more wireless services via your wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe
  mechanism provided by the Nickelodeon Sites at the time the message is sent, or by
  sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or
  "QUIT". Nickelodeon Sites will terminate your registration for the most recent wireless
  service you received. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's
  termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with the
  Nickelodeon Sites. If you unsubscribe from one or all of wireless service(s) via your
  wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel your
  previous opt-in.</p>

  Sites offer you and your child an online safety guide which we encourage you to use as
  starting point for discussing safety and privacy concerns with your child. Of course,
  involvement in your family’s online lives is the most important safety tool
  available. Some of the various guides are available here: </p>
