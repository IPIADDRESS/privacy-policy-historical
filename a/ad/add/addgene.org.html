	<p><b>Our Privacy Policy has changed. Please review the updated policy before making further use of our website and/or services.</b></p>

<p><i><b>Last modified: May 23, 2013</b></i></p>

<p>Addgene, Inc. values your trust and understands your concerns of how your information is used and shared. This statement describes the policies and practices we have designed and implemented to protect your privacy. The statement does not apply to the policies and practices of companies that Addgene does not own or control, or to individuals that are not under Addgene’s actual control.</p>


	<h3>Information Collection</h3>

	<p>We collect and store any personal information that you provide us through our website, communications, or certain other ways. Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date, and other personally identifiable information. </p>

	<p>Additionally, some of our web pages automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and track website usage, which we may occasionally aggregate with similar information from other visitors. Such information may include Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (“IP”) addresses; browser software and operating system types; dates and times; frequency and length of page visits; and site navigation. This information helps us evaluate our visitors’ experiences and improve our website.</p>

	<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>

	<p>We collect personal information so we can communicate with you as described below. However, you may opt-out of or unsubscribe to these communications. Please see our Choice/Opt-out section below.</p>

	<p><i>Customer Service.</i> We may need to contact you in regards to an order or a deposit. We may also need to communicate with your regularly to provide requested services and to handle any issues relating to your account. Upon initial contact, we will reply via email or phone in accordance with your wishes.</p>

	<p><i>Newsletter, Special Offers, and Updates.</i> If you wish to subscribe to our notification emails, which will allow you to receive automatic emails notifying you when a certain type of plasmid is available, and/or newsletter, we will ask for your contact information. Out of respect for your privacy, you may opt-out of these communications at any time. Please see the Choice/Opt-out section.</p>

<p><i>Service Announcements.</i> On rare occasions it may be necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send you a notification via email.</p>

	<h3>Sharing Information</h3>

	<p>We appreciate that you trust us to handle your personal information with care. Your trust is an important part of our business. Accordingly, we do not sell, rent, lease or trade your personal information to others. To the extent that we share any personal information, we do so as described below.</p>

	<p><i>Compliance.</i> We may need to disclose your personal information to law enforcement, government agencies, and/or officials, or other third parties in order to comply with legal proceedings, court orders, applicable laws and regulations, or other obligations that would, if unmet, would expose us to legal liability. Additionally, some of our deposited materials are subject to special disclosure requirements, which may require third party disclosures. If you purchase certain materials, we may have to share your personal information with the associated depositor.</p>

	<p><i>Institutions/Employers.</i> We typically receive plasmids from academic and research institutions. We may be required by such institutions to disclose certain personal information about those requesting plasmids. Such disclosures will be limited to the source institution for each plasmid request.</p>

	<p><i>Shipping and Billing.</i> We use an outside shipping company to ship orders and a credit card processing company to bill customers for goods and services. These companies should not be retaining, sharing, storing or using personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

	<p><i>Third Party Services.</i> We may, from time to time, also allow other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. This may include analyzing customer lists and data and providing marketing assistance. Any access to personal information will be limited to the extent needed to perform the employed function. The information will not be used for any other purpose, and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third party service providers are obligated to protect any disclosed personal information on our behalf.</p>

	<p><i>Business Transitions.</i> In the event of a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, consolidation, change in control, reorganization, liquidation or selling a portion of our assets, we may transfer, sell or assign information concerning your use of this site, including without limitation, your personal information that you provide and other information concerning your use of the site, to such acquiring company. You will be notified via email and prominent notice on our site for thirty (30) days prior to a change of ownership or control of your personal information. If as a result of the business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be given choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section below.</p>


	<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>

	<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to “unsubscribe” in the subject line in the email or contacting the Customer Care Team at the contact information below in the manner most convenient for you.</p>

	<h3>Consent</h3>

	<p>You will be notified if and when your information is being collected by any outside parties, other than those mentioned in our Privacy Policy. We do this so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not you should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>

	<h3>Links</h3>

	<p>This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.</p>

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>We take every normal precaution to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via our website or other communication, your information is protected both online and off-line. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website. That is why you enter your unique User Name and Password each time you access your account. </p>

	<p>After placing an order with us, your payment information, such as full credit card or purchase order number, is no longer available on our website. Even users with your password cannot access this information.</p>


	<p>When our registration form asks you to enter non-public information, that information is encrypted and protected with the Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) protocol, a leading encryption technology. While you are on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, activates, as opposed to unlocking or opening, when “surfing”. SSL works like this: information that you enter becomes a string of unrecognizable numbers before entering the Internet. When your encrypted data reaches Addgene, its server decodes the information and stores it in its database. Both our server and your Internet browser understand the mathematical formulas used to turn your personal data into numeric code and back again. Therefore, every time you enter information and every time saved information is accessed from our database, the information is encrypted before it travels onto the Internet. Each time you log on to our website, our server and your Internet browser agree on a random number (“customer session I.D.”), which serves as the “decoding key” while you are logged into our website. The random number generated depends on the level of encryption your browser supports.</p>

	<p>When Addgene’s registration form asks customers to enter non-public information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure Sockets Layer (<span class="caps">SSL</span>) protocol, the leading encryption technology. While customers are on a secure page, such as Addgene’s registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers, such as Netscape navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes activated, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when “surfing”. <span class="caps">SSL</span> works like this: information that customers enter becomes a string of unrecognizable numbers before entering the Internet. When customers’ encrypted data reaches Addgene, its server decodes the information and stores it in its database. Both Addgene’s server and the browser customers use to navigate the Web understand the mathematical formulas used to turn customers’ personal data into numeric code and then back again. So every time customers enter information and every time saved information is accessed from Addgene’s database, it gets encrypted before it travels onto the Internet. Each time customers log on to the Addgene site, its server and customers’ Web browser agree on a random number (customer session I.D.) which serves as the “decoding key” while customers are logged into the site. What that random number could be depends on the level of encryption customers’ browser supports.</p>

	<h3>Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

	<p>We may, from time to time, choose to change our Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted to this page. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice, which may include notifications on our homepages, through email, and/or other places we deem appropriate. We want you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

	<p>If, however, we were going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner not discussed or contemplated above, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. However, if you have opted out of all communications from us, or deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, and your personal information will be not used in this new manner.</p>

	<h3>Contact Information</h3>
