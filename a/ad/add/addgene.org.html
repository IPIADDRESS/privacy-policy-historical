            <p>With regards to Personal Information collected during account creation, Addgene needs that information because it is necessary:</p>

                <li><p>to comply with legal obligations to which Addgene is subject, including our inability to ship to certain countries, entities and individuals pursuant to U.S. export control regulations; our inability to distribute materials to industry organizations pursuant to our contractual obligations; and our obligation to track, record and report material distributions to the applicable material rights holders; and</p></li>
                <li><p>to perform / carry out our mission as a nonprofit repository that helps scientists around the world by, amongst other things, serving as an archive for their scientific research materials, data, protocols and other research information.</p></li>

            <p>As noted above, for security purposes, Addgene does not process nor store your credit card information. It never touches our servers and so is never seen by us. <a href="https://usaepay.info/about/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span> Visit USAePay’s page</a> for more information about service and security.</p>
            <p><u>Assuming that you have placed your order directly on Addgene’s website</u>, Addgene can use your purchase order number to look up your order if/when you contact us. We will also use it to recoup payment from your organization.</p>
            <p>Once we have payment assurance, this information is then processed through our financial accounting software, Celigo and Netsuite.</p>

    <p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously. Our website protects your personal information during transfer using encryption technologies such as Transport Level Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). After transfer, your personal information is stored in a secure database with limited access. Addgene uses the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud to host our website and databases. AWS’ highly secure data centers provide multiple levels of security assurances. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span> To learn more about AWS cloud security, please click here.</a></p>
    <p>After placing an order with us, your payment information, such as full credit card number or purchase order number, is no longer available on our website. Even users with your password cannot access this information.</p>

    <h2>What controls do Addgene’s users have in that information?</h2>
