            <p align="left">This privacy policy (the “Policy”) discloses our privacy
                practices for http://www.PlayStream.com (the “<b>PlayStream
                Site</b>”), http://www.AddWebVideo.com (the “<b>AddWebVideo
                Site</b>”), http://www.DigitalRightsMedia.com (the “<b>DigitalRightsMedia
                Site</b>”), http://www.GoSmil.com (the “<b>GoSmil
                Site</b>”),
                and http://www.StreamingCalculator.com (the “<b>StreamingCalculator
                Site</b>”). This Policy refers to these five Sites collectively
              as “our Sites.”</p>
            <p align="center"><b>I. The Information We Collect, And How We Use It</b></p>
            <p>PlayStream, LLC, is the sole owner of the information
              collected on our Sites. PlayStream collects different kinds of
              information
                  from our users on our Sites, and we use that information in
              various ways, as explained below.</p>
            <p><b>A. <u>The PlayStream Site</u></b></p>
            <p><b>1. PlayStream Newsletter</b></p>
            <p>We provide a low-volume email newsletter (currently averaging
                      one to two news announcements per month) to provide general
                      news about
                      PlayStream’s new services, upgrades, and general information
                      about our Sites and our services. There is an online field on PlayStream’s
                      home page that you can use to enter your email address in order
                      to subscribe to the newsletter. You can also subscribe or unsubscribe
                      to the Newsletter when you sign up for an Evaluation Account
                      or place an Order for Service (as described below). You do this
                      by
                      checking a box on the relevant Evaluation Account or Order for
              Service order page.</p>
            <p>When you subscribe to the newsletter, we use your email
                      address to provide the newsletter to you via email. With
                      each newsletter
                      we provide a method to unsubscribe from the newsletter,
                      with a link to the Web page where you can enter your request
                      to
                      unsubscribe. You may also contact PlayStream directly as
                      described at the
                      end
              of this Policy regarding unsubscribing from the newsletter.</p>
            <p><b>2. Evaluation Account</b></p>
            <p>PlayStream provides a 15-day free evaluation of our service,
                        subject to PlayStream’s Terms and Conditions of
                        service. When you sign up for an Evaluation Account by
                        filling out our
                        online form,
                        you are required to provide information that includes
                        contact information (such as name and email address).
                        We may, at times,
                        also ask you
                        to provide demographic information (such as income level
                        and gender) or answers to survey questions (such as how
                        you heard
                        about PlayStream)
                        during this process. We do not collect credit card or
                        financial information when you sign up for an Evaluation
                        Account. We use contact information to communicate with
                        you about
                        your Evaluation Account. We use demographic information
                        you provide
                        and your answers
                        to surveys to improve our Sites and services we offer,
              and for any other purposes described in the surveys.</p>
            <p><b>3. Order For Service</b></p>
            <p>When you want to sign up for PlayStream’s services (for
                          more than the 15-day free period of an Evaluation Account), you
                          can
                          do so as an upgrade from an Evaluation Account or without having
                          had an Evaluation Account at all. To sign up, you fill out the
                          online Order For Service form, and in the process you are required
                          to provide contact information (like name and shipping address)
                          and financial information (credit card number, expiration date)
                          on our order form. We use this information to communicate with
                          you about your account, for billing purposes (including collection
                          purposes, if necessary), and to fulfill your orders. If we have
                          trouble processing an order, we use this contact information
              to get in touch with you.</p>
            <p><b>4. Request For Proposal</b></p>
            <p>Before or after you place an Order for Service, you
                            may request information about additional services
                  by completing
                            PlayStream’s
                            online Request for Proposal. During this process, you are required
                            to provide your contact information (such as name and email address)
                            and information about the services you request. We use this information
                            to communicate with you about your request and about the services
                            on the PlayStream Site in which you have expressed interest,
              and to consider the nature of those requested services.</p>
            <p>We may, at times, also ask you to provide demographic
                            information (such as company location, and company
                            type). While you
                            are not required to provide this demographic information
                            in order
                            to
                            use the services that are the subject of your Request
                            for Proposal, we encourage you to do so to allow
                            us to provide
                            a more personalized
              experience on the PlayStream Site.</p>
            <p><b>5. PlayStream Members' Web site</b></p>
            <p>Unless we indicate otherwise, you become an “Active Customer” on
                              the Effective Start Date of the service you sign up for from
                              the PlayStream Site (including under an Evaluation Account),
                              and after
                              that you remain an Active Customer until the Effective End Date
                              of that service. As an Active Customer, you can manage certain
                              aspects of your account (e.g., personal identification information,
                              account records, media content, and various reports) by logging
                              into the PlayStream Web site. To access the members' area of
                              PlayStream's Web site, you must enter your unique user name and
                              your password.
                We use that information to log you in to PlayStream's Web site.</p>
            <p><b>6. Site and Service Updates</b></p>
            <p>We use contact information from Active Customers
                                to send them periodic Site and Service Updates,
                                which contain
                                important information about
                                using the services on the PlayStream Site, including
                                account billing and collections and technical

                  your web browser.
                                    There are two

                                    you would need to reenter your password to enter each page on
                                    the PlayStream Site requiring password access, or you might not
                                    be

                                      in order to avoid asking you for your password (if any) with

                                      cookies.) Session cookies are deleted when your session on the
