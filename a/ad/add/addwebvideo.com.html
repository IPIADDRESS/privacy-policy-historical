              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We provide a low-volume 
                email newsletter (currently averaging one to two news announcements 
                per month) to provide general news about PlayStream’s new services, 
                upgrades, and general information about our Sites and our services.&nbsp; 
                There is an online field on PlayStream’s home page that you can 
                use to enter your email address in order to subscribe to the newsletter.&nbsp; 
                You can also subscribe or unsubscribe to the Newsletter when you 
                sign up for an Evaluation Account or place an Order for Service 
                (as described below).&nbsp; You do this by checking a box on the relevant 
                Evaluation Account or Order for Service order page.&nbsp; </font></p>

                Terms and Conditions of service.&nbsp; When you sign up for an Evaluation 
                Account by filling out our online form, you are required to provide 
                information that includes contact information (such as name and 
                email address).&nbsp; We may, at times, also ask you to provide demographic 
                information (such as income level and gender) or answers to survey 
                questions (such as how you heard about PlayStream) during this

                up for PlayStream’s services (for more than the 15-day free period 
                of an Evaluation Account), you can do so as an upgrade from an 
                Evaluation Account or without having had an Evaluation Account 
                at all.&nbsp; To sign up, you fill out the online Order For Service 
                form, and in the process you are required to provide contact information 
                (like name and shipping address) and financial information (credit 
                card number, expiration date) on our order form. We use this information 
                to communicate with you about your account, for billing purposes 
                (including collection purposes, if necessary), and to fulfill 
                your orders.&nbsp; If we have trouble processing an order, we use this

                place an Order for Service, you may request information about 
                additional services by completing PlayStream’s online Request 
                for Proposal.&nbsp; During this process, you are required to provide 
                your contact information (such as name and email address) and 
                information about the services you request.&nbsp; We use this information 
                to communicate with you about your request and about the services 
                on the PlayStream Site in which you have expressed interest, and 
                to consider the nature of those requested services.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We may, at times, 
                also ask you to provide demographic information (such as company 
                location, company type and age).&nbsp; While you are not required to 
                provide this demographic information in order to use the services 
                that are the subject of your Request for Proposal, we encourage 
                you to do so to allow us to provide a more personalized experience

                remain an Active Customer until the Effective End Date of that 
                service.&nbsp; As an Active Customer, you can manage certain aspects 
                of your account (e.g., personal identification information, account 
                records, media content, and various reports) by logging into the

                from Active Customers to send them periodic Site and Service Updates,

                the PlayStream Site, including account billing and collections 
                and technical support.&nbsp; We provide Site and Service Updates primarily 
                through email, but we may do so sometimes by postal mail or phone.&nbsp; 
                You may request to stop receiving Site and Service Updates by 
                contacting PlayStream directly as described at the end of this 
                Policy.&nbsp; We recommend against Active Customers unsubscribing from 
                Site and Service Updates because of their importance.&nbsp; If you 
                do unsubscribe to Site and Service Updates, you waive any right 
                to receive notifications of any modifications or changes to the 
                PlayStream Site, to our services, or to our policies.&nbsp; (However,
