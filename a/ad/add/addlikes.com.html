If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.&nbsp;<strong>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</strong></span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>As you visit and browse our Website, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web serverâ€™s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong><br>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Googleâ€™s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (â€interest based targetingâ€). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses â€œnon personally identifiable informationâ€. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong><br>We&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identifies a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</span></p><p style=""><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual address.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br></strong>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong><br>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Website or the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including websites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web siteâ€™s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>By using our Website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</span></p><p style=""><em><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></em></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out<br></strong>This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</span></p><p style=""><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">From time-to-time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user, therefore, has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</span></p><p style=""><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">A Special Note About Children</strong></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</span></p><p style=""><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">In the event that the website (or a substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</span></p><p style=""><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><strong style="">Policy Modifications<br></strong>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</span></p></div><p></p>
