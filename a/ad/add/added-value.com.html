    <p>We, Kantar Added Value Limited, are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy relates to our website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.added-value.com/">www.added-value.com</a>, our mobile applications and any of our other online or mobile products, content and services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we use any personal information that we collect about you when you use the Service.&nbsp; Further details of how we use your information are set out in our&nbsp;<a href="http://added-value.com/cookies-policy/">Cookies Policy</a> and in each additional privacy and/or cookies policy for any particular part of the Service, each of which forms part of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you consent to the collection, storage and use of your personal information as described below. &nbsp;If&nbsp;you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service and (if&nbsp;relevant) please uninstall the related application.</p>

<p><strong>Data protection compliance</strong></p>
<p>The Service is controlled by us from our offices in the United Kingdom (“<strong>UK</strong>”). Personal information collected from the Service is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “<strong>Act</strong>”), which regulates the processing of personal data in the UK.&nbsp; We are registered as a data controller in&nbsp;accordance with the Act and comply with UK data protection and privacy law, together with the Market Research Society’s guidance on data protection compliance.</p>
<p>If you choose to use the Service from outside the UK, you do so at your own risk, with the understanding that personal information collected from the Service may be collected, stored and used in a country whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home country.</p>
<p><strong>The information we collect from you</strong></p>
<p>When you use the Service (such as when subscribing to our newsletter), you may be asked to provide personal information that identifies you personally (including “personal data” and “sensitive personal data”, as defined in the Act). &nbsp;This may include your name, email address, postal address and country of residence (and, where relevant, your company and job title). &nbsp;From time to time, you may be asked to submit personal information in order to receive or use parts of the Service or for the purposes further described in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable us to provide you with the products, content or services you select. If you do not provide us with all or part of the personal information requested, some parts of the Service may not be available to you.</p>
<p>Whenever you provide such personal information (whether to us direct or to others collecting it on our behalf) or we receive it with your permission from third parties (such as social network operators), we&nbsp;will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You may decide to make certain information available for other users of the Service to see (for&nbsp;example, where commenting on a blog post).&nbsp; In this context, you should only provide information that you are entirely comfortable with providing, and we strongly recommend that you do not provide any details that could be used to make personal contact with you.</p>
<p>We may also collect certain anonymous usage data, such as pages visited and services used within the Service. &nbsp;This information is not personally identifiable information and generally is not aggregated with your personal information. &nbsp;If it is aggregated with personal information in a way that makes you personally identifiable, we will treat the aggregated information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;We generally use usage data to improve our services to you and to customize and enhance your experience of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>An important note to parents or guardians</strong></p>
<p>We encourage parents or guardians to take an active interest in their children’s use of online or mobile platforms, including the Service. &nbsp;Their involvement is essential to help ensure a safe and rewarding experience for their children. &nbsp;Parents or guardians should be aware that there are software tools available that screen objectionable content and allow you to prevent children from disclosing their personal information without your permission.</p>
<p>We will not intentionally collect any personal information from children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 can participate in all activities on the Service that do not require submission of personal information. &nbsp;They may view, but may not under any circumstances participate in activities that require submission of personal information, such as message boards, contests or sweepstakes.</p>
<p>In addition we take particular care when processing the personal information of children aged 16 or older to ensure that such information is processed in accordance with the Act.</p>
