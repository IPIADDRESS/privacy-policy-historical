        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to the Addition
            Elle website (the “Site”). At Addition Elle, 
          we value our customers and respect your privacy. We collect information
            in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate
            with you about our products, services, contests and special promotions.
            Addition Elle recognizes that it must maintain and use your personal
            information responsibly. We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate
            our firm commitment to your privacy and security, and to advise you
            about the possible uses we will make of personal information collected
            during your visit to our Site. <br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What Information is Collected on our Website</strong><br>
  Every time you visit the Site, the following non-personally identifiable 
          information is automatically obtained and compiled: the internet protocol
      (IP) address, the domain name registry information associated with the
      IP address, your internet browser, operating system and hardware platform,
      the date and time of your visit, the name and address (URL) of the web
      page you viewed immediately prior to accessing the current page, your entire
      query (if any) that was entered into a search engine which led you to the
      current site and any other “click stream” data. 
          This information is stored in our log files. Occasionally, if your
      browser is not configured to prevent disclosure of such information, the
      following information may also be revealed: your name, e-mail address,
      home and work addresses, telephone and fax numbers and any plain text commentary.
      Additionally, the complete record of your actions at the website including
      all pages visited, time spent at each page, the information sent or received
      and the names of all files uploaded or downloaded are available. This tracking
      information may be compiled by us in the aggregate and made available to
      third parties primarily to identify demographic data regarding our customers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is important to note that IP addresses do not necessarily reveal 
          the identity of an individual visitor. Since most individuals connect 
          through an internet service provider at home, the IP address would identify 
          the internet service provider and not that actual person. Users should 
          refer to these specific instructions accompanying their browsers to 
          ensure that personal information is not automatically being provided 
          without their agreement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
            <strong>How Is Your Personal Information Used?</strong><br>
          In order to better serve you, we may combine information you give us 
          on-line, in our stores or through print media, with information about 
          your product interests and purchases. We may also combine these with 
          readily available demographic information in order to enhance and personalize 
          your shopping experience with us and to enable us to communicate with 
          you, by e mail or otherwise, about our products, promotions, contests 
          or related third party products or services which we believe may be 
          of interest to you. We gather this information in order to: i) maintain 
          contact with you and provide you with ongoing personalized service; 
          ii) better understand and respond to your needs; and iii) develop, improve 
          and market products and services. We also use this information to measure 
          interest in the various areas of our Site, to ensure that links on the 
          Site facilitate easy navigation and to help make the Site more interesting 
          and informative. Any personal information that we disclose to third 
          parties is done in the aggregate on a non-personally identifiable basis 
          and is used primarily to identify demographic data regarding our customers.
