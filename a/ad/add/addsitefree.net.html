<div class="mainContent"><p>This document is intended to inform consumers how AddSiteFree.NET collects, maintains 
and processes information we collect in the delivery of our network advertising 
services.</p><br>
<p><b>What types of data does AddSiteFree.NET collect?</b><br>
On the AddSiteFree.NET network, we collect non-personally identifiable information 
(non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction 
with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and 
browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information 
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p><br><br>
<p><b>How does AddSiteFree.NET track consumer behavior?</b><br>
Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to 
recognize the computer when you revisit the site. Generally, sites use this 
cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to 
better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable 
sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as 
valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p><br><br> 
<p>Like many websites, AddSiteFree.NET sets a cookie on your computer containing an 
anonymous identifier. This cookie allows AddSiteFree.NET to better target and analyze 
consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant 
advertising.</p><br><br>
<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to 
use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website 
offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all 
cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. 
Note: AddSiteFree.NET employs Flash cookies, which are not deleted via the normal 
browser tools. Please visit Adobe in order to manage Flash cookies. 
Alternatively, you may click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting 
cookies from AddSiteFree.NET. Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or 
change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform 
this process again.</p><br><br>
<p><b>How does AddSiteFree.NET use this information?</b><br>
AddSiteFree.NET has created a technology that uses any consumer information to create 
anonymous consumer segments. For example, consumers that demonstrate car buying 
behaviors are grouped into an auto-buyer segment. These segments will be used to 
target and optimize advertiser campaigns. AddSiteFree.NET will never use this 
information to identify, locate or contact consumers.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Which data do we retain and for how long?</b><br>
We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 90 days. This data 
includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with 
advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and 
browsing behavior. Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information 
including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p><br><br>
<p><b>What if I have questions about how my or other consumers� data is being used?</b><br>
We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquires about privacy 
concerns. Please contact us at privacy@AddSiteFree.NET or the address below with 
any questions of complaints.</p><br><br>

<p>For more information, please see the Network Advertising Initiative web site.
What if I don�t want to be tracked - AddSiteFree.NET Opt-out
You can opt out of the targeted advertising delivered by AddSiteFree.NET by 
requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by AddSiteFree.NET, which will 
prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser. This 
allows you to opt-out of the AddSiteFree.NET tracking system without erasing other 
cookies associated with
your browser.</p><br><br>
<p>This opt-out means that AddSiteFree.NET will not store information unique to your 
browser behavior and will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to 
the next. Opting-out does not mean you will not receive online advertising. 
However, because the network is not able to uniquely identify your browser, 
AddSiteFree.NET is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage 
patterns. 
Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or 
delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.
To opt out of all NAI member networks' behavioral tracking, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">the NAI 
opt-out page.</a></p><br><br>

identifiable information. This can usually be done by contacting Support at

techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and

access to our data and we routinely review our security logs and perform regular 
security audits.</p><br><br>
