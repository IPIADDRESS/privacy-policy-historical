parties</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>We will not forward your personal information to third parties unless this is relevant to answering your request or if legally permitted or required. </p><p>If we forward personal data to third parties, this will be handled according to the legal requirements for this process. </p><p>The data that we share will only be the minimal data needed to achieve the target for which we are contacting the third party.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your right to information and to delete personal data</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If you would like to understand
