                Adam4Adam's Web servers also set session ID cookies that are used to allow our servers to deliver information you request
                (e.g., search results). Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their Web browsers to refuse them; however, doing so
                may prevent most parts of Adam4Adam's site from working (e.g., anything that requires login, including member chat, etc).
                While cookies set by Adam4Adam may be used to collect personally identifiable information and can be traced to an individual user,
                this personally identifiable information is used only for internal purposes.
            </p>
            <h2>Registration Form</h2>
            <p>
                Membership on the Adam4Adam Site is completely optional. Adam4Adam's registration form requires users to give their email address.
                On our join form, required fields are marked. Adam4Adam will never share e-mail addresses with third party organizations without your
                express permission.
            </p>
            <h2>Control of Your Password</h2>
            <p>
                Do not disclose your password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose
                control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password
                has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. To change your password you can do so at any
                time through the MY ACCOUNT page then click <a class="orange" href="http://www.adam4adam.com/change-password">Change Password</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Order Forms</h2>
            <p>
                When purchasing products or services on the Adam4Adam site, you're asked for credit card, billing, and shipping information.
                This information is transmitted using a secure, encrypted form. You can see that the transaction is secure from the fact that the URL
                begins with the secure address https:// and we ensure encryption through the use of standard SSL encryption technologies.
                This credit card information is gathered to bill customers for services purchased. Only billing vendors have access to financial
                information and only for the purpose of billing customers. At times Adam4Adam may refer users to other Web sites to purchase products
                or services. User activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites.
            </p>
            <h2>Community Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam provides many venues for member interaction and community. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms) may
                reveal a user's member name or e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information on the Adam4Adam Site.
                In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas (e.g. profile page) of the Adam4Adam Site,
                and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly
                available should not post in public areas of the Adam4Adam Site.
            </p>
            <h2>Adam4Adam Profiles and ProAds</h2>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam permits users to submit adult-oriented personal information for use in the Adam4Adam Profile and ProAd services.
                This information is also stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and to customize the user's Adam4Adam site
                experience. By registering for Adam4Adam Profiles or ProAd and submitting your user information, you understand that the information
                provided in the profie or ProAd, including your photograph, may be forwarded by members to other members and to persons who are
                not members. Adam4Adam will not knowingly collect Profile or ProAd information from those under the age of 18.
            </p>
            <h2>Member Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the Adam4Adam Site and associated
                services and at times may be shared with Adam4Adam partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific identifying
                characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address or name) removed.
            </p>
            <h2>IP Addresses</h2>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam tracks individual IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad
                demographic information. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes.
            </p>
            <h2>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS</h2>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, Adam4Adam may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a
                valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to
                protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should
                generally remain confidential. Adam4Adam does not disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal
                mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies
                when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards
                is available to all Adam4Adam members, and in many cases other visitors to the Adam4Adam site. Also keep in mind that Adam4Adam
                is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat and instant message-like
                conversations pass through Adam4Adam's servers, we do not store logs of these conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adam4Adam reserves the right to share some or all of your personal information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or
                other companies under common control with Adam4Adam, in which case Adam4Adam will require such entities to honor this privacy
                policy. If Adam4Adam is acquired by another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by Adam4Adam
                and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy policy regarding that information.
            </p>
            <h2>OFF-SITE LINKS</h2>
            <p>
