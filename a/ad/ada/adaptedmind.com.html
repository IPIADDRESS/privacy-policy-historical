In this written Privacy Policy, AdaptedMind.com describes the scope and breadth of our commitment to privacy. AdaptedMind.com may, in its discretion, amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes to our policy will be reflected on this page, so that you remain informed about the information we collect and how we use it. By exploring and using this Site, and by submitting information as you use this Site, you agree to GloWorld's use of such information as described herein.

			  <p><strong>Information That We Collect, and How We Use It</strong><br> 
			    AdaptedMind.com collects information from our users when they create their account for this Site, when they request copies of publications, seek additional information regarding our services or employment opportunities, or register for conferences and other GloWorld-sponsored events. Some of our Site's registration, enrollment, account setup and other forms may ask users to give us contact information, unique personal identifiers, financial information, subject areas of interest and/or demographic information. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Site. We sometimes aggregate demographic information, and the types of systems and browsers of users for internal purposes, so that we may better understand the user population of our Site, identify subject areas of interest, and determine whether the Site is designed to work with the computer settings of a majority of our visitors. GloWorld also may conduct user surveys on the Web, which usually are intended to provide GloWorld with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like. GloWorld uses the information gathered from such surveys to improve our web content, navigation, and overall visitor experience.</p> 
			  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  <p>Any personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, subject areas of interest, etc., allows AdaptedMind.com to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you about other products and services offered by AdaptedMind.com that may be of interest to you. AdaptedMind.com also reserves the right to perform inter-school communications to facilitate the proper functioning of the site. We will not sell, share, or rent or otherwise make available any of that information to other parties, except that we may disclose the information to third parties who perform services on our behalf in connection with the Site and have a need to access the information in connection with those services.
