        <p>ADA.org is the web site of the American Dental Association (“ADA”).
          The ADA respects the privacy of our members and other users of our
          web site. This Privacy Policy addresses our use of information about
          you collected by virtue of your use of ADA.org. </p>
        <p>You may contact us about this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <p>Via postal address 211 E. Chicago Ave.<br>
        Chicago, IL 60611 <br>
        By e-mail <a href="mailto:online@ada.org">online@ada.org</a><br>

        <p><strong><a name="collect" id="collect"></a>Information We May Collect About You</strong></p>
        <p>The information we collect via our Web site is used to improve the
          content of ADA.org and advance the ADA’s mission.</p>
        <p>For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes
          only the user’s domain name, but not the e-mail address (where
          possible).</p>
        <p>We collect the domain name and internet protocol (IP) address of visitors
          to our Web site, aggregate information on what pages users access or
          visit, user-specific information on what pages users access or visit,
          and information volunteered by users, including from surveys, purchases
          and/or registrations. We also may collect the e-mail addresses of those
          who communicate with us via e-mail.</p>
        <p>With respect to cookies: We use cookies for a number of purposes,
          including to administer our web site and to record session information,
          such as items that users add to their shopping cart and user-specific
          information on what pages users access or visit, and to ensure that
          visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.</p>
        <p> <a href="#top" class="returntotop">Return to Top</a></p>
        <p><strong><a name="use" id="use"></a>How We May Use Information We Collect</strong></p>
        <p>The ADA, its subsidiaries and affiliates may use your contact information
          to alert you to new information, products and services, events and
          other opportunities. From time to time, we may also make your contact
          information (but not your e-mail address) available to other reputable
          organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.</p>
        <p>The ADA maintains a directory of dentists that may include information
          you submit via our web site. This directory is shared with state and
          local dental societies. A subset of this directory, containing information
          about ADA members, is publicly accessible on ADA.org. </p>
        <p>With respect to your e-mail address: We have instituted stringent
          reviews and opt-out capabilities to ensure that you do not receive
          unwanted e-mail from the ADA. We will not give or sell your e-mail
          address to any entity outside the ADA, its subsidiaries and affiliated
          entities (such as state and local dental societies). </p>
        <p>A particular ADA subsidiary or affiliate may have certain privacy
          policies even more stringent than noted here, which will be indicated
          on its specific portion of ADA.org or its own site.</p>
        <p> <a href="#top" class="returntotop">Return to Top</a></p>
        <p><strong><a name="yourrights" id="yourrights"></a>Your Rights</strong></p>
        <p>To help us keep our promise to respect your privacy, it is important
          when you wish to exercise your rights that you contact us via any of
          the means listed in the first section of this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p>If you do not want to receive e-mail, postal mail, telephone calls
          or faxes from us in the future, or if you do not want us to share your
          contact information in the manner described above, please provide us
          with your exact name, e-mail and postal addresses, phone and fax numbers
          and, if appropriate, ADA membership number. We will no longer use information
          you so identify and secured via ADA.org , if that is your wish. While
          we will continue to share information we maintain about you with state
          and local dental societies, we will do our best to be sure any other
          specific contact information you so identify is removed from any list
          we share with other organizations. </p>
        <p>On request we provide site visitors with access to all information
          that we may maintain about them, including financial information (e.g.,
          credit card account information), unique identifier information (e.g.,
          user/member number or password), transaction information (e.g., dates
          on which users made purchases, amounts and types of purchases), communications
          that the visitor has directed to our site (e.g., e-mails, user inquiries),
          and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number). </p>
        <p>On request we also offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies
          corrected in contact information, financial information, unique identifiers,
          transaction information and communications that the visitor has directed
          to the site. </p>
        <p>You may also contact us if you believe your information is being used
          for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="children" id="children"></a>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
        <p>We are concerned about protecting children's privacy. We do not offer
          or sell products or services for purchase by children. If you are under
          18 years of age, you may not purchase products or services from, and
          you should not provide information to, ADA.org. without the involvement
          of a parent or guardian. We do not collect online contact information
          without prior parental consent or parental notification, including
          an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and
          participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online
          information will be used only to respond directly to the child's request
          and will not be used for other purposes. Nor without prior parental
          consent do we collect personally identifiable offline contact information,
          distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information
          or give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally
          identifiable contact information. We do not entice by the prospect
          of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information
          than is needed to participate in the activity. </p>
        <p> <a href="#top" class="returntotop">Return to Top</a></p>
        <p><strong><a name="more" id="more"></a>More About Our Privacy Practices</strong></p>
        <p>With respect to other web sites and servers: ADA.org contains links
          to other web sites. We have no control over and take no responsibility
          for the privacy practices or content of those sites. </p>
        <p>The ADA does not partner with or have special relationships with ad server companies. However, we are running an advertising campaign pertaining to Direct Reimbursement on outside Web sites that link to ADA.org. The ADA utilizes transparent 1x1 pixel GIF files, provided by DoubleClick to help manage this online advertising. The information collected is anonymous and not personally identifiable. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="javascript:;" onclick="javascript:FromADA('http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/')">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/</a>.</p>
        <p>With respect to security: We use industry-standard encryption technologies
          when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site.
          When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information
          such as financial or health information, we redirect visitors to a
          secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our
          site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical
          facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information
          that we have collected from you at our site. When users choose to make
          payments via credit cards, we submit the information needed to obtain
          payment to the appropriate clearinghouses. We do not store or reuse
          this credit card information, unless you have given your authorization
          for us to do so.</p>
        <p>Note: Health information you may share via ADA.org is neither private
          nor confidential and should be shared, if at all, only in accordance
          with applicable laws. </p>
        <p> <a href="#top" class="returntotop">Return to Top</a></p>
        <p><strong><a name="changes" id="changes"></a>Changes, Comments and Questions</strong></p>
        <p>If our information practices change at some time in the future we
          will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you and allow
          you to opt out of new uses. The latest version of our Privacy Policy
          will always be available at ADA.org. If you are concerned about how
          your information may be used, please check back at our Web site periodically.</p>
        <p>We welcome your comments or questions about our Privacy Policy and
          privacy practices. If you feel that this site is not following its
          stated policy, please let us know.</p>
