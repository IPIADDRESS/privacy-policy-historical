You should note that  different privacy policies may apply to other parts of ADT’s web presence - for  example, separate privacy policies apply to public web pages, online recruiting  pages or for which an authorized ADT dealer registers and logs in.</p>              <p><em>Anonymous Information</em>. &nbsp;We may collect two types of information  through this Site: anonymous information and personally identifiable  information ("PII"). &nbsp;We collect certain  anonymous data regarding the usage of the website. &nbsp;This information does not personally identify  users, by itself or in combination with other information. &nbsp;We gather it to improve the performance of the  Site. &nbsp;The anonymous data we collect can  include information such as the type of browser you are using, IP address, the  pages you view, and the length of your visit to the Site. &nbsp;</p>              <p><em>Personally Identifiable Information.</em> &nbsp;We may also ask you to provide personally  identifiable information on the Site, which may include your name, address, telephone  number, fax number, company name, e-mail address and relevant details about the  product or service that interests you. &nbsp;These  details may include whether the location is a business or residence, whether  the site is pre-wired for security, and the square footage, to give some  examples. &nbsp;This information can be  gathered when you send us an e-mail or when you complete the specific web page  request form. &nbsp;In all such cases you  choose whether to provide us with the personally identifiable information, but  certain portions of the Site may not be available to you or we may not be able  to respond to your inquiry effectively if you do not provide the PII  requested.&nbsp; </p>              <p><em>My Account.</em> &nbsp;In order to provide some of the services on  the Site, we ask you to provide additional personal information regarding your  customer account with ADT. &nbsp;This  additional information may include existing account numbers, payment or credit  card details, service preferences and so forth. &nbsp;We will use this information only to support  your customer relationship with ADT. &nbsp;This  includes responding to your requests, customizing your experience on the Site,  communicating with you about your account, and providing you choices about how  to view and manage the products and services that you receive from ADT.</p>              <p><em>Customer Service Correspondence. </em>We and our third  party service providers may also collect personal information related to  customer service correspondence. This information may include e-mails, internet  chats, faxes, or telephone calls directed to our customer service centers. We  process this information to provide you with customer services, handle your  complaints or disputes, measure and improve our customer services, and to  detect and prevent fraud or violations of our legal obligations. We will only  retain customer service information as long as is reasonably required to carry  out our business purposes or to comply with applicable legal obligations.</p>              <p><em>Surveys and Contests.</em> &nbsp;We may occasionally request information from  you via surveys or contests. &nbsp;Your  participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. &nbsp;The information that we request typically  includes your contact details. &nbsp;If you  choose to participate, the information that you provide will be shared with the  contest/survey sponsors to notify winners and award prizes. &nbsp;Survey information may also be used to monitor  and improve the content and performance of the Site. </p>              <p><em>Testimonials. </em>With your consent we may post your testimonial along  with your name.&nbsp; If you wish to update or  delete your testimonial, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a>. </p>              <p><em>Tell A Friend</em>. &nbsp;If you choose to use ADT’s referral service to  inform a friend about our Site, products or services, ADT will ask you for your  friend’s name and email address. &nbsp;We will  send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. &nbsp;We will store this information so that we can  send the initial email message and track the success of our referral program. &nbsp;Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> to have their information removed from our database.</p>              <p>If you wish to modify, update or delete  any information we have received, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a>. </p>                <h4>ONLINE ACTIVITY AND TRACKING </h4>              <p>Like many  websites, the Site employs technologies such as cookies and web beacons (also known  as clear GIFs) to automatically receive and store certain information about  your use of the Site. We use this information to permit the Site to function  properly, to evaluate how you use the Site, to determine where you are located,  and to support website analytics and our marketing efforts.</p>              <p><em>Use of Cookies.</em> Cookies refer to  small bits of data that are based on your internet activity and stored as text  files by your internet browser on your computer’s hard drive. Through the use  of cookies, we may collect information about your location and your online  activity on the Site, such as the specific web pages that you visit, the links  you click, and the serves you perform on the Site. When you visit other  websites where we advertise, we or a third party may use data collected on the  Site to show you interest-based advertisements. Although most internet browsers  are initially set to accept cookies, you can generally find a "help" section on  the browser toolbar that will inform you how to stop accepting cookies, to be  notified when you receive a browser cookie, and to disable existing browser  cookies. However, without browser cookies you will be unable to take advantage of  all the features that the Site has to offer.</p>              <p><em>Use of Web Beacons.</em> Web beacons are tiny  graphics embedded on a website that allow the website to transfer or collect  information through a graphic image request. We may use web beacons to collect  information about your web browsing activities to help us determine if a  particular webpage on the Site has been visited, and, if so, how many times.  This information permits us or third parties to deliver interest-based  advertisements, measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising,  and to customize the services offered to the Site’s users. We do not tie the  information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable  information.</p>              <p>Certain  pages on our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel  tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain  information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on  which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the  time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view  the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log  files to store the data that is collected through web beacons. ADT also uses  third party web beacons to help manage online advertising. These web beacons  are provided by our ad management partners, Google Analytics, and Omniture.  These files enable Google Analytics and Omniture to recognize a unique cookie  on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements  bring users to our web site. The cookie on your web browser was placed by ADT,  or by another advertiser who works with Google Analytics. With both cookies and  web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous  and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address,  telephone number, or email address. For more information about Google Analytics,  including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="http://www.google-analytics.com/" title="http://www.google-analytics.com/" target="_blank">www.google-analytics.com</a>. For  more information about Omniture, including how to opt out of these  technologies, go to <a href="http://www.omniture.com/" title="http://www.omniture.com/" target="_blank">www.omniture.com.</a></p>              <p><em>Third Parties.</em> As noted above, we  have relationships with third party service providers to place advertisements  on our behalf on other websites, to perform tracking and other similar  functions for the Site and our advertisements, and to assist us in providing  you with customer services. While we do not share your personal information  with these companies, they may automatically collect information about your visit  to the Site, your IP address, your browser and your network by using cookies  and web beacons. Such information may be used to present you with advertisements  tailored to your interests, to provide you with customer service, and to better  understand how the Site is used, among other things. Any information collected  by such third parties via cookies or web beacons is not linked to any personal  information that we collect from you. The use of cookies and web beacons by  third parties is governed by their privacy policies, not this Web Privacy  Policy. Some of these third party companies may be members of the Network Advertising  Initiative, which offers additional information regarding cookies and web  beacons, as well as a single location to opt out of interest-based advertising  from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.com" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.com</a>). </p>              <p><em>Social Media Features.</em>&nbsp; Our website includes Social Media Features,  such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or  interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your  IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie  to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets  are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your  interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the  company providing  it. </p>                <h4>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h4>              <p><em>Uses by ADT. </em>ADT uses  the personal information you provide through the Site in a manner that is  consistent with this Web Privacy Policy. &nbsp;If you provide personal information for a  certain reason, we may use it in connection with the reason for which it was  provided. &nbsp;For instance, if you contact  us by email, we may use the personal information you provide to answer your  question or resolve your problem. &nbsp;We use  the information collected through the Site for statistical purposes and for  improving the Site, as well as for our marketing purposes and potentially  sending commercial emails to you. &nbsp;We  often engage a third party’s software or services to assist us with these collections  and analyses. &nbsp;As a practical matter, we  must release your mailing address to a postal or courier service to deliver  information you requested. &nbsp;We use  third-parties to assist us with our marketing efforts, including assisting us  with sending emails to you. &nbsp;This may  include sending you free electronic newsletters and marketing-related emails  for services described on our Site. &nbsp;However, you will have the choice to opt out  of receiving newsletters and marketing emails for our services by either  contacting us directly at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a> or through the "unsubscribe"  link found at the bottom of our newsletters and emails.&nbsp;</p>              <p>In  addition to using your information to populate your My Account pages, ADT and  our agents will use your personal information to process purchase orders that  you submit via the Site and enable you to track the progress of purchase  orders. &nbsp;This may include sharing certain  data with delivery providers such as UPS and providing you access to shipper  tracking numbers. &nbsp;Similarly, if you  qualify for any rewards based on your purchase history, this information will also  be processed by ADT and our agents to enable your access to these benefits.</p>              <p>On certain  of our Site pages where you have submitted detailed information concerning  potential products or services, we will use this information only for the  purposes of contacting you and determining which product or services may be  most relevant to you. &nbsp;We will not share  this information with any third party for their own marketing purposes without  your prior consent.</p>              <p>We will retain your information for as long as  your account is active or as needed to provide you services.&nbsp; If you wish to cancel your account or request  that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adt.com">privacy@adt.com</a>.  We may  also disclose personally identifiable information in order to respond to a  subpoena, court order or other such request. &nbsp;We may also provide such personally  identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or  as otherwise required by law.&nbsp; </p>              <p>We may  provide your personally identifiable information to a third party if we file  for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets or ownership in connection  with proposed or consummated corporate reorganizations, such as mergers,  acquisitions, or sales of business units.</p>              <p><em>Uses by  Third-Parties.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></em><em>We may also provide your personally identifiable  information to third party service providers that help us to provide you with  products and services. These third party service providers have access to such  information on a confidential basis and only to the extent necessary to perform  their requested functions.</em></p>              <p><em>We do not provide your  personally identifiable information to any third party for their own marketing  purposes without your prior request or consent. Sometimes these businesses make  special offers available to Site customers. If you request to receive  information about these offers, we will share your personal information with  these companies so that they can send you details about their special offers. You  should know in advance that each of these companies has its own policies with  respect to the collection and use of personal information and that we are not  responsible for their use of your information. </em></p>                <h4>INFORMATION SECURITY AND SECURE TRANSACTIONS</h4>              <p>We have implemented  various security measures for the purpose of protecting your personal  information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss,  alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access and against any other unlawful  forms of processing. &nbsp;When you create a  user profile and log in to a secure portion of our Site, your personal  information benefits from the protections of Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL")  technology. &nbsp;Our web servers have been  enabled with SSL technology to automatically encrypt your information and help  prevent unauthorized parties from viewing your account or payment information  during a secure session. &nbsp;This is why you  must enter your unique user name and password each time you access your account  information online or place a purchase order through the Site.</p>              <p>You are responsible for  maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. &nbsp;You are responsible for all uses of your  password, whether or not authorized by you. &nbsp;You must inform us immediately of any unauthorized  use or your user name or password.</p>              <p>However, the transmission of data over the internet by its nature entails the use of  systems under the control of third parties, and as a result ADT will work to  prevent any violation of the security systems but cannot ensure total control  of the security of such systems.</p>                <h4>OTHER WEBSITES</h4>              <p>Please be aware that our Site may  contain links to other sites on the internet that are owned and operated by  third parties. &nbsp;Our Site utilizes  framing techniques to make it appear that the user is still on the site when  the user is actually on a third party website. For example, if you are on a  page that has the look and feel of www.adt.com but the URL listed in the  properties of your browser is a different URL, then know that the information  is being collected by this third party and their Privacy Policy governs the  collection and use of this information.</p>              <p>The  information practices of those websites linked to our Site are not covered by  this Policy. &nbsp;We are not responsible for  the privacy policies of websites to which the Site links.&nbsp; If you provide any information to such third  parties, different rules regarding the collection and use of your PII may  apply. We strongly suggest you review such third party’s privacy policies  before providing any data to them.&nbsp;These other sites may send their own  cookies or web beacons to users, collect data or solicit personally  identifiable information. &nbsp;We cannot control this collection of  information. You should contact these entities directly if you have any  questions about their use of the information that they collect.  </p>                <h4>CHILDREN</h4>              <p>ADT understands the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the  interactive online world. &nbsp;The Site  covered by this policy is not designed for or intentionally targeted at  children 13 years of age or younger.
