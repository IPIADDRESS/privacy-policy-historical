      <p><b><font size="3">U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Privacy Policy</font></b></p>

      <p>Clickbooth.com, LLC (“Clickbooth”) recognizes that privacy is very
      important to our clients and business partners, and we pledge to protect the
      security and privacy of any personal information that clients and business partners
      provide to us. This includes clients’ and business partners’ personally
      identifiable information. Not only does Clickbooth strive to collect, use, and
      disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries
      in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest
      ethical standards in its business practices. This US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Policy
      (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that Clickbooth follows with
      respect to transfers of personal information from the European Union (EU) to the
      United States.</p>

      <p><u><b>SAFE HARBOR</b></u></p>

      <p>The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed
      on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable
      U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that ensures
      adequate protection for personal information transferred from the EEA to the United
      States (the "US-EU Safe Harbor"). The EEA also has recognized the U.S.-EU Safe
      Harbor as providing adequate data protection. Consistent with our commitment to
      protect personal privacy, Clickbooth adheres to the principles set forth in the
      U.S. - EU Safe Harbor.</p>

      <p><u><b>SCOPE</b></u></p>

      <p>This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to all personal
      information received by Clickbooth in the United States from the EU, in any format
      including electronic, paper or verbal.</p>

      <p><u><b>DEFINITIONS</b></u></p>

      <p>The following definitions shall apply throughout this Policy:</p>

      <p>"Agent" means any third party that uses personal information provided to
      Clickbooth to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of
      Clickbooth.</p>

      <p>"Clickbooth" means Clickbooth.com, LLC, and each of its predecessors, successors
      and affiliates.</p>

      <p>"Personal information" means any information or set of information that
      identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Clickbooth to identify an
      individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded,
      anonymous, aggregated or publicly available information that has not been combined
      with non-public personal information.</p>

      <p>"Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race,
      ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade
      union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, Clickbooth will
      treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party
      where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive.</p>

      <p><u><b>PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</b></u></p>

      <p>The privacy principles in this Policy are based on and in accordance with the
      Safe Harbor Principles. Additional information about the Safe Harbor program is
      available at the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at
      <u>www.export.gov/safeharbor</u>.</p>

      <p><b>NOTICE:</b> When Clickbooth collects personal information directly from
      individuals in the EU, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects
      and uses their personal information, the types of non-agent third parties, if any,
      to which Clickbooth discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any,
      that Clickbooth offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their
      personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language
      when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to Clickbooth, or
      as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Clickbooth uses the
      information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally
      collected.</p>

      <p>If Clickbooth receives personal information from other entities in the EU, it
      will use such information in accordance with the notices such entities provided and
      the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.</p>

      <p><b>CHOICE:</b> Clickbooth will offer individuals the opportunity to choose
      (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent
      third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it
      was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>

      <p>For sensitive personal information, Clickbooth will give individuals the
      opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of
      the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a
      purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or
      subsequently authorized by the individual.</p>

      <p>Clickbooth will provide individuals with reasonable methods to exercise their
      choices.</p>

      <p><b>DATA INTEGRITY:</b> Clickbooth will use personal information only in ways
      that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently
      authorized by the individual. Clickbooth will take reasonable steps to ensure that
      personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and
      current.</p>

      <p><b>TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:</b> Clickbooth will obtain assurances from its agents
      that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy.
      Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a
      contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as
      is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, Safe Harbor certification by
      the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g.,
      companies located in Canada). If Clickbooth has knowledge that an agent is using or
      disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, Clickbooth
      will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure.</p>

      <p><b>ACCESS AND CORRECTION:</b> Upon request, Clickbooth will grant individuals
      reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them, and Clickbooth
      will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete
      information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

      <p><b>SECURITY:</b> Clickbooth will take reasonable precautions to protect personal
      information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access,
      disclosure, alteration and destruction. We use reasonable, industry-standard
      precautions, including appropriate technical, administrative, and physical
      procedures, to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access,
      disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

      <p><b>ENFORCEMENT:</b> Clickbooth uses a self-assessment approach to assure
      compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is
      accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently
      displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Safe
      Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the
      contact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any
      complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in
      accordance with the Principles. If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved
      through our internal process, we agree to dispute resolution using an independent
      resource mechanism as a third party resolution provider.</p>

      <p><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</b> Any questions or concerns regarding the use or
      disclosure of personal information should be directed to the Clickbooth Privacy
      Office at the address given below. Clickbooth will investigate and attempt to
      resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal
      information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. For
      complaints that cannot be resolved between Clickbooth and the complainant,
      Clickbooth has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the
      panel established by the European Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) to resolve
      disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>
