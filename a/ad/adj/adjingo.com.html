AdJingo           collects information from users responding to ads regarding their Internet           provider; this information may include the user's IP address, host name,           country of origin and Internet provider being used. This collected information           may be shared with the user placing the ad for the sole purpose of assisting           this user in determining the validity and legitimacy of the response.           Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information           is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We may use information           collected to promote other affiliate programs, products, web sites and           services. <br>

A cookie is a small text file stored on the client user's hard drive containing           information about the user. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any           personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes           their browser, a cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a           cookie for AdJingo, the user would not have to log in a password more           than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  Cookies can also enable           us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience           on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).           However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
