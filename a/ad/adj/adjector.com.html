                        The Site uses technology called “cookies.”  A cookie is a tiny element of data that the Site can send to your 
                        browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so that we can recognize you when you return. Cookies also 
                        allow us to store Site users’ preferences and to record session information. We do not link the information we 
                        store in cookies to any personal information that you submit while on the Site.  You may be able to configure 
                        your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set -- each browser is 
                        different, so check the applicable “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. 
                        If you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will still be able to use the Site.  The Site may also use 
                        technology called “tracer tags.”  These may also be referred to as “Clear GIFs” or “Web Beacons.”  This technology 
                        allows us to understand which pages you visit on the Site.  These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and 
                        tailor the Site for you and other future Site visitors.  To find out more about cookies, please visit
