      <p class="body margintop">AdColony, a division of Jirbo, Inc., is a mobile advertising company.   We provide a mobile video advertising network (“AdColony," "we," "us," "our" or “company”) that helps our advertisers deliver video ads primarily via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

This policy outlines AdColony’s privacy practices for our video advertising network (the “Network”) and our website, www.AdColony.com (the “Website”).

      <h2 class="headline">AdColony’s Website Privacy Practices</h2>
      <h3 class="title">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
      <p class="body">AdColony collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) from the Website, www.AdColony.com, when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that   specifically  identifies or locates a particular person or entity. We receive and store any PII you provide to us. The types of PII collected may include your name, postal address, telephone number, and email address. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, by completing an online form on this website, or by signing up for our service or e-newsletter. AdColony uses this information our business purposes, including to contact you to respond to your inquiry or to provide the service requested. Once collected, AdColony will store your PII for as long as needed to provide services and for a reasonable time thereafter for record keeping purposes.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p class="body">AdColony also collects non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) from visitors to the Website. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to specifically identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system. We use this information to help manage and improve the Website.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Cookies</h3>
      <p class="body">We may utilize "cookies" to automatically collect information about visitors to the Website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your browser and that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages on our Website are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect PII. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer's or mobile device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some features of the Website.  We may also collect information on our Website using Web "beacons." Web beacons are electronic images used on the Website or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and activity on the Website and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit <a class="link" target="new" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Controlling our use of the PII Collected via the Website</h3>
      <p class="body">You can always opt not to disclose PII to us, but keep in mind some PII may be needed to take advantage of some features of the Website. You may request deletion of your PII by sending an e-mail to <a class="link" target="new" href="mailto:privacy@adcolony.com">privacy@adcolony.com</a>.

      <h2 class="headline">AdColony’s Advertising Network Privacy Practices</h2>
      <h3 class="title">Network Overview</h3>
      <p class="body">The AdColony Network offers a leading mobile video advertising and monetization platform that plays crystal-clear HD video at lightning speed and drives deep engagement with content. AdColony's proprietary Instant-Play™ video ad technology serves video ads instantly on the most popular apps in the world across Apple's iOS and Google's Android platforms. The Network provides certain services to advertisers and publishers and collects mobile device information in the process. Generally, the Network may access, index, and cache requests made from the mobile sites, applications and device platforms (collectively, “Mobile Apps and Sites”) in order to deliver, tailor and report on the ads being run over the Network.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Information we collect and use via the Network</h3>
      <p class="body">We do not collect PII via the Network. In the course of running the Network, we collect Non-PII from Mobile Apps and Sites and use such data for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to, providing publishers, advertisers and others with Non-PII information about traffic and Mobile App and Site usage on the Network.</p>

      <p class="body margintop">We also collect certain information about visitors to the Mobile Apps and Sites on the Network, including device model and type, O/S version, mobile device ID, device language, the name of the Mobile Apps and Sites on which our advertisements are served, and the date/time an advertisement was served and/or clicked on the Network. We may track that information over time and across multiple Mobile Apps and Sites and use Non-PII collected from such visitors to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to visitors. We may use, supplement and share Non-PII collected on the Network in our discretion for a variety of business purposes.  For example, we use such information to perform analysis aimed at improving our Network and we may also use this data to display advertising customized to visitors' interests and preferences. Because our services are continually evolving, we reserve the right to use the information that we collect for other legal purposes that are consistent with this Privacy Policy, even if not specifically described herein.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Ad Network Data Retention</h3>
      <p class="body">We retain Non-PII collected via the Network in non-aggregate form for as long as we believe it is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, but not longer than 36 months from the date of your last interaction with our Network. After such 36-month period, we aggregate the data and use it for analytics and similar purposes.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Choices regarding the Non-PII Collected via the Network</h3>
      <p class="body">AdColony utilizes technology that allows us to deliver certain behaviorally targeted advertising on our Network.  Our server may deliver certain customized information to Mobile Sites and Apps on the Network based on certain Non-PII associated with your device. If you’d like to opt-out from having this Non-PII used to tailor advertising to you, please click <a href="opt-out" class="link">here</a> and follow the instructions. Once you’ve opted out, AdColony will continue to collect information as explained under this Privacy Policy but will no longer use your information to deliver behaviorally targeting advertising to your device. Please note that you will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests.  Please also note that our opt-out technology is device specific.  Therefore, if you use multiple devices you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each device. Certain devices and device configurations may prevent our opt-out from operating correctly.</p>

      <p class="body marginbottom">You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) opt-out tools to learn more about targeted or interest based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs not associated with AdColony.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">Privacy Practices for both the Network and Website</h2>
      <h3 class="title">Information Security And Integrity</h3>
      <p class="body">The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Website. AdColony has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information, both during transmission and once it is received. This includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure; therefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it cannot guarantee absolute security. We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use. If you have any questions about these security or data integrity practices, please email <a class="link" target="new" href="mailto:privacy@adcolony.com">privacy@adcolony.com</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Information Relating to Children</h3>
      <p class="body">We are very sensitive to the importance of children’s privacy.  The Website and Network are directed to business and are neither developed for, nor directed at, children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect or use information to the extent prohibited by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.  Nor do we knowingly create profile segments of children under 13 years of age. If you believe your child has provided us with information that is covered by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or has registered with our Website, please contact us at <a class="link" target="new" href="mailto:privacy@adcolony.com">privacy@adcolony.com</a> and we will make reasonable attempts to have the data purged from our records.</p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
      <p class="body">AdColony does not rent or sell your PII to third parties without your consent. The company may, however, share PII with trusted third-party partners. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information for purposes other than performing services for AdColony. Please note that AdColony may freely share Non-PII and anonymous data collected on the Website or via the Network with unaffiliated third parties. </p>

      <p class="body margintop">AdColony may disclose any information under our control to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.</p>

      <p class="body margintop">AdColony also may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If AdColony is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your PII, as well as any choices you may have regarding your PII.</p>

      <p class="body margintop">Finally, AdColony may disclose or utilize your PII in other ways if you have consented to such disclosure or usage. </p>

      <h3 class="title margintop">Third Party Sites and Applications</h3>
      <p class="body">AdColony regularly interacts with third party sites and applications. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites and applications. When linking to another site or application, you should read that party's privacy policy. </p>

      <h4 class="title margintop">Safe Harbor Privacy Principles</h4>
