      <p>Your privacy while visiting our site is important to us. Because we
      gather certain types of information about the users of our site, we feel
      you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the
      capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what

      </b><p><b>Overall<br>
      </b>The Ad Council may use cookies to track aggregated traffic patterns.
      Cookies are automatically assigned by a Web server. A cookie is a small
      data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit
      them. A cookie file can contain information that the site uses to track
      the pages you have visited. But the only personal information a cookie can
      contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off
      your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. You can refuse
      cookies by turning cookies off in your browser.</p>
      <p>This site contains links to other sites in which the Ad Council is not
      responsible for the content or privacy practices of such sites. The Ad
      Council encourages you to review the privacy policies of the sites that
      you visit, especially before submitting your personal information.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted in this privacy statement, the Ad Council does
      not give, sell or rent individual user information collected on our site
      to any third party.</p>

      </b><p><b>Material Fulfillment<br>
      </b>Members of the media industry can order Ad Council materials from the
      site by submitting their information and request via an online form. The
      form is then emailed to the designated Ad Council representative and may
      be forwarded to our fulfillment vendor. <font size="2">Unless you have
      requested to be added to our database, the contact information submitted
      by you is not used by the Ad Council for any additional purposes other
      than to fulfill the specified request</font>.</p>
