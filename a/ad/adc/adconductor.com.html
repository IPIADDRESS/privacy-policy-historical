<p><strong>Data Collection of User Information</strong></p>

<p>All users are anonymous to <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>. As ads are delivered, <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. This non-personally identifying information can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, sites you have visited, products you have researched and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax's&nbsp;</span>advertisers.&nbsp; There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, registration questionnaire or the like. For such programs, <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>(or a third party working in conjunction with <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser. The adviser uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>may aggregate this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically.&nbsp; This provides the advertiser precise profiles of the types of individuals that respond to the ads.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Health Related Information</strong></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data. <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>does not collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information" includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic and family medical history. <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>maintains internal policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or use of such information.&nbsp; <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>may use general health related information with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not considered "sensitive consumer information." This information can include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based on previous visit to an advertiser's website, retargeting based upon the visit to a general health, fitness, wellness or nutrition website, or retargeting based on your visit to a website where interest can be inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a visit to an infant car-seat review page.</p>

<p><strong>P3P</strong></p>

<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for ad networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An ad network or website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's visitors. A visitor's web browser can download the machine-readable privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't match. <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>has incorporated this technology in its ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.</p>

When you are served a <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>ad, <span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>may assign various information in a cookie on ads you've seen, information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 24px;">RhythmMax&nbsp;</span>collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of analyzing Addendum campaign results, ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and preventing fraud across our sites.&nbsp; We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website or our member sites.
