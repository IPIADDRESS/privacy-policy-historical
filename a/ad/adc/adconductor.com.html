					<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<h3>Effective date: March 21, 2014</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the privacy of web users must be protected and the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine their data to the site level. Burst Media as well as adConductor collect no personally identifiable data, and therefore, protect user privacy.</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and http://www.AdConductor.com owned and operated by Burst Media Corporation (“Burst Media” or “Burst”). This privacy policy describes how Burst Media collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites:&nbsp; http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and <a href="http://www.adconductor.com/">http://www.AdConductor.com</a>.</p>
<p>It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
<div>
<h1>FOR THOSE WHO VIEW AN AD ON A SITE THAT IS A MEMBER OF Burst</h1>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Data Collection of User Information</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>All users who receive an ad served by Burst retain complete anonymity where Burst is concerned. As ads are delivered, Burst does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. Burst does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. This non-personally identifying information can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad’s effectiveness on behalf of Burst clients and customers.</p>
<p>There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, Burst (or a third party working in conjunction with Burst and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. When requested, Burst may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>PRIVACY</h3>
<p>Burst Media is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and is in compliance with the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Principles, and adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<h3>USE OF HEALTH RELATED INFORMATION</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Burst is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data. Burst Media does not collect or use “sensitive consumer information” (as defined in the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on sensitive consumer information. “Sensitive consumer information” includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic and family medical history. Burst Media maintains internal policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or use of such information.</p>
<p>Burst may use general health related information with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not considered “sensitive consumer information.” This information can include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based on previous visit to an advertiser’s website, retargeting based upon the visit to a general health/fitness/wellness/nutrition website, or retargeting based on the visit to a website where interest can be inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a visit to a infant car-seat review page.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>P3P</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for Ad Networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An Ad Network or website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site’s visitors. A visitor’s Web browser can download the machine-readable privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the user’s preferences. This way, the user’s browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user’s preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don’t match. Burst Media has incorporated this technology in its ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Cookie Principle</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Burst may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the purpose of identifying your web browser. When you are served a Burst ad, Burst may assign in a cookie various information on ads you’ve seen, information on sites you’ve visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over – thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.</p>
<p>Burst Media collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of: 1) analyzing campaign results, 2) ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and 3) preventing fraud across our sites.</p>
<p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site or our member sites. We may obtain anonymous information about you – such as sites you have visited or products you have researched – from third-party sources, and combine it with data that we have collected to better target advertising that match your interests. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.</p>
<p>In an effort to respect your privacy, Burst Media gives all internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving Burst Media cookies. If you would like to opt out, please visit our Cookie Opt-out Program at <a href="index.php/company/opt-out" target="_blank">www.burstmedia.com/company/opt-out</a>. Alternatively, you may also choose to opt out of receiving Burst Media cookies through the Network Advertising Initiative’s <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Program</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Third-Party Measurement Services</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1×1 pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The information collected can include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Date/time of your visit</li>
<li>The banner ad that was shown</li>
<li>Unique user ID</li>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>The URLs of sites you visit</li>
</ol>
<p>This information can also be used for online preference marketing (“profiling”) purposes. In these instances, Burst has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"> click here</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<h3>Effective date: March 21, 2014</h3>

  <p>Fundamentally, the privacy of web users must be protected and  the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine their data  to the site level. Burst Media as well as adConductor collect no  personally identifiable data, and therefore, protect user privacy.</p>

<div>
  <h1>FOR THOSE WHO VIEW AN AD ON A SITE THAT IS A MEMBER OF Burst</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Data Collection of User Information</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>All users who receive an ad served by Burst retain complete  anonymity where Burst is concerned. As ads are delivered, Burst does not  acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name,  address, phone number, and email address all remain your private  property. Burst does, however, collect information that is specific to  how you use the Internet. This non-personally identifying information  can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the  geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and  your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of  targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of  Burst clients and customers.</p>
  <p>There are instances where a user may provide specific personal  information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase  agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, Burst (or a  third party working in conjunction with Burst and the advertiser)  acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client  uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the  user. When requested, Burst may employ this information in a compiled  format without identifying users specifically to provide to the  advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals  responding to the ads.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>USE OF HEALTH RELATED INFORMATION</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Burst is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)  and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data.   Burst Media does not  collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's  Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising  activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on  sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information"  includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers,  insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that  describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual  derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled  devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential  future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic,  genomic and family medical history. Burst Media maintains internal  policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or  use of such information.</p>
  <p>Burst may use general health related information with  customized advertising campaigns.  General health-related information  that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not  considered "sensitive consumer information."  This information can  include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based  on previous visit to an advertiser's website, retargeting based upon  the visit to a general health/fitness/wellness/nutrition website, or  retargeting based on the visit to a website where interest can be  inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a  visit to a infant car-seat review page. </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>P3P</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for  Ad Networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a  machine-readable syntax. An Ad Network or website will deploy P3P in  order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's  visitors. A visitor's Web browser can download the machine-readable  privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the  user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically  notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's  preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't  match. Burst Media has incorporated this technology in its ad servers.  Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>The Cookie Principle</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Burst may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. A  cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the  purpose of identifying your web browser. When you are served a Burst ad,  Burst may assign in a cookie various information on ads you've seen,  information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your  computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to  the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of  how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can  help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing  your online Web viewing experience.</p>
  <p>Burst Media collects this information via our technology and it  may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of: 1) analyzing  campaign results, 2) ensuring that our technology is functioning  properly, and 3) preventing fraud across our sites.</p>
  <p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site or our  member sites. We may obtain anonymous information about you - such as  sites you have visited or products you have researched - from  third-party sources, and combine it with data that we have collected to  better target advertising that match your interests. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to  prevent that use if you desire.</p>
  <p>In an effort to respect your privacy, Burst Media gives all  internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving Burst Media cookies.  If you would like to opt out, please visit our Cookie Opt-out Program at <a href="index.php/company/opt-out" target="_blank">www.burstmedia.com/company/opt-out</a>. Alternatively, you may also choose to opt out of receiving Burst Media cookies through the Network Advertising Initiative's <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Program</a>.</p>

<div>
  <h3>Third-Party Measurement Services</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider  other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the  performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1  pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for  their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information  about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The  information collected can include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Date/time of your visit</li>
    <li>The banner ad that was shown</li>
    <li>Unique user ID</li>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
    <li>The URLs of sites you visit</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This information can also be used for online preference  marketing ("profiling") purposes. In these instances, Burst has no  control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not  be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement  service where collected information is concerned.</p>

<p>
  <strong>DECLARATION OF METHODOLOGY </strong>
  <br><br>
  <strong>WHAT IAB CERTIFICATION MEANS</strong>
  <br><br>
  To receive Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Certification, a network or exchange must:
  <br>
  </p><ul>
    <li>-Adhere to the IAB Network &amp; Exchanges Quality Assurance Guidelines</li>
    <li>-Perform an internal audit on a quarterly basis to ensure that the guidelines are consistently and completely followed</li>
    <li>-Submit 2 public affidavits to the IAB annually, one from the Compliance Officer and one from the CEO, CFO or business unit head of the network or exchange</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Networks and exchanges that voluntarily agree to self-certify against these guidelines are providing marketers and agencies with a standardized approach that is designed to make buying easier and to give increased control over where ads are placed. Marketers and agencies will have greater brand safety assurances that their ads will not appear next to content that they decide is inappropriate.
  <br><br>
  The following disclosure is made in connection with our self-certification and is intended to provide publishers and advertisers with an understanding of our capabilities and practices which are compliant with the IAB Network &amp; Exchanges Quality Assurance Guidelines.
  <br><br>
  This document is not intended to replace our standard Terms and Conditions or the insertion order (IO), which are contractual documents, but is intended to supplement those documents to fully disclose our practices under the IAB Network &amp; Exchanges Quality Assurance Guidelines.
<p></p>

<p>
  <strong>ACQUIRING INVENTORY</strong>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Burst Media (Burst) provides advertisers with various levels of inventory source level transparency. The IO between Burst and an advertiser documents the level of transparency provided for a specific advertising campaign. Dependent on the advertising contract between Burst and an advertiser, Burst provides:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>-Full disclosure (certain site list): Burst provides the advertiser with a complete disclosure of all websites prior to running impressions (at least specifying the domain name) where ads may run. This list contains a comprehensive list of websites where the advertiser may run. The advertiser will not necessarily run on all sites listed, but the advertiser will not run on any sites other than those listed. The full site list will be attached to the IO if required by the advertiser.</li>
        <li>-Partial disclosure (representative site list): Burst provides the advertiser with a list of some of the sites where ads will run. This list will contain a representative list of websites where the advertiser will run. The advertiser may run on sites other than those listed but the advertiser will not necessarily run on all sites listed. The partial site list will be attached to the IO if required by the advertiser.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All ads for a specific buy will run on publishers that Burst has a direct relationship with. A direct relationship is where Burst has a contractual agreement to acquire inventory directly from the publisher or an authorized publisher agent (APA).<br><br></li>
    <li>Burst will disclose in the insertion order, if required by the advertiser, information about the type of content surrounding its inventory. Burst will provide information on the following characteristics:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>-The presence of user-generated content (UGC).</li>
        <li>-Burt requires all websites in its networks to have a current, active and publicly stated privacy policy.</li>
        <li>-Burst's site eligibility requirements exclude sites with the following content from joining its networks; unmoderated UGC, extreme graphic/explicit violence, pornography, profane content and hate content.</li>
        <li>-For each agreement, Burst will disclose the ad positioning if required in the IO. The ad positioning of each placement will be identified as either above the fold or below the fold if required by the advertiser and this will be noted in the insertion order.</li>
        <li>-For each agreement, Burst will provide ad tag descriptors if required in the IO for the following:
          <ul>
            <li>-Expandable creative</li>
            <li>-Rich media properties</li>
            <li>-Behavior within the creative (i.e. Host- or user-initiated)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>-For each agreement, Burst will disclose if video advertising is accepted if required in the IO</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
<p></p>

<p>
  <strong>CONTEXTUAL TAXONOMY AND TARGETING</strong>
  <br>
  </p><ol>
    <li>Burst complies with Tiers 1 &amp; 2 of the IAB Contextual Taxonomy.<br></li>
    <li>For each agreement, Burst will disclose the contextual targeting levels if required in the IO. Contextual targeting levels include the following:<br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>-Site Level: targeting to endemic sites where the majority of the content is on a specific topic can be targeted at site level.</li>
        <li>-Site Section Level: subsections of sites are classified into subordinate categories.</li>
        <li>-None (Not targeting content but targeting users.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
<p></p>

<p>
  <strong>INVENTORY VETTING</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>Every publisher with whom we have a direct relationship goes through an inventory vetting process that establishes the following:</li><li>
</li><li>1) Rating system for website content. The site rating is determined when the site first joins our networks. Additional procedures are performed on a periodic basis to ensure that the site ratings stay current and publishers are also reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of our internal audit. The rating system for website content is based on the following broad groupings:<br></li><li>
<ul>
<li>(a) All Audiences: defined as appropriate for all segments of the general public (all of the following must apply): no profanity, sexual content, violence depictions of alcohol, tobacco, weapons, gambling or drug use.</li>
<li>(b) Everyone Over 12 years: defined as may contain material considered inappropriate for young children. Any of the following may be present: implicit references to vulgar language, kissing, violence to animated characters, journalistic references to alcohol, tobacco, weapons, gambling, or drug use.</li>
<li>(c) Mature Audiences: defined as may contain material suitable only for mature audiences. Any of the following may be present: profanity, provocative images, nudity, violence to human beings or animals, depictions of alcohol, tobacco, weapons, gambling or drug use, etc.</li>
</ul><br>
</li><li>2) Burst’s website eligibility requirements exclude websites from joining our networks that:<br></li>
<li>(a) Contain any adult, nudity, sexually explicit, or mature content, use explicit language, or link to adult or sexually explicit content.</li>
<li>(b) Contain UGC that is not moderated.</li>
<li>(c) Infringe on any material protected by copyright.</li>
<li>(d) Distribute or promote spyware or malware.</li>
<li>(e) Contain racial, ethnic, political or hate mongering.</li>
<li>(f) Contain investment advice, or money-making opportunities not permitted under law.</li>
<li>(g) Contain gratuitous displays of violence or profanity.</li>
<li>(h) Contain material that defames, abuses, or threatens physical harm.</li>
<li>(i) Contain promotion of illegal substances or activities, such as online gambling, how to build a bomb, counterfeit money, etc.</li>
<li>(j) Contain email or chat services provided to users.</li>
<li>(k) Contain forum pages that are not moderated.</li>
<li>(l) Contain pages/sites which provide free hosting, community, or network services.</li>
<li>(m) Use any methods to falsely inflate the number of ad views or clicks.</li>
<li>(n) Allow timed rotation or auto refresh advertising.</li>

</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
	<strong>Data Disclosure</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>1) Burst reassures advertisers and agencies that the data collected for targeting purposes on their campaign has been done so in a transparent manner with the publisher's full permission. For off-site behavioural targeting of advertisers, Burst has contractual agreements with publishers in which consent is explicitly given to aggregate behavioural data for the purposes of using this information for behavioural targeting of advertisers off the publisher’s site.<br><br></li>
<li>2) If we use third-party data from a data aggregator for targeting, we will make available to the advertiser a list of data aggregators that may be used for their campaign but not specific to each campaign. Burst is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and will only work with NAI Approved 3rd Party Data aggregators. Additionally in those instances when Burst is using third-party data we will utilize Evidon InForm™. Evidon Inform is a service that gives consumers more transparency into and control over how their information is used online, including the ability to opt out of further targeting.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p>
<strong>Compliance</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>To maintain our self-certification through compliance with the IAB Guidelines, a quarterly internal audit is conducted by our Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer is a senior manager who is in an objective role, outside the influence of sales. Internal audits ensure that:<br><br></li>
<ul>
<li>1) The guidelines are consistently and completely followed.<br><br></li>
<li>2) That error situations are detected in a timely fashion.<br><br></li>
<li>3) That appropriate corrective measures are taken in a timely fashion.<br><br></li>
<li>4) Internal audits also include a risk analysis of certain control functions to assess how much testing should be conducted to validate adherence.<br><br></li>
<li>5) Internal audits include actual testing of data (sites/pages/ads/logs), both statistically and judgmentally based, to validate that the existing control structure is effective.<br><br></li>
</ul>
<li>On an annual basis, both our Compliance Officer and our CEO file an affidavit with the IAB attesting to the following:<br><br></li>
<ul>
<li>1) That quarterly internal audits have been conducted.<br><br></li>
<li>2) That inventory is accurately labeled in accordance with established content framework among four criteria:<br><br></li>
<ul>
<li>(a) Source level transparency</li>
<li>(b) Source relationship transparency</li>
<li>(c) Site/content level transparency</li>
<li>(d) Placement details transparency<br></li>
</ul>
<li>3) That content is accurately categorized in accordance with Tiers 1 &amp; 2 of the IAB Contextual Taxonomy, and that we specify the depth (e.g., site level vs. page level) of categorization.<br><br></li>
<li>4) That content is accurately labeled in accordance with established guidelines.<br><br></li>
<li>5) That we gain publisher consent from publisher partners who are contributing data for off-site behavioral targeting and we make available a list of
Third-party Data aggregators to advertisers when using Third-party data.<br></li>

<strong>Data Adjustment</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>adConductor utilizes multiple methods to ensure the accuracy of click counts. Checks are made for repeated and stale clicks, and for clicks from automated programs, such as spiders and bots. The checks are performed both when the clicks occur and during the summarization process. Clicks determined to be inauthentic are excluded from reporting and are advertisers are not charged for them. Additional analysis is performed to determine the source and cause of inauthentic clicks, which can lead to the suspension of offending publisher sites and blocking of users and IP addresses.<br><br></li>
<li>“Uniques” are determined by summing distinct views and clicks by user, adcode, campaign, package, creative and ad server. The user is identified by the “TID” value stored in the browser cookie, if available, otherwise the combination of the user’s IP address, and browser user agent and language is used.<br><br></li>
<li>This method of counting uniques means that if a user views the same campaign creative on a different adcode, or on the same adcode, but a different ad server, the view will be counted as an additional “unique”. Also, in the absence of a TID, if the user’s IP address changes, additional views or clicks on the same adcode, campaign creative and ad server would be counted as an additional unique. Conversely, in the absence of a TID, if multiple users from the same IP address having the same browser and language views or clicks on the same adcode, campaign creative and ad server they would be counted as a single unique.</li>
