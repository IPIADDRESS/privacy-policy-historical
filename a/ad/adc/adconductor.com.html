<h1 style="margin:0;">BURST MEDIA PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>

<strong><h3>Effective date: 12/1/2011</h3></strong>

<p style="margin:0;"></p><div style="float:left; width:600px;">Fundamentally, the privacy of web users must be protected and the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine their data to the site level. Burst Media as well as AdConductor collect no personally identifiable data, and therefore, protect user privacy. Burst's TRUSTe license verifies this privacy stance.</div>

<h2 style="margin:0;">TRUSTe</h2>

<p>Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to Burst Media and AdConductor, our web publisher members, and our advertiser clients. Our reputation and integrity are directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find a description below of how Burst and AdConductor strives to protect the privacy of Internet users and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.</p>


<h2>FOR THOSE WHO VIEW AN AD ON A SITE LICENSING OUR AdConductor TECHNOLOGY</h2>

<h3>The Cookie Principle</h3>

<p>AdConductor may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the purpose of identifying your web browser. When you are served an AdConductor ad, AdConductor may assign in a cookie various information on ads you've seen, information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.</p>

<p>AdConductor collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of: 1) analyzing campaign results, 2) ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and 3) preventing fraud across our sites.</p>

<p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site or our member sites. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Measurement Services</h3>

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The information collected can include:

    <ol>
    <li>Date/time of your visit</li>
    <li>The banner ad that was shown</li>
    <li>Unique user ID</li>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
    <li>The URLs of sites you visit</li>
    </ol>

<p>This information can also be used for online preference marketing ("profiling") purposes. In these instances, Burst has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned.</p>
