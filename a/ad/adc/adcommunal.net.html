		in order to better understand how the information you provide to us and 
		that we may otherwise collect may be used. If you have any queries 
		relating to this policy, please do not hesitate to contact us at
		<a href="mailto:info@adcommunal.com">info@adcommunal.com</a> . By 
		accessing the Site, you are consenting to the information collection and

		OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE

		Please note that our privacy policy changes from time to time, and the 
		changes are effective upon posting. Please check back frequently for 
		updates as it is your sole responsibility to be aware of changes. Ad 
		Communal Inc. does not provide any notices of changes in any manner

		<br>
		IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE 
		ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY PROVIDED ON THIS SITE, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY 
		INFORMATION TO AD COMMUNAL INC. OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS 
		OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY 
		POLICY.<br>
		<br>
		When you register and start using any of our sites located at 
		www.AdCommunal.com (the "Site"), we require relevant program 
		information, including but not limited to log-in, contact, company, 
		website, website user and payment data in order to manage your account 
		and provide you with the services requested. In addition once you are a 
		member of Ad Communal Inc., we require sales and earnings data, and we 
		collect performance statistics related to your Ad Communal Inc. 
		affiliate program(s) in order to properly compensate our users. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Contacting us with a question:</b> When you contact us with a 
		question or suggestion, we may collect your name, e-mail address and any 
		comments you have. We only use this information to respond to and/or 
		resolve your question or concern.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Information collected by Cookies and Web Beacons, etc.</b><br>
		<br>
		(a) Ad Communal uses cookies to enable you to sign in to certain 
		services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a 
		small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Some 
		cookies are used only to assist you with your session on a Website – 
		such cookies expire automatically after you terminate your session. Ad 
		Communal also uses cookies to improve the sign-in experience on certain 
		Websites. For example, your user ID may be stored in a cookie that will 
		remain on your computer after you terminate your session. This cookie 
		allows your user ID to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to 
		type your password the next time you sign in. Finally, Ad Communal may 
		place a cookie on your hard disk on behalf of a sponsor when such 
		sponsor’s web page is shown, so that the sponsor can measure the 
		effectiveness of such web page. Cookies cannot be used to run programs 
		or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be accessed or 
		read by the domain that placed them. You have the ability to accept or 
		decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you 
		can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you 
		prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in 
		or use certain features of a Website that depend on cookies. <br>
		<br>
		(b) Web Beacons: <br>
		A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image 
		on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user 
		identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired 
		information about an individual in a database. This allows AD COMMUNAL 
		INC. to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track 
		AD COMMUNAL INC. behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine 
		products or services with which you may be interested. In addition to 
		using web beacons on web pages, AD COMMUNAL INC. also uses web beacons 
		in email messages sent to individuals listed in AD COMMUNAL INC.'s 
		database.<br>
		<br>
		(c) IP Addresses: <br>
		AD COMMUNAL INC. automatically tracks certain information based upon 
		your behavior on the Site. We may use this information to do internal 
		research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better 
		understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information 
		may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the 
		site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site 
		or not), your computer browser information, and your Internet Protocol 
		address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique Internet 
		"address" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider 
		("ISP"). For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an 
		IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP 
		addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting 
		information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does 
		not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the 
		ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP 
		address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting 
		from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have 
		IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and 
		their pages.<br>
		<br>
		(d) Computer Profiles: <br>
		AD COMMUNAL INC. may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data 
		which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our 
		visitors. For instance, AD COMMUNAL INC. may accumulate visitor data 
		relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating 
		system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser 
		plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords 
		and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal 
		Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.<br>
		<br>
		(e) New Technology: <br>
		The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web 
		beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, AD COMMUNAL INC. strongly 
		encourages individuals to revisit this Privacy Policy for any updates 
		regarding its use of new technology. <br>
		<br>
		(f)Third party vendors including DoubleClick and Google, show our ads
		and advertiser's ads on sites on the internet
		Third party vendors, including DoubleClick and Google, use cookies to
		serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this website.
		Users may opt out of Third party, DoubleClick or Google's use of
		cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative opt out page, the </a><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx" target="_blank">DoubleClick opt-out page</a> or the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">Google
