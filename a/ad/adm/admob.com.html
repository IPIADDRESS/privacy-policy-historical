<p><strong>Effective Date -- May 1, 2006</strong></p>

<p>This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") covers the Website www.admob.com
 (the "Site"), owned and operated by AdMob, Inc.
 ("Company", "we", "us",
 "our").  Your privacy is important to us and we appreciate your expectation
 that we will share information about you carefully and responsibly. This
 Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to your or your
 company's personally identifiable information. Specifically, this Privacy
 Policy sets forth (i) the types of personal information collected by
 Company, (ii) how Company collects user information, (iii) how Company uses
 personal information, (iv) how Company protects personal information,
 (v) with whom, if anyone, user information is shared, and (vi) how you may
 access, verify, and if necessary, correct personal information Company has
 collected about you. By visiting the Site and/or using the Company services,
 you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the
 terms of the Privacy Policy, you may not access the Site or otherwise use
 the Company services.</p>

<p>If you have any concern about privacy on the Site, please send an email to
 privacy-at-admob-dot-com and we will try to resolve it.</p>

<p><strong>What Personal Information Does Company Collect?</strong></p>

<p>We collect the following types of personal information from our users:</p>

<p>A) Information You Provide to Us</p>

<ul>
<li>We receive and store personal information you choose to enter on the Site,
 or provide us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail.
 For example, when you register for our services, we collect personal
 information about you. This information may include your name, address, 
e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card number. We may combine the
 information we collect from you with information about you that we receive
 from other online and offline sources, such as from our merchant partners, in
 order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of
 the Company services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity
 to opt out of our combining of such information. In addition, if you
 voluntarily complete a detailed publisher or advertiser questionnaire, we
 collect personal information about you. This information may include your
 name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number, as well as general
 information about your business. In general, the more information you feel
 comfortable giving us, the more we can customize the Site and Company
 services to meet your needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>B) Automatic Information</p>

<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's
 hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your
 browser and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by
 how many people.  Our cookies do not collect personal information, and we do
 not combine information collected through cookies with other personal
 information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address
 is.  The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will
 direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
 command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
 fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies
 activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of
 the Site's most attractive features.</li>
<li>We automatically receive and store certain other types of information
 whenever you interact with us.  For example, our servers track the type of
 Web browser you are using, where you travel within the Site, and the page
 to which you link from the Site. If you are a publisher using Company's
 services, Company may access, index, and cache requests made from your
 mobile sites, applications and device platforms to our system, including by
 automated means.  Generally, our service automatically collects usage
 information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site and
 its components.  This data is only used in the aggregate.  This type of
 collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of
 the Site, so we can make the Site and Company services appealing to as
 many customers as possible.</li>
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Websites anonymously.
  While Company will not be able to provide you with a personalized
 experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these
 programs are available</li>
<li>When your customers connect to the Company services on their mobile
 device, if their mobile phone service provider uniquely identifies the
 device, Company will receive this information. Company may use this unique
 mobile device identification information to offer these customers extended
 services and/or functionality. Certain Company services may require our
 collection from your customers of the phone number, and/or other unique
 identifiers, for their device. We may associate that phone number to the
 mobile device identification information and to other information we have
 collected from and about these customers; however we will not use that
 number for telemarketing. Some mobile phone service providers are required
 to operate a system that will record the physical location of devices that
 use their service. Depending on the mobile phone service provider, Company
 may automatically receive this information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Does Company Use the Personal Information it Receives?</strong></p>

<p>In addition, as noted above, we use the information we collect to better
 understand what products and services are of interest to our users. To this
 end, we may use personally identifiable information in an aggregate form to
 gain a broader perspective of what preferences our users have, and to measure
 interest in the various areas of the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Does Company Share the Personal Information it Receives?</strong></p>

<p>Company does not share your personal information except as approved by you
 or as described below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Agents and Service Providers: Company may engage other companies and
 individuals to perform services on our behalf. Examples of these services
 include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and e-mail to
 you, and analyzing data. While these agents and service providers may have
 access to your personal information in connection with the performance of
 services for Company, they may not use such information for any purpose other
 than providing such services to Company.</li>
<li>Protection of Company and Others: We release account and other personal
 information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the
 law; enforce or apply our User Agreement; or protect the rights, property, or
 safety of Company, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
 information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
 credit risk reduction.</li>
<li>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell
 all or certain of our assets or business. In such transactions, your
 personal information may be one of the transferred business assets.</li>
<li>Aggregate Information:  Company may share aggregate personal information
 about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and
 other third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Secure Is the Personal Information I Provide?</strong></p>

<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your
 personal information during transmission, which encrypts the information you
 input. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple
 precautions. For instance, you should protect against unauthorized access
 to your Site username and password and to your computer. You should also
 be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. We have taken
 certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps to safeguard
 and secure the information we collect from our users and store on our
 servers.</p>

<p><strong>What Information Can I Access?</strong></p>

<p>Upon your request, we will provide you with access to, and the ability to
 correct, certain information about you, such as your username and password,
 contact information, transaction information and credit card account
 information. You can access or correct this information in the Account
 section of the Site.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Websites</strong></p>

<p>The Site may permit you to link to other Websites on the Internet, and
 other Websites may contain links to the Site.  These other Websites are not
 under our control.  The privacy and security practices of Websites linked

 not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of
 such Websites.</p>

 privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement, including
 limitations on damages and application of California state law.</p>

<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>

<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion.
  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect
 at the time such information is used.  If we make changes to the Privacy
 Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you
 are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
 what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
