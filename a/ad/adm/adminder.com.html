<b>IP Addresses</b><br><br>

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our web server, and for the general administration
of our website. Your IP address, should you decide to become a registered user of AdMinder, is also
used to prevent you from registering twice due to temporary technical problems. Finally, your IP
address may also be used to help verify that you are who you say you are.<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b><br><br>

Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file
that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however, in no
way does this tell us who you are. AdMinder.com has two primary uses for its cookies.<br><br>

First, we use them to track special offers and promotions that are made available to you so that you
do not see the same special offer and/or promotion each time you visit our website. Secondly, we also
use cookies to track referring web sites.<br><br>

While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have
the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept
cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.<br><br>

<b>Information Gathering</b><br><br>

This web site collects contact information in various ways, including inquiry forms, registration
forms, surveys, and contests. The information collected may be used to send the user information
about our company, or to get in touch with the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving
future mailings; see the opt-out/modify section below. Financial information (such as a credit
card number) is used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as
social security and/or Tax ID numbers) are collected for tax-reporting purposes if applicable.<br><br>

<b>Information Dissemination</b><br><br>

None of the information that is collected by this web site is rented, sold, or shared with any 3rd
parties for any purpose -- except in the case of unique identifiers (such as social
security and Tax Id numbers) which are provided to the IRS for tax-reporting purposes if applicable.<br><br>

<b>Security</b><br><br>

This web site has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information
that you provide. When making a purchase from this web site, your personal and financial information
(such as your credit card number) are protected by the industry-standard Secure Socket Layer protocol.
Furthermore, we have taken every precaution that is technically possible to prevent any unauthorized
access to the contents of this web server.<br><br>

<b>Opt-Out/Modify</b><br><br>

AdMinder.com provides every user with the opportunity to easily opt-out of receiving
future communications from us, change and modify information previously provided, or remove their
information from our databases altogether. You may do so in the following ways:<br><br>

1. Email: <a href="mailto:support@adminder.com">support@adminder.com</a><br>

The Internet is an online community that allows unparalleled access to knowledge,
worldwide communication, and commerce. Community is built on trust and inherent
in trust is the concept of your right to privacy -- and the Internet is no different.
According to the <a href="http://www.truste.org/partners/" target="privacy">Privacy
Partnership</a>, you have the right to choose what information you want to access
or share, and to know what will happen to that information once divulged. This
site adheres to this pledge.<br>
