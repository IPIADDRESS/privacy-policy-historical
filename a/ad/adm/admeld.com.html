  <h2>Privacy Policy
  </h2><br>
  <p><strong>Effective:</strong> July 1, 2009<br>
    <strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2010</p><br>
  <p>We, AdMeld Inc. ("AdMeld"), provide our customers
    (i.e. web publishers) with a set of technologies and services designed to help
    them maximize their ad revenues. The primary way we do this is by connecting our
    customers with a variety of ad buyers and, through our ad optimization
    technology ("Technology"), enabling them to make intelligent decisions about
    how they sell their ad inventory.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes AdMeld's privacy practices as
    they pertain to (i) our Technology, and (ii) our corporate website located at
    www.admeld.com (our "Site").</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please
    contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>1. Technology </h3>
  <p>Our customers use our Technology to determine which buyer
    will pay them the most to fill ad inventory located on their web sites and
    applications. As a result, you may encounter our Technology when you visit our
    customers' web sites and applications and view a page in which they have
    enabled our Technology. We also provide performance reporting to our customers,
    partners, and buyers regarding their use of our Technology. </p>
  <p><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b><br>
    We have no use for Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and we take all
    precautions to avoid receiving PII from our customers and partners. PII is data
    that can be used directly, or with reasonable effort, indirectly, to contact or
    identify you, and may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number,
    email address and home address. Due to the nature of the Internet, however,
    we cannot completely control the type of information they may send to our
    servers. If we are made aware that we received PII, we will use all efforts to
    remove that information from our records. In addition, if we are made aware
    that we have inadvertently passed PII to our customers or partners, we will use
    all efforts to ensure they remove that information from their records. </p>
  <p><b>AD TAGS</b><br>
    Our customers deploy our Technology by placing our ad tags on their web sites
    and applications, and such ad tags are used to deliver ads from buyers. Ad tags
    usually contain anonymous information about the web site, section of the site
    and size of the ad that we are optimizing. </p>
  <p><b>COOKIES</b><br>
    Our Technology stores a persistent cookie in your browser that contains only Non-Personally
    Identifiable Information ("Non-PII"). Most Internet browsers automatically
    accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop
    accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
    visit. We do not use cookies to retrieve PII from your computer. You can also opt-out of receiving cookies from our Technology.
    <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">Get more information about cookies and web beacons</a>.</p>
  <p><b>OPTING OUT</b><br>
    You can opt-out from having us collect your Non-PII in connection with our
    Technology. The opt-out process will place an opt-out cookie on your computer.
    The opt-out cookie tells our Technology not to collect your Non-PII and to
    avoid writing another cookie to your computer. Please note that if you delete,
    block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or
    Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.admeld.com/opt-out.html"><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Click here to opt out</strong>.</a></p>
  <p><b>COLLECTION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</b><br>
    Our Technology collects and uses Non-PII such as the IP address you use to
    access the Internet, the type of browser you are using, which and how many web
    pages you have viewed, the date and time your browser requested an ad, and how
    many ads your browser requested. </p>
  <p>We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with our
    customers and partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our
    Technology with Non-PII collected from our customers and partners. This
    information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.<br>
    <br>
    Please be aware that the web sites of our customers as well as the web sites
    linked through the ads delivered as a result of our Technology may collect
    information from you. Such information may include Non-PII through the use of cookies
    and other technology and any PII you may choose to give in registering and
    transacting with such web sites. Although we choose our business partners and
    clients carefully, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites
    operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy
    policies of such web sites you visit to determine how they handle any
    information they collect from you.</p>
  <p>Our Technology interfaces with the following entities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Our Customers' Web Sites<br>
    </b>In some cases, our customers can choose to use our ad
    tags to pass information to buyers about you, such as demographic information
    you have previously volunteered to them (for example, during the registration
    process) so long as they have the right to use this information for ad selection.
    Our policy forbids such information to be PII, and if we are made aware that we
    were unknowingly passed PII, we will purge such information from our servers
    and request that such customer cease sending us such information.&nbsp; We are
    not responsible for the privacy practices of these web sites and you should
    check the applicable privacy policies of such web sites you visit to determine
    how they handle any information they collect from you.
    </li>
    <li><b>Ad Buyers<br>
    </b>The ads delivered as a result of our Technology are
    served by third parties that may use their own cookies and/or other data
    collection tools. In addition, the ads themselves may also contain links to
    other websites with their own cookies and/or other data collection tools.
    </li>
    <li> <b>Third Party Data Providers<br>
    </b>Third party data providers are companies that collect
    information about your behaviors through relationships with many of the web
    sites you visit. For example, many of them collect Non-PII about the content
    areas or pages of the web sites that you visit (e.g., "sports
    section" or "technology section"). We partner with many of these
    third parties to provide their data to our customers in aggregate and anonymous
    form. For example, if one of our customers learns that 25% of their audience is
    interested in sports, this helps them sell advertising more effectively. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <b>NETWORK ADVERTISING INITIATIVE (NAI)</b><br>
    Many of the buyers and third party data providers we work with are members of
    the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). You can <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">visit the NAI</a> site to learn
    more about the advertising practices of their members, and <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt-out of ad targeting
    based on their cookies</a>.</p>
  <p><b>RETENTION OF INFORMATION</b><br>
    We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 90 days. Aggregate
    reports generated from such data may be retained for a longer period.<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>2. Site Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>The corporate Site is intended primarily to offer
    information about us and the services we provide. <b><br>
    <br>
    COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</b><br>
    We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage our Site. A
    persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
    You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
    Internet browser's "help" file. Web beacons (also known as "1x1
    pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide
    a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message
    for the purpose of transferring data. <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">Get more information about cookies and
    web beacons</a>.</p>
  <p><b>COLLECTION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</b><br>
    We collect Non-PII from our Site, such as the pages you have visited and the
    type of web browser you are using for internal purposes such as improving the
    design and content of the Site to make it more user friendly.</p>
  <p>We collect PII from our Site when you choose to provide it
    to us. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone
    number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send us PII about
    yourself in an email or by completing an online form on our Site. We use this
    information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, we
    will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The
    information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal
    course of business.</p>
  <p><b>THIRD PARTY WEB SITES</b><br>
    Our Site may contain links to other web sites. Such web sites may use cookies
    and/or other data collection tools. We are not responsible for the privacy
    practices, policies or content of such other web sites. We encourage everyone
    to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to
    learn more about the privacy practices of that website. We have no control over
    the use of information by third party web sites, and you should exercise
    caution when deciding to disclose any PII to those web sites.</p>
  <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES </b><br>
    We do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Site with non-affiliated
    third parties without your consent. </p>
  <p><b>UPDATING/DELETING YOUR PII</b><br>
    If you'd like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any PII that you
    have provided to us on this Site, please send your request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a> and we will process
    your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.<b><br>
    <br>
    </b></p>
  <h3>3. General</h3>
  <p><b>INFORMATION SECURITY </b><br>
    The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented
    reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both
    during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited
    to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
    method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we
    strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we
    cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about our security practices,
    please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>. </p>
  <p><b>INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN<br>
    </b>We are very sensitive to the issue of privacy rights of children, and we do
    not knowingly collect PII from children. If we are made aware that we have
    received PII from children, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that
    information from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and you become
    aware that your child has provided us with PII without your consent, please
    contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>.</p>
  <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES </b><br>
    We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we
    are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take
    action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not
    limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical
    safety of any person.</p>
  <p>Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII
    collected via our Site, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate
    merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>
  <p><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY </b><br>
    We may amend this privacy policy from time to time as we add new products and
    services, as we improve our current offerings, and as technologies change. If we
    make any material or substantive changes in the way that we use the PII
    collected through our Site, we will post a clear and conspicuous notice of
    those changes on our Site and in this privacy policy.</p>
