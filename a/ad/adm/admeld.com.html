<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> July 1, 2009<br>
  <strong>Last updated: </strong>September 11, 2009<strong><br>
  </strong></p>
  
  <p>AdMeld Inc. ("AdMeld") provides web publishers with a set of  technologies and services designed to help them more effectively monetize  their advertising inventory through ad networks and exchanges. <br><br>

  This Privacy Policy describes AdMeld's  privacy practices as they pertain to  (i) our ad optimization  technology ("Technology"), and (ii) visitors to our corporate website  located at www.admeld.com (our "Site").<br><br>

  If you have any questions about this  Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>.</p><br>

 <h3><strong>1. Technology Privacy Policy</strong> </h3><br>
     <p><br>
    <strong>Overview of AdMeld's Technology</strong> <br>
AdMeld's Technology does not serve ads, it decides which ad  networks or exchanges should serve ads on our publisher customer's websites. Generally,  your may encounter our Technology when you visit our customer's websites and  view a page in which the publisher has enabled our Technology.<br>
<br>
<strong>What information is collected?</strong><br>
AdMeld's Technology does not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). Our Technology does collect and use  Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of  browser used, which and how many publisher web pages have been viewed, the date and time an ad was requested, and how  many ads were requested.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
AdMeld's Technology stores a cookie on your computer hard  drive with Non-PII that it uses to keep track of the number of ads you have  viewed on our customers' websites. This frequency data is stored not in the  cookie itself, but in AdMeld's servers. This data is cleared from our servers every 90 days.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can  instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or  prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. You can also <a href="#opt">opt-out</a> of recieving cookies from AdMeld's Technology.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ad Tags</strong><br>
AdMeld's customers activate our Technology by placing our ad tags on  their websites. Ad tags usually contain information about the website, section  of the site and size of the ad that AdMeld is optimizing. In some cases, a web  publisher can choose to use our ad tags to pass Non-PII information to networks and exchanges  about you, such as demographic information you have previously volunteered to  the website (for example, during the registration process) so long as the  website has the right to use this information for ad selection. <br>
<u><br>
</u>AdMeld is a technology vendor to our customers and we take all  necessary precautions to avoid receiving PII from our clients. Due to the  nature of the Internet, however, we cannot completely control the type of  information a client may send to AdMeld's servers, or prevent a client from  sending PII. <br>
<br>
<strong>Third Party Links and Websites</strong> <br>
The ads delivered as a result of our Technology  are served by third parties that may use their own cookies and/or other data  collection tools. In addition, the ads themselves may also contain links to  other websites with their own cookies and/or other data collection tools. AdMeld  is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such  third parties and websites. <br>
<br>
AdMeld encourages everyone interacting with ads  from any source to learn more about the privacy practices of those serving it. AdMeld  has no control over the use of any information by third party and/or websites,  and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, AdMeld  does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data  collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party,  including those of our partners, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use  of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.</p>
     <p>Many of the third party networks and exchanges we work with are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). You can <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">visit the NAI</a> site to learn more about the advertising practices their members, and  opt-out of  ad targeting based on their cookies <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Storage of Non-PII</strong> <br>
       We retain the Non-PII collected via our  Technology for up to 90 days in order to ensure that our Technology is  functioning properly. </p>
