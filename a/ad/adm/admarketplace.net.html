			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Personal Information Collected on this Website</span><br>

			We do not merge any of the personally-identifiable information collected via our contact form with other anonymous data collected on our website. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Anonymous Information Collected on this Website</span><br>
			We record anonymous data such as traffic logs, number of visits or clicks on a given page, pages viewed or links to our site. We use IP addresses and cookies for gathering website statistics.

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cookies</span><br>
			We use cookies on this website. 
			<br><br>
			Cookies are small chunks of data created by a web server, delivered through a web browser, and stored on your computer. They provide a means for websites that you visit to keep track of your online patterns and preferences, as well as identify you as a return visitor.

			<h3>Network Privacy Policy</h3>
			adMarketplace's network targets ads to consumers who visit our publisher's websites. adMarketplace does not track or maintain PII (personally identifiable information) about consumers. We may obtain anonymous information like behavior of a particular user, for example, visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, demographic data and browser type etc. by using cookies, web beacons, pixels and IP addresses. 
			<ul>
				<li>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows adMarketplace to identify your IP address.  adMarketplace may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements.</li>
				<li>A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page.  This allows adMarketplace to determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes.</li>
				<li>Pixels can be placed on advertisers' pages in order to track when a sale is completed.  This helps adMarketplace target future ad placements, but no PII is obtained.</li>
				<li>adMarketplace may use your IP address to better target ads. Unless you use a static IP address, an IP address relates to households or larger communities. adMarketplace uses IP addresses to track where clicks are coming from and helps us fight click fraud, but no PII is obtained.</li>
				<li>Information can be collected directly from adMarketplace advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that adMarketplace works with.</li>
				<li>adMarketplace may set a cookie on your computer or associate behavior with your Internet service provider's IP address when you view advertisements delivered on publisher websites. After a behavior is associated to a cookie or an IP address, adMarketplace may track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher website.</li>
			</ul>
			adMarketplace may lawfully receive information about you, including demographic data, purchasing trends and similar information, from third parties, such as information located in public databases.
			<p></p>
			<br><br>
			
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Use of Information and Data</span><br>
			adMarketplace may share anonymous information about your behaviors with trusted publishers under confidentiality agreements. These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements to you. 
			<br><br>
			adMarketplace stores anonymous information in a database.  This database is password protected and secure.  adMarketplace maintains the data in an encrypted form, so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format.  This data is stored for up to two months and then moved to our secure archive server.  The data is encrypted and password protected and only accessed  to resolve a legal or business issue. adMarketplace cannot guarantee that its security or privacy protection measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed and the data stolen. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Privacy Practices of Third Parties</span><br>
			Publishers who place advertisements on the internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about you. adMarketplace does not control publishers' use of such technology. 
			<br><br>
			To learn about how a particular publisher may use your PII or anonymous information, you should read the privacy policy of that publisher. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Opt-Out Information</span><br>
			To prevent adMarketplace from tracking your behavior on a website, turn off cookies, utilize a changing IP address, and do not click on or interact with any advertisements. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			
			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</span><br>

Notice of such amendments will be posted as an updated Privacy Policy on this website, and an effective date will be indicated.
