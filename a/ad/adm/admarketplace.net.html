We may obtain anonymous information like behavior of a particular user, for example, visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, geographic data and browser type etc. by using cookies, pixels and IP addresses.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows adMarketplace to identify your IP address. adMarketplace may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements.</li>
				<li>Pixels can be placed on advertisers' pages in order to track when a sale is completed. This helps adMarketplace target future ad placements, but no PII is obtained.</li>
				<li>adMarketplace may use your IP address to better target ads. Unless you use a static IP address, an IP address relates to households or larger communities. adMarketplace uses IP addresses to track where clicks are coming from and helps us fight click fraud, but no PII is obtained.</li>
				<li>Information can be collected directly from adMarketplace advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that adMarketplace works with.</li>
				<li>adMarketplace may set a cookie on your computer or associate behavior with your Internet service provider's IP address when you click on an advertisement delivered on publisher websites.

			<h4>Use of Information and Data</h4>
			<p>adMarketplace may share anonymous information about your behaviors with trusted publishers under confidentiality agreements. These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements to you.</p>
			<p>adMarketplace stores anonymous information in a database. This database is password protected and secure. adMarketplace maintains the data in an encrypted form, so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format. This data is stored for up to two months and then moved to our secure archive server. The data is encrypted and password protected and only accessed to resolve a legal or business issue. adMarketplace cannot guarantee that its security or privacy protection measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed and the data stolen.</p>
			<h4>Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h4>
			<p>Publishers who place advertisements on the internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about you. adMarketplace does not control publishers' use of such technology.</p>
			<p>To learn about how a particular publisher may use your PII or anonymous information, you should read the privacy policy of that publisher.</p>
