		<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
		
		<p>
		The following outlines the measures taken to protect your privacy by this website and by the AdwareMedic application. It is important to understand that our top priority is not just respecting your privacy, but helping you regain it by removing adware that is violating it.
		</p>
		
		<h2>This site</h2>
		
		<p>
		This site (and its parent site, The Safe Mac) collects no information about you beyond the data that all web servers collect in the course of normal operations (IP address, pages being loaded, etc). No personally identifying information is collected. There are also no cookies used by this site.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		When purchasing AdwareMedic, you will be directed to PayPal. PayPal is responsible for the personal information it collects. This site will never receive information such as your credit card information after a purchase, but will receive information such as the name, e-mail address and postal address provided to PayPal. This information will not be shared with anyone else, and The Safe Mac will never spam you or use your postal address in any way at all.
		</p>
		
		<h2>The AdwareMedic application</h2>
		
		<p>
		AdwareMedic does not collect information about you or transmit information anywhere automatically. When it is launched, it will contact www.adwaremedic.com twice: once to check for and download updates to the adware signatures, and once to check for updates to the app itself. When AdwareMedic scans for adware, the information on the adware detected is logged to your hard drive, but is not sent anywhere.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		AdwareMedic has a "System Snapshot" feature that gathers information about your system and creates a report from that information. This snapshot is only created when you request it by clicking the Take System Snapshot button. The snapshot is always displayed to you when it is complete, and is not sent anywhere unless you click the "Submit to The Safe Mac" button in the System Snapshot window. If you choose to click that button, an e-mail message with the snapshot data will be created in Mail; you will then need to click the Send button in Mail before the data is sent.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		System snapshots that are sent to The Safe Mac are never shared with anyone. They may be kept for future reference, since improving the adware signatures used by AdwareMedic depends in part on the data collected from these snapshots.
		</p>
