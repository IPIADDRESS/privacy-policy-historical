We strive to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to all of our websites (unless a different privacy statement is specifically made applicable). By using an Adicio website, you consent to the policies and practices described in this Statement.</p><p>Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access an Adicio website outside the United States, your usage of that site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and into the United States. </p><p>Our sites contain links to other websites over which we have no control. Adicio is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from an Adicio website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to the information we collect on an Adicio website, and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.</p><h4>Collection and Retention of Information</h4><p>In some areas of our websites, Adicio requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible.</p><p>We also gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is collected by Adicio. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. </p><p> You can correct or update your Adicio account profile, resume(s) or application(s), or email alerts at any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume(s) or application(s) from Adicio's online database or close your account(s) at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of your resume or application if applicable and cover letters. Please refer to the section that follows labeled "Updating Your Information" if you need assistance.</p><h4>Email A Job To A Friend</h4><p>If you choose to email a job listing to tell a friend about a job opportunity, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email containing a link to the job listing, inviting him or her to visit the site that the job is posted on. Adicio does not store this information and does not track the success of whether or not the email is received.</p><p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adicio.com">privacy@adicio.com</a> if they have any questions on this process.</p><h4>Use of Information by Adicio</h4><p>We use the information we gather on an Adicio website, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Adicio website, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.</p><p>We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from Adicio.</p><p>We may use your contact information in order to send you email or other communications regarding updates at the Adicio site, such as new Adicio opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for Adicio, you have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information and promotions including without limitation free informational newsletters from Adicio relating to topics that may be of special interest to you. </p><h4>Disclosure of Information to Others</h4><p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of an Adicio website (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.</p><ol>  <li>We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for an Adicio account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, agents, brokers, dealers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you email or otherwise communicating with you.<br><br>  </li>  <li>We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.  <br><br></li>  <li>We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Adicio or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.<br><br>  </li>  <li>We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Adicio's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Adicio becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Adicio or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. If such event occurs we will display a prominent notice on our website.<br><br>  </li></ol><p>Adicio may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of our ASP Client's websites with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to Adicio's site and how those visitors use the site.</p><p>Adicio supplies technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment, real estate and motors areas on their websites (sometimes referred to as "private label areas"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in private label areas becomes part of the Adicio database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Adicio and the company concerned without your consent.</p><p>Information gathered on a page in a private label area, or on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Adicio and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both Adicio and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Adicio is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information. If you apply for a position through a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on your age, gender or race. Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements. You should understand that if provided, this information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making any employment decisions. All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.</p><h4>Use of Cookies</h4><p>Adicio uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Adicio pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the Adicio site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.</p><p>You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Adicio website. To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a website that does use cookies.</p><h4>Use of Web Beacons</h4><p>Adicio web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are hidden graphics or javascript that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on Adicio; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage.</p><p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.</p><h4>Automatic Collection</h4><p>For each HTTP (which is what your web browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from a website) request received, we collect and store only the following information:</p><ul>  <li>The date and time</li>  <li>The originating IP address</li>  <li>The type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser)</li>  <li>The URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)</li>  <li>The object requested</li>  <li>Completion status of the request</li>  <li>Pages visited</li>  <li>Cookies</li></ul><h4>How the Information is Used</h4><p>We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our sites more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs periodically to determine the traffic through our servers, the number of pages served, server load and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest.</p><h4>Updating Your Information</h4><p>You may review, correct, update or change your Adicio account information at any time. Simply log into your Adicio account, go to your Account Profile, review your account information and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided.</p><p>If you opted to receive newsletters, commercial emails or other communications from Adicio or third parties at the time you registered with Adicio, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your Account Profile as described above. If you previously opted not to receive such communications, you may later opt-in by editing your Account Profile.</p><h4>Security</h4><p>Adicio has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Adicio also uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the information on our websites. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on our websites is strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p><p>When you place an order online at Adicio, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. Adicio uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.
