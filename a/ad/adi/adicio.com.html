<h4>Disclosure of Information to Others</h4>

<p>
We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined
personal and demographic information or information about your use of a
Adicio Web site (such as the areas you visit or the services you
access), except as set forth below.
</p>

<ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such information
to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you
indicate that you would like to receive information about the products
or services of third parties at the time you register for a Adicio
account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such
as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the
purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such
information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions
on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing
data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments,
and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will
have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their
functions, but they may not share that information with any other third
party.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose such
information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a
governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is
necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal
process; (b) protect the rights or property of Adicio or its
affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security;
or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">We may disclose and transfer
such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial
portion of Adicio's business, whether such acquisition is by way of
merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of
our assets. In addition, in the event Adicio becomes the subject of
a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Adicio
or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of
such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court if
such even occurs we will display a prominent notice on our web site.<br><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Adicio may also share aggregated anonymous information about
visitors to each of our ASP Client's Web sites with its clients,
partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds
of visitors to Adicio's site and how those visitors use the site.
</p>
<p>
Adicio supplies technology, hosting and related services to other
leading companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites
(sometimes referred to as "private label recruitment areas"). Personal

recruitment areas becomes part of the Adicio database, but it is
not accessible by anyone other than you, Adicio and the company
concerned without your consent.
</p>
<p>
Information gathered on a page in a private label recruitment area, or
on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by
Adicio and another company), may become the property of the other
company or of both Adicio and the other company. In that instance,
the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the
privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Adicio is not
responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic
information. If you apply for a position through a co-branded site, you
may be asked to provide information on your age, gender or race. Some
employers are required by law to gather this information from job
applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements. You should
understand that if provided, this information will be used by employers
only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making
any employment decisions. All information provided will be kept
separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity.
Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be
subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide
this information.
</p>  

<h4>Use of Cookies</h4>

<p>Adicio uses "cookies" to help personalize
and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text
file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies
are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by
a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p>
<p>
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
personalize Adicio pages, or register for services, a cookie helps
us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and
preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and
more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you
return to the Adicio site, the information you previously provided
can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you
customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load
balancing.
</p>
<p>
You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively,
you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time
a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an
individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may
hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the
Adicio Web site. To protect your privacy, be sure to close your
browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a
website that does use cookies.
</p>  
<h4>Use of Web Beacons</h4>
<p>
Adicio Web pages may contain electronic
images known as Web beacons, which are hidden graphics or java script
that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to
deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your
personally identifiable information on Adicio; they are a technique
we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage
</p>
<p>
Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a
cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the
page on which the Web beacon resides.
</p>

<h4>Automatic Collection</h4>
<p>
For each HTTP (which is what your Web browser generates when you
request a page or part of a page from a Web Site) request received, we
collect and store only the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The date and time</li>
  <li>The originating IP address</li>
  <li>The type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser)</li>
  <li>The URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)</li>
  <li>The object requested</li>
  <li>Completion status of the request</li>
  <li>Pages visited</li>
  <li>Cookies</li>
</ul>

<h4>How the Information is Used</h4>

<p>We use the information that we collect to measure the number of
visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our
sites more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs
periodically to determine the traffic through our servers, the number
of pages served, server load and the level of demand for pages and
topics of interest.
</p>

<h4>Updating Your Information</h4>

<p>You may review, correct, update or change your Adicio account
information at any time. Simply log into your Adicio account, go to
your Account Profile, review your account information and, if you wish,
edit it with the options provided. 
</p>
<p>
If you opted to receive newsletters, commercial e-mails or other
communications from Adicio or third parties at the time you
registered with Adicio, but subsequently change your mind, you may
opt-out by editing your Account Profile as described above. If you
previously opted not to receive such communications, you may later
opt-in by editing your Account Profile.
</p> 

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>Adicio has implemented reasonable technical and organizational
measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental
loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
Adicio also uses software programs to monitor network traffic to
identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
otherwise cause damage to the information on our Web sites.
Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on
our Web sites is strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. However, we cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures
or use your personal information for improper purposes.
</p>
<p>
When you place an order online at Adicio, your credit card
information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your
credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being
transmitted. Adicio uses a service company to process its credit
card transactions. For further information on this company's privacy
and security practices. For further information on this company's

<p>
This ASP Privacy Policy applies only to all transfers of personally
identifiable information ("Personal Information") received by
Adicio, Inc. in any format through its hosted recruitment software,
Career Server, whether supplied directly by Adicio, Inc. customers
or by candidates for employment at Adicio, Inc. customers anywhere
in the world, including transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA)
to the United States. Any other visitors to Adicio.com should refer
to the On-Line Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP Adicio, Inc.com
website use. <a href="http://www.adicio.com/privacy_non_asp/" target="new">http://www.adicio.com/privacy_non_asp</a>
</p>
<p>
Adicio, Inc. abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by
the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of
data from the European Union. As such we operate as a data processor
for our hosted recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment
software customers fill the role of data controller. Individual users
involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with
Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc.
Adicio, Inc. provides its customers the option of disclosing their
relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and
candidates of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that
they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that information related to
the candidate recruitment process, which our customers' have asked us
to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy
practices of Adicio, Inc.'s customers and Adicio, Inc. is not
responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices.
Adicio, Inc. does not review, comment upon or monitor its
customers' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does
Adicio, Inc. review its customer instructions to determine whether
they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a customer's
published privacy policy.
</p>
<p class="subPara">
<b class="leftNum">1.</b><span class="titleBold">Notice/Use of Information</span><br>

it supplies a hosted system, Adicio, Inc. operates as a data
processor for our recruitment software customers. Our hosted

Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact
directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio,
Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers with the option of
disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual
employees and candidates of the customer about the Adicio, Inc.
technology that they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that
information related to the candidate recruitment process, which our
customers have asked us to process. It is the Adicio, Inc.
customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the customer collects
can be legally collected in the country of origin. The Adicio, Inc.
customer is responsible to give its employees and candidates for
employment the appropriate level of notification that Personal
Information is being collected and maintained. Adicio, Inc. does
collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an
individual candidate's Personal Information, and that may be used for
statistical analysis and training purposes.

<p class="subPara">
<b class="leftNum">2.</b><span class="titleBold">Notification of Changes/Choice</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>We
will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy.
If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this
page so that our recruitment software customers or their candidates for
employment are always aware of what information we process, how we use
it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any
point we decide to use Personal Information in a different manner, we
will notify our recruitment process customers by way of email or by
posting a notice on our website for at least 30 days prior to the
change in use. Customers, in turn, are responsible for notifying
candidates and providing them a choice as to whether or not we use
their information in this different manner.
</p>
<p class="subPara">
<b class="leftNum">3.</b><span class="titleBold">Onward Transfer</span><br>

employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples may include customer service; resume processing, and
data storage. If we disclose information of our customers or job
candidates to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our
behalf, we will ensure that the third party has agreed to abide by the
Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can
otherwise assure adequate protection of such information. We may seek
to assure adequate protection, for example, by entering into written
agreements with third parties requiring such parties to provide at
least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe
Harbor and/or the Data Directive.
</p>
<p class="subPara">
<b class="leftNum">4.</b><span class="titleBold">Data Integrity</span><br>
