<h2>Collection and Retention of Information</h2>
<p>In some areas of our websites, Adicio requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, contact information, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible.</p>
<p>We also gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access.

This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses.</p>
<p>You can correct or update your Adicio account profile, resume(s) or application(s), or email alerts at any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume(s) or application(s) from Adicio's online database or close your account(s) at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of your resume or application if applicable and cover letters.

<p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information with parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
<h2>Email A Job To A Friend</h2>
<p>If you choose to email a job listing to tell a friend about a job opportunity, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email containing a link to the job listing, inviting him or her to visit the site that the job is posted on. Adicio does not store this information and does not track the success of whether or not the email is received.</p>
<p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adicio.com">privacy@adicio.com</a> if they have any questions on this process.</p>
<h2>Use of Information by Adicio</h2>
<p>We use the information we gather on an Adicio website, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Adicio website, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.</p>
<p>We may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from Adicio.</p>
<p>We may use your contact information in order to send you email or other communications regarding updates at the Adicio site, such as new Adicio opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for Adicio, you have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information and promotions including without limitation free informational newsletters from Adicio relating to topics that may be of special interest to you.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Information to Others</h2>
<p>We do not disclose to third parties your personal information for promotional purposes, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of an Adicio website (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.</p>
<ol>
    <li>We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for an Adicio account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, agents, brokers, dealers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you email or otherwise communicating with you.</li>
    <li>We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.</li>
    <li>We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Adicio or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</li>
    <li>We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Adicio's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Adicio becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Adicio or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. If such event occurs we will display a prominent notice on our website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adicio may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to each of our ASP Client's websites with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to Adicio's site and how those visitors use the site.</p>
<p>Adicio supplies technology, hosting and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment, real estate and motors areas on their websites (sometimes referred to as "private label areas"). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in private label areas becomes part of the Adicio database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you, Adicio and the company concerned without your consent.</p>
<p>Information gathered on a page in a private label area, or on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Adicio and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both Adicio and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Adicio is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information. If you apply for a position through a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on your age, gender or race. Some employers are required by law to gather this information from job applicants for reporting and record keeping requirements. You should understand that if provided, this information will be used by employers only in accordance with applicable law and will not be used in making any employment decisions. All information provided will be kept separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information.</p>
