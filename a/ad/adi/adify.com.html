				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p><strong> Adify Corporation: Privacy Policy</strong> <br> Version 1.2 - August 2007  <br><br> Adify Corporation ("Adify") provides an online advertising sale and display service (the "Service") for Internet "Publishers". We enable "Advertisers" to place advertisements via the Service on one or more sites belonging to Publishers. We enable "Network Operators" to create and manage networks of Publishers and Advertisers using tools we provide. The Service runs on software developed and hosted by Adify, its subsidiaries, and third-party contractors. <br><br> Adify Corporation recognizes the importance of information privacy. This Privacy Policy describes Adify's practices for gathering, storing, using and disseminating information, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard that information. <strong>We may change this policy from time to time.</strong> All changes will be posted to this site, and you are encouraged to periodically check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy. <br><br> <strong>A. INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong> <br><br>You can browse certain areas of the Service without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For example, your user ID is displayed throughout the Service and is therefore available to the public. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers located in the United States. <br><br>If you are an Advertiser, Publisher, or Network Operator, Adify requests certain information related to your business, your website, and your use of the Service. Adify will collect and store this information. Adify may collect your email addresses, mailing and billing address and order information, IP address, information about your site, including but not limited to your site's page impressions, advertising prices and information about your visitors. <br><br> To improve and personalize the Service, Adify may collect information about your business from third parties and provide this information on your behalf. This information may include, but is not limited to the following: third-party counts of monthly page views, visitor composition, and rankings in various indices. Adify may not provide you the option to turn off the presentation of this information. <br><br>Adify may collect tax information, including Value Added Tax (VAT) or federal tax ID numbers. Adify will collect information regarding your activities with respect to the Service.
