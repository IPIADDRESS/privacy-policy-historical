We enable advertisers to place advertisements via the Service on one or more sites belonging to Publishers. We enable our corporate customers (“Network Operators”) to create and manage networks of Publishers and Advertisers using tools we provide. The Service runs on software developed and hosted by Adify, its subsidiaries, and third-party contractors.</p><p>Adify recognizes the importance of information privacy. This Privacy Policy describes Adify’s practices for gathering, storing, using and disseminating information, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard that information. We may change this policy from time to time. All changes will be posted to this site, and you are encouraged to periodically check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy.

INFORMATION COLLECTION</p><p>If you are a Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, you can browse certain areas of the Service without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.&nbsp; For example, your user ID is displayed throughout the Service and is therefore available to our employees and contractors&nbsp; If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer to and storage of that information on servers located in the United States. </p><p>If you are a Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, Adify requires certain information related to your business, your website, and your use of the Service. Adify will collect and store this information. Adify may collect your email addresses, mailing and billing address and order information, IP address, information about your site, including but not limited to your site’s page impressions, advertising prices, and information about your visitors.</p><p>To improve and personalize the Service, Adify may collect information about your business from third parties and provide this information on your behalf.&nbsp; This information may include, but is not limited to the following: third-party counts of monthly page views, visitor composition, and rankings in various indices. Adify may not provide you the option to turn off the presentation of this information.</p><p>Adify may collect tax information, including Value Added Tax (VAT) or federal tax ID numbers.

COOKIES </p><p>“Cookies” are small data files that may be downloaded to your computer when you visit the Adify site or a Publisher site and permit the Adify server to identify your browser whenever you interact with the Adify site or with an Adify Publisher site.

Adify may, as permitted by applicable law, disclose your personally identifiable information to Publishers, Advertisers, Network Operators, or third parties in connection with an investigation of fraud, infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity and you expressly authorize Adify to make such disclosures.</p><p>7) Contractors and Vendors. We use contractors and vendors, including information processing companies, to help with some of our operations. Some of these contractors will have access to our databases of Publisher, Advertiser, and Network Operator information on a temporary basis for specific tasks. Adify also uses vendors to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your User Information to them. For example, Adify may use a vendor to communicate with you (via telephone, e-mail, or letter) about your Service, to remit payments, to generate demographic profiles based on such information, to send out tax forms, and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. Adify contractually binds these contractors and vendors to use such information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.</p><p>8) Domestic and International Use. All personally identifying information collected by Adify may be used in the United States or, if the Service are undertaken by Adify for a non-US Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, such information may be transferred to that Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, outside of the United States, and through your use of the Service you hereby consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. </p><p>9) Merger or Acquisition.
