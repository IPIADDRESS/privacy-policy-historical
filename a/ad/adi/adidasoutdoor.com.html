			<h1>Protecting your Privacy</h1>

<p>agron, inc., Official Licencee for adidas, is the exclusive distributor for adidas outdoor in the United States of America. ("adidasoutdoor.com")
adidasoutdoor.com. ("adidas outdoor" "adidas" or "we", "us", or "our") is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information collected at or in connection with the adidasourdoor.com website. This Online Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies also to those adidas websites that display or link to this Policy (including adidas.com/us, miadidas.com/us, and adidas.com and referred to in this Policy as the "Website"). This Policy applies to data collected by adidas through its Websites and services that display these terms. It does not apply to those adidas sites, services and products that do not display or link to this Policy or that have their own privacy policies. This Policy describes the information we collect and how we use it. By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Website.</p>

<h3>Consent to Collection and Processing</h3>
<p>This Website may not be operated, in whole or in part, from a country other than the United States.</p>

<h3>What Information about me does adidasoutdoor.com collect and store?</h3>
<p>Our privacy policy is simple: Except as disclosed below, we don't sell, trade, give away, or rent your personal information to any company outside of the adidas Group. One of the basic principles we've tried to follow in designing this Website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. As a result, what information we collect and store depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Website and our services. Personal Information We collect and store information that you provide to our Website or our Customer Service Department. For example, when you open an account or place an order, we collect and store some or all of the following information that you provide: name, billing address, shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. We collect your e-mail addresses and zip code if you subscribe to our newsletter. You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located within each newsletter. Registration may be required and personal information collected in certain areas of the Website in which you specifically and knowingly provide such information, e.g. community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or customer service requests. When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Website, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed, if it is different than as described in this Policy. Personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us. Anonymous Information Through your use of our Website, we may also gather certain information that does not identify you individually ("Anonymous Information"). Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data". We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with our Website. For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit our Website. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve our Website and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.</p>

<h3>How does adidasoutdoor.com use cookies and spyware?</h3>
<p>We never use or install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer. Like many websites, we use "cookies", files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Website without checking out and send you reminder e-mail about your shopping orders and other shopping opportunities. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience. You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf to tailor advertisements shown to you for goods and services. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Website. Our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website enable you to opt out of this type of advertising. For more information about third party cookies, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>

<h3>Is Information collected from children?</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13.</p>

<h3>How does adidasoutdoor.com use your personal information?</h3>
<p>We may use your personal information to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, and to provide customer service. Your information also may be used to contact you about sales, new products, special offers, and new site features, unless you have opted to not receive promotional communications. The information we collect may be combined with information obtained from companies within the adidas Group and from other companies. Aggregating data allows adidas to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide you with product recommendations and special offers.</p>

<h3>How does adidasoutdoor.com share your personal Information?</h3>
<p>Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your personal information outside of adidas and the adidas Group without your consent. For further information about the companies within the adidas Group, please visit http://www.adidas-group.com. adidas Partners - Some adidas Websites allow you to choose to share your personal information with select adidas partners so that they can contact you about their products, services or offers.

<h3>How does adidasoudoor.com use anonymous information?</h3>
<p>We use Anonymous Information to help us determine how people use parts of the Website and who our readers are. This allows us to improve our Website and ensure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We also use Anonymous Information to provide statistical "ratings" information in aggregated form to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Website.</p>

<h3>What steps are taken to help secure personal information?</h3>
<p>An athlete can't play without confidence, and you shouldn't order from a company that doesn't follow secure data practices. Our goal is to deliver performance to you in every way. That includes security. Personal information collected at our Website is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Only those employees and service providers who need access to personal information in order to do their jobs are allowed access, each having confidentiality obligations. To protect the security of your information during transmission, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. For example, when using a credit card to make an on-line purchase, your personal information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction. Most browsers will give a visual indication of when your connection is secure. For example, Internet Explorer will show a padlock icon in the lower right of the browser window. If you place an order through our Website, you will be asked to set up an account and provide an e-mail address and password. In order to help protect your personal information, you should be careful about providing your password to others. If you wish to cancel your account, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password, please contact Customer Service. Please refer to the last section of this Policy (How to Contact Us) for more information. While we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
