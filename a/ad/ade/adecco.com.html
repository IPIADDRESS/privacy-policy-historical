		<h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<p>Latest Update: September 2018</p>
<p>Adecco Group AG, Bellerivestrasse 30, 8008 Zürich, Switzerland (“Adecco”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>This Policy (together with other documents referred to herein) describes what personal information we collect from you and how we process your personal information./</p><p>
		
		</p><h3>Personal information we may collect from you</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We will collect any information you provide to us when you use our contact forms (for example “Application form”) like name, phone number, email address, country and your resume or CV. The provision of your personal information via our contact forms is not a statutory or contractual requirement; however, please note that fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory fields, because we need this information to comply with or respond to your request.  </li>
			<li>Other information or personal information you share with us when completing our contact forms or attaching documents is in your sole discretion.  </li>
			<li>In some cases, we will also collect ‘sensitive personal information’ (This is information that gets special protection under our privacy laws. It is information about your race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, genetic or biometric details, sex life and details of any criminal convictions or similar you may be subject to) where we are permitted to do so by law (so in some countries we will ask you about your background for equal opportunities monitoring). Where you choose to give us so called ‘sensitive personal information’, by giving us that information, you agree that we may use it in the way set out in this Privacy Information Statement. </li>
			<li>If you contact us, we will keep a record of that correspondence. </li>
			<li>We will collect personal information on your visits to the Website including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs, content from surveys and contact forms and other communication data and the resources that you access. Our collection of this personal information will make your visit to the Website easier in the future as we will be able to suggest Content that is relevant to you based on the location you access the Website from.</li>
<li>We use your personal information to send you direct marketing via e-mail when you opt-in for this purpose in the relevant contact form. You may opt-out of receiving future marketing communications at any time.</li>
<li>We may also store cookies as set out in more detail in our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>How we use your information</h3>
		<ol>
<li>To provide you with the services you expect us to, like participating in the Davis Cup work experience according to terms and conditions stated in the site;</li>
<li>To find you suitable jobs/assignments to apply for, helping you with training, or facilitating the process of applying for jobs/assignments. This includes sending your CV to prospective employers for their consideration and keeping you informed of future work opportunities by email, telephone, mail and/or other communication methods; </li>
<li>to respond to your request or questions when you contact us.</li>
<li>to send to you other information – such as Adecco upcoming events or newsletters – that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li>to further develop, test and improve our website, or other existing or new systems/processes to better serve you; this mainly takes place in the context of new IT systems and processes, so that information about you may be used in the testing of those new IT systems and processes where dummy data cannot fully replicate the operation of that new IT system; </li>
<li>to perform studies and statistical and analytical research, for example to compare the effectiveness of our placement of candidates between different business sectors and geographies and seek to identify factors that might influence any differences we identify; </li>
<li>to transfer data to third parties (see below); </li>
<li>where necessary, to comply with any legal obligation; and</li>
<li>we may also process your information to: </li>

<ul>
<li>promote the security and protection of people, premises, systems and assets;</li>
<li>monitor compliance with internal policies and procedures;</li>
<li>administer communications and other systems used by the Adecco Group (including internal contact databases); </li>
<li>investigate or respond to incidents and complaints;</li>
<li>in the case of photos or videos of training sessions, to report internally that the training sessions have taken place and their content (for example in internal updates) and also to market similar sessions internally and externally to third parties;</li>
<li>comply with obligations and rights and cooperate with investigations carried out by the police, government or regulators; and</li>
<li>participate in any potential or actual purchase or sale, or joint venture, of all or part of a business or company, that any member of the Adecco Group wishes to participate in.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Our use of your information as described above is permitted by applicable data protection law because it is: </p>

<ul>
<li>necessary for our legitimate interests in pursuing the purposes set out above, and such interests in each case not being overridden by your privacy interests; </li>
<li>in some cases, necessary to meet our legal or regulatory responsibilities, such as disclosures to authorities, regulators or government bodies; or </li>
<li>in some cases, necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest and, when we use special categories of personal information, necessary for establishing. exercising or defending legal claims or where the processing relates to personal information manifestly in the public domain;</li>
<li>in limited circumstances, processed with your consent which we obtain from you from time to time, such as when you opt-in to receive marketing communications and news via email.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will keep your information for the longer of the period required in order to meet our legal or regulatory responsibilities. The retention periods of your personal information depend on the respective purpose the data are processed for and the respective tool such personal information are processed in. It is not possible to outline the various retention periods in a reasonably intelligible format under this Policy. The criteria used to determine the applicable retention period are that we will retain the personal information set out in this policy for as long as (i) necessary for the respective purpose, (ii) necessary to carry out our business relationship with you, (iii) you have consented to, and/or (iv) required by applicable statutory retention laws.</p>

<h3>Do you have to give us the personal information we ask for?</h3>

<p>You are not obliged to provide your personal information to us, but it is more or less impossible for us to work with you and provide our services if you do not.</p>

<h3>Do we process information about you without any human intervention at all?</h3>
<p>Yes we do at times. Adecco may use automated systems/processes and automated decision-making (like profiling) to provide you, and our clients, with the services you request from us. For example, when our clients are looking for candidates for jobs, we may conduct a search of our lists of candidates using automated criteria which takes into account your availability, skillset, pay rate and in some circumstances previous feedback we have received from clients to compile a shortlist which ranks which candidates are most likely to fulfil the client’s requirement. This means that sometimes your position in the rank may be higher than others, depending on how these factors match the clients needs.</p>

<h3>Sharing with third parties</h3>
<p>To facilitate our efficient use of your information, and to provide you with the content and/or resources, we disclose your information to third parties. However, this disclosure will only occur in the following circumstances:</p>


<p>To suppliers, contractors and agents. From time to time we may engage or employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. We may, for example, engage a supplier to carry out administrative and operational work in support of our relationship with you. The supplier(s) will be subject to contractual and other legal obligations to preserve the confidentiality of your data and to respect your privacy, and will only have access to the data they need to perform their functions; the relevant suppliers are typically IT suppliers (who host or support our IT systems, including information about you), premises management companies (who look after physical security at our buildings, and therefore may need to know about you to allow access to our buildings) and back office finance and accounting management providers (who might need to handle details of candidates in order to process accounts payable and receivable). We may also engage suppliers who provide IT technology services and solutions, which might include video interview and skills assessment tools;</p>
