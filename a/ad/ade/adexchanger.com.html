<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Information That You Give Us: </strong>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily choose to register for certain Services at this Site (such as receiving e-mail newsletters), respond to a survey, or contact us with comments or inquiries.</p>

We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Data</span>:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Passively Collected Information: </em></strong>When you interact with Jebbert through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Jebbert may store such information itself or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by Jebbert’ affiliates, agents or service providers. Jebbert may use such information and/or pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. <strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Cookies:</em></strong><strong> </strong>In operating this Site, we will use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your computer when you access a Web site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Do We Use Your Personal Data?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Jebbert, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Requirements: </strong> Jebbert may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Jebbert, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, sale of assets or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred company and/or assets.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Are Your Choices?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>As outlined in this Privacy Policy, you can always choose not to provide your Personal Data to the Site, however doing so may prevent you from obtaining certain information or using other valuable Services.<strong> </strong></p>
