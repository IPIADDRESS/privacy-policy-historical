                <h4><a class="noLink" name="nuisance">Nuisance posters</a></h4>
                <p>
                    Our first line of defense against nuisance posts is to delete them and to ban the user.
                    Nuisance posts include potentially defamatory and/or infringing material, surreptitious advertising,
                    spam, any other posts which breach the posting guidelines and any form of messages, posts or
                    emails deemed offensive by the administrators or moderators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where a nuisance poster persists, we reserve the right to use email addresses and IP addresses
                    to identify the user and halt the nuisance. For example, on a very few occasions, we have
                    reported to organisations that it appeared that one of their employees or other users of
                    their computer equipment was repeatedly making nuisance posts on the Site and asked them
                    to take steps to stop it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where a poster recommends the products or services of their employer, they should state
                    their conflict of interest. Where they do not do so, we reserve the right to point out
                    that the poster appears to have a conflict of interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In common with many sites we use Google Analytics for web-site statistics.
                    Some people have raised concerns about the privacy aspects of this service,
                    as Google have access to your IP address (but not your Adverts.ie username or email address).

                    whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing
                    location-based advertisements) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such
                    as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

                    (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you
                    and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your
                    previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas,
                    you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site
                    about hockey). DART uses "non personally identifiable information". It does NOT track personal
                    information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number,
                    social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this
