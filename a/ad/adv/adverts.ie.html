		            You should include any personal identifiers which you supplied earlier 
		            via the website (e.g. username &amp; e-mail address) if you do not supply 
		            this verification information, no information will be provided. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            This request only covers the private information contained in your private profile. 
		            Any information that is publically available in posts and threads on the forum will 
		            not be provided. Your request will be dealt with as soon as possible and will take 
		            not more than 40 days to process.

		        <h4><a class="noLink" name="nuisance">Nuisance posters</a></h4>
		
		        <p>
		            Our first line of defense against nuisance posts is to delete them and to ban the user. 
		            Nuisance posts include potentially defamatory material, surreptitious advertising, spam, 
		            any other posts which breach the posting guidelines and any form of messages, posts or 
		            emails deemed offensive by the administrators or moderators. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            Where a nuisance poster persists, we reserve the right to use email addresses and IP addresses 
		            to identify the user and halt the nuisance. For example, on a very few occasions, we have 
		            reported to organisations that it appeared that one of their employees or other users of 
		            their computer equipment was repeatedly making nuisance posts on Adverts.ie and asked them 
		            to take steps to stop it. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            Where a poster recommends the products or services of their employer, they should state 
		            their conflict of interest. Where they do not do so, we reserve the right to point out 
		            that the poster appears to have a conflict of interest. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            In common with many sites we use Google Analytics for web-site statistics. 
		            Some people have raised concerns about the privacy aspects of this service, 
		            as Google have access to your IP address (but not your Adverts.ie username or email address). 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            In addition to Google analytics Adverts.ie also stores full web logs for analysis purposes.

		            unauthorised access to it. The computers that store the information are kept in a secure 
		            facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other measures

		            We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you

		            update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing your details page.
