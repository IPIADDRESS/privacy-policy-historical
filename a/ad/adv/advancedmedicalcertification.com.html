<h3>Advanced Medical Certification LLC Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
  The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the
  way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With
  only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy
  goods and services, and communicate with others from around the
  world. It's important to Advanced Medical Certification LLC to help
  our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all
  the Internet has to offer.
</p>

<p>
  We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is
  important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you
  share with us. To protect your privacy, Advanced Medical
  Certification LLC follows different principles in accordance with
  worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.
</p>

<p>
  We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone
  number, email address or any other information to anyone.  We'll use
  state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from
  unauthorized users.
</p>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>
  We will ask you when we need information that personally
  identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact
  you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a
  Registration ID on the site or when you download free software,
  enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access
  premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary
  purposes:
</p><ul>
  <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
  <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
  <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
  <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information
    and other new services from Advanced Medical Certification LLC.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Consent</h3>

<p>
  If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you
  can still use most of /. But you will not be able to
  access areas that require registration.
</p>

<p>
  If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of
  information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various
  services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us
  to communicate with you about other offers regarding Advanced
  Medical Certification LLC products, programs, events, or services
  by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option
  stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC.
</p>

<p>
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC occasionally allows other
  companies to offer our registered customers information about
  their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not
  want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating
  that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third
  parties.
</p>

<h3>Access</h3>

<p>
  We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal
  information is correct and current. You may review and update this
  information at any time at the Visitor Center. There, you can:
</p><ul>
  <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
  <li>Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information,
    or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.</li>
  <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>
  <li>Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again.
    Wherever you go on /, your information stays with you.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC has taken strong measures to
  protect the security of your personal information and to ensure
  that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong
  precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
  access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
</p>

<p>
  We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and
  secure. When you place orders or access your personal account
  information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which
  encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the
  Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
  available.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair
  Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you
  liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If
  your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover
  your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your
  credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from
  purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of
  unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit
  card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and
  procedures.
</p>

<p>
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC strictly protects the security
  of your personal information and honors your choices for its
  intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse,
  unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
</p>

<p>
  Your personal information is never shared outside the company
  without your permission, except under conditions explained
  above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled
  servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and
  processed in United States of America or any other country where
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates
  or agents are located.
</p>

<p>
  You also have a significant role in protecting your
  information. No one can see or edit your personal information
  without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these
  with others.
</p>

<h3>Notice to Parents</h3>

<p>
  Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's
  privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and
  responsible use of their Personal Information while using the
  Internet.
</p>

<p>
  The Advanced Medical Certification LLC site does not publish
  content that is targeted to children. However, if you are
  concerned about your children providing Advanced Medical
  Certification LLC any personal information without your consent,
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC offers a Kids account. It
  allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use
  and sharing of children's (ages 12 and under) personal information
  online.
</p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>
  If for some reason you believe Advanced Medical Certification LLC
  has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at
  support@advmedcert.com, and we will do our best to determine and
  correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy
  are in the Subject line.
</p>


<h3>Electronic Product Registration</h3>

<p>
  When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register
  your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your
  registration information with any information you've already left
  with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you
  haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal
  profile for you from your product registration information. If you
  ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the
  Profile Center, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the
  Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already
  created a Registration ID, we will ask you to do so. This ensures
  that only you can access your information.
</p>

<h3>Customer Profiles</h3>

<p>
  As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique
  personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal
  identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can
  access your profile.
</p>

<p>
  When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal
  identification number, and then send this personal identification
  number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a
  very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your
  passport to seamless travel across /, allowing you to
  download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium
  sites without having to fill out registration forms with
  information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers,
  you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to
  identify yourself.
</p>

<h3>What we do with the information you share</h3>

<p>
  When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,
  including your name and email address. We use this information
  to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure
  your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and
  exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask
  for your credit card number and billing address. We use this
  information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that
  time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case
  you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information
  again without your permission.
</p>

<p>
  We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services
  on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering
  purchases, answering customer questions about products or
  services, sending postal mail and processing event
  registration. We will only provide those companies the information
  they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
  using that information for any other purpose.
</p>

<p>
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC will disclose your personal
  information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or
  in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a)
  conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process
  served on Advanced Medical Certification LLC or the site; (b)
  protect and defend the rights or property of Advanced Medical
  Certification LLC and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in
  urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of
  Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its Websites, or the
  public.
