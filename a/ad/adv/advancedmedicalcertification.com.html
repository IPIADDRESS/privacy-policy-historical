    <h3>Advanced Medical Certification LLC Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>
      The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the
      way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With
      only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy
      goods and services, and communicate with others from around the
      world. It's important to Advanced Medical Certification LLC to help
      our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all
      the Internet has to offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is
      important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you
      share with us. To protect your privacy, Advanced Medical
      Certification LLC follows different principles in accordance with
      worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone
      number, email address or any other information to anyone.  We'll use
      state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from
      unauthorized users.
    </p>

    <h4>Notice</h4>

    <p>
      We will ask you when we need information that personally
      identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact
      you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a
      Registration ID on the site or when you download free software,
      enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access
      premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary
      purposes:
      </p><ul>
        <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
        <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
        <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
        <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information
          and other new services from Advanced Medical Certification LLC.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Consent</h4>

    <p>
      If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you
      can still use most of /. But you will not be able to
      access areas that require registration.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of
      information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various
      services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us
      to communicate with you about other offers regarding Advanced
      Medical Certification LLC products, programs, events, or services
      by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option
      stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC occasionally allows other
      companies to offer our registered customers information about
      their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not
      want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating
      that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third
      parties.
    </p>

    <h4>Access</h4>

    <p>
      We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal
      information is correct and current. You may review and update this
      information at any time at the Visitor Center. There, you can:
    </p><ul>
      <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
      <li>Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information,
        or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.</li>
      <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>
      <li>Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again.
        Wherever you go on /, your information stays with you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Security</h4>

    <p>
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC has taken strong measures to
      protect the security of your personal information and to ensure
      that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong
      precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
      access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and
      secure. When you place orders or access your personal account
      information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which
      encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the
      Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
      available.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair
      Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you
      liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If
      your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover
      your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your
      credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from
      purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of
      unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit
      card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and
      procedures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC strictly protects the security
      of your personal information and honors your choices for its
      intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse,
      unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your personal information is never shared outside the company
      without your permission, except under conditions explained
      above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled
      servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and
      processed in United States of America or any other country where
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates
      or agents are located.
    </p>

    <p>
      You also have a significant role in protecting your
      information. No one can see or edit your personal information
      without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these
      with others.
    </p>

    <h4>Notice to Parents</h4>

    <p>
      Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's
      privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and
      responsible use of their Personal Information while using the
      Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Advanced Medical Certification LLC site does not publish
      content that is targeted to children. However, if you are
      concerned about your children providing Advanced Medical
      Certification LLC any personal information without your consent,
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC offers a Kids account. It
      allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use
      and sharing of children's (ages 12 and under) personal information
      online.
    </p>

    <h4>Enforcement</h4>

    <p>
      If for some reason you believe Advanced Medical Certification LLC
      has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at
      support@advmedcert.com, and we will do our best to determine and
      correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy
      are in the Subject line.
    </p>


    <h4>Electronic Product Registration</h4>

    <p>
      When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register
      your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your
      registration information with any information you've already left
      with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you
      haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal
      profile for you from your product registration information. If you
      ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the
      Profile Center, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the
      Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already
      created a Registration ID, we will ask you to do so. This ensures
      that only you can access your information.
    </p>

    <h4>Customer Profiles</h4>

    <p>
      As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique
      personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal
      identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can
      access your profile.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal
      identification number, and then send this personal identification
      number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a
      very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your
      passport to seamless travel across /, allowing you to
      download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium
      sites without having to fill out registration forms with
      information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers,
      you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to
      identify yourself.
    </p>

    <h4>What we do with the information you share</h4>

    <p>
      When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,
      including your name and email address. We use this information
      to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure
      your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and
      exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask
      for your credit card number and billing address. We use this
      information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that
      time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case
      you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information
      again without your permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services
      on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering
      purchases, answering customer questions about products or
      services, sending postal mail and processing event
      registration. We will only provide those companies the information
      they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
      using that information for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC will disclose your personal
      information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or
      in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a)
      conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process
      served on Advanced Medical Certification LLC or the site; (b)
      protect and defend the rights or property of Advanced Medical
      Certification LLC and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in
      urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of
      Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its Websites, or the
      public.
