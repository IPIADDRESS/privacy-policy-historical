<!-- %p -->
<!-- The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the -->
<!-- way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With -->
<!-- only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy -->
<!-- goods and services, and communicate with others from around the -->
<!-- world. It's important to Advanced Medical Certification LLC to help -->
<!-- our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all -->
<!-- the Internet has to offer. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is -->
<!-- important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you -->
<!-- share with us. To protect your privacy, Advanced Medical -->
<!-- Certification LLC follows different principles in accordance with -->
<!-- worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone -->
<!-- number, email address or any other information to anyone.  We'll use -->
<!-- state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from -->
<!-- unauthorized users. -->
<!-- %h4 Notice -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We will ask you when we need information that personally -->
<!-- identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact -->
<!-- you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a -->
<!-- Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, -->
<!-- enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access -->
<!-- premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary -->
<!-- purposes: -->
<!-- %ul -->
<!-- %li To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once. -->
<!-- %li To help you quickly find software, services or information. -->
<!-- %li To help us create content most relevant to you. -->
<!-- %li -->
<!-- To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information -->
<!-- and other new services from Advanced Medical Certification LLC. -->
<!-- %h4 Consent -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you may not be able to access areas that require registration. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of -->
<!-- information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various -->
<!-- services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us -->
<!-- to communicate with you about other offers regarding Advanced -->
<!-- Medical Certification LLC products, programs, events, or services -->
<!-- by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option -->
<!-- stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC occasionally allows other -->
<!-- companies to offer our registered customers information about -->
<!-- their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not -->
<!-- want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating -->
<!-- that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third -->
<!-- parties. -->
<!-- %h4 Access -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal -->
<!-- information is correct and current. You may review and update this -->
<!-- information at any time at the Visitor Center. There, you can: -->
<!-- %ul -->
<!-- %li View and edit personal information you have already given us. -->
<!-- %li -->
<!-- Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information, -->
<!-- or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail. -->
<!-- %li Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products. -->
<!-- %li -->
<!-- Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. -->
<!-- Wherever you go on, your information stays with you. -->
<!-- %h4 Security -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC has taken strong measures to -->
<!-- protect the security of your personal information and to ensure -->
<!-- that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong -->
<!-- precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized -->
<!-- access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and -->
<!-- secure. When you place orders or access your personal account -->
<!-- information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which -->
<!-- encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the -->
<!-- Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies -->
<!-- available. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair -->
<!-- Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you -->
<!-- liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If -->
<!-- your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover -->
<!-- your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your -->
<!-- credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from -->
<!-- purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of -->
<!-- unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit -->
<!-- card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and -->
<!-- procedures. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC strictly protects the security -->
<!-- of your personal information and honors your choices for its -->
<!-- intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, -->
<!-- unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- Your personal information is never shared outside the company -->
<!-- without your permission, except under conditions explained -->
<!-- above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled -->
<!-- servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and -->
<!-- processed in United States of America or any other country where -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates -->
<!-- or agents are located. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- You also have a significant role in protecting your -->
<!-- information. No one can see or edit your personal information -->
<!-- without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these -->
<!-- with others. -->
<!-- %h4 Notice to Parents -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's -->
<!-- privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and -->
<!-- responsible use of their Personal Information while using the -->
<!-- Internet. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- The Advanced Medical Certification LLC site does not publish -->
<!-- content that is targeted to children. However, if you are -->
<!-- concerned about your children providing Advanced Medical -->
<!-- Certification LLC any personal information without your consent, -->
<!-- Advanced Medical Certification LLC offers a Kids account. It -->
<!-- allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use -->
<!-- and sharing of children's (ages 12 and under) personal information -->
<!-- online. -->
<!-- %h4 Enforcement -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- If for some reason you believe Advanced Medical Certification LLC -->
<!-- has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at -->
<!-- support@advmedcert.com, and we will do our best to determine and -->
<!-- correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy -->
<!-- are in the Subject line. -->
<!-- %h4 Electronic Product Registration -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register -->
<!-- your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your -->
<!-- registration information with any information you've already left -->
<!-- with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you -->
<!-- haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal -->
<!-- profile for you from your product registration information. If you -->
<!-- ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the -->
<!-- Profile Center, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the -->
<!-- Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already -->
<!-- created a Registration ID, we will ask you to do so. This ensures -->
<!-- that only you can access your information. -->
<!-- %h4 Customer Profiles -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique -->
<!-- personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal -->
<!-- identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can -->
<!-- access your profile. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal -->
<!-- identification number, and then send this personal identification -->
<!-- number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a -->
<!-- very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your -->
<!-- passport to seamless travel across /, allowing you to -->
<!-- download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium -->
<!-- sites without having to fill out registration forms with -->
<!-- information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, -->
<!-- you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to -->
<!-- identify yourself. -->
<!-- %h4 What we do with the information you share -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, -->
<!-- including your name and email address. We use this information -->
<!-- to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure -->
<!-- your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and -->
<!-- exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask -->
<!-- for your credit card number and billing address. We use this -->
<!-- information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that -->
<!-- time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case -->
<!-- you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information -->
<!-- again without your permission. -->
<!-- %p -->
<!-- We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services -->
<!-- on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering -->
<!-- purchases, answering customer questions about products or -->
<!-- services, sending postal mail and processing event -->
<!-- registration. We will only provide those companies the information -->
<!-- they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from -->
<!-- using that information for any other purpose. -->

        Advanced Medical Certification LLC Privacy Policy
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the
        way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With
        only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy
        goods and services, and communicate with others from around the
        world. It's important to Advanced Medical Certification LLC to help
        our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all
        the Internet has to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is
        important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you
        share with us. To protect your privacy, Advanced Medical
        Certification LLC follows different principles in accordance with
        worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We won't sell or give away your name, mail address, phone
        number, email address or any other information to anyone.  We'll use
        state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from
        unauthorized users.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Notice
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will ask you when we need information that personally
        identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact
        you. Generally, this information is requested when you create a
        Registration ID on the site or when you download free software,
        enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access
        premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary
        purposes:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
          </li>
          <li>
            To help you quickly find software, services or information.
          </li>
          <li>
            To help us create content most relevant to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information
            and other new services from Advanced Medical Certification LLC.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h4>
        Consent
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you may not be able to access areas that require registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of
        information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various
        services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us
        to communicate with you about other offers regarding Advanced
        Medical Certification LLC products, programs, events, or services
        by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option
        stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC occasionally allows other
        companies to offer our registered customers information about
        their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not
        want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating
        that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third
        parties.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Access
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal
        information is correct and current. You may review and update this
        information at any time at the Visitor Center. There, you can:
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            View and edit personal information you have already given us.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information,
            or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.
          </li>
          <li>
            Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again.
            Wherever you go on, your information stays with you.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h4>
        Security
      </h4>
      <p>
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC has taken strong measures to
        protect the security of your personal information and to ensure
        that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong
        precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized
        access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and
        secure. When you place orders or access your personal account
        information, you're utilizing secure server software SSL, which
        encrypts your personal information before it's sent over the
        Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair
        Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you
        liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If
        your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we'll cover
        your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your
        credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from
        purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of
        unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit
        card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and
        procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC strictly protects the security
        of your personal information and honors your choices for its
        intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse,
        unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal information is never shared outside the company
        without your permission, except under conditions explained
        above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled
        servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and
        processed in United States of America or any other country where
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates
        or agents are located.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have a significant role in protecting your
        information. No one can see or edit your personal information
        without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these
        with others.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Notice to Parents
      </h4>
      <p>
        Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children's
        privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and
        responsible use of their Personal Information while using the
        Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Advanced Medical Certification LLC site does not publish
        content that is targeted to children. However, if you are
        concerned about your children providing Advanced Medical
        Certification LLC any personal information without your consent,
        Advanced Medical Certification LLC offers a Kids account. It
        allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use
        and sharing of children's (ages 12 and under) personal information
        online.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Enforcement
      </h4>
      <p>
        If for some reason you believe Advanced Medical Certification LLC
        has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at
        support@advmedcert.com, and we will do our best to determine and
        correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy
        are in the Subject line.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Electronic Product Registration
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register
        your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your
        registration information with any information you've already left
        with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you
        haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal
        profile for you from your product registration information. If you
        ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the
        Profile Center, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the
        Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already
        created a Registration ID, we will ask you to do so. This ensures
        that only you can access your information.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Customer Profiles
      </h4>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique
        personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal
        identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can
        access your profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal
        identification number, and then send this personal identification
        number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a
        very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your
        passport to seamless travel across /, allowing you to
        download free software, order free newsletters, and visit premium
        sites without having to fill out registration forms with
        information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers,
        you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to
        identify yourself.
      </p>
      <h4>
        What we do with the information you share
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,
        including your name and email address. We use this information
        to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure
        your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and
        exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, we ask
        for your credit card number and billing address. We use this
        information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that
        time. For your convenience, we do save billing information in case
        you want to order from us again, but we don't use this information
        again without your permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services
        on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering
        purchases, answering customer questions about products or
        services, sending postal mail and processing event
        registration. We will only provide those companies the information
        they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from
        using that information for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
