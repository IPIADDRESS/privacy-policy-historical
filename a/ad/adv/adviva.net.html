	<h1>Adviva Network : Adserving Privacy Policy </h1>
			<h2>Overview </h2>
		<p>Adviva consider the issues around  user privacy on the internet very carefully and the following is intended to be a plain english explanation of the guidelines we currently employ. We always welcome comments on our policy and constantly strive to maintain a policy which improves the service we provide to advertisers, publishers and web users in general. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>What we do </h2>
		<p>Adviva is an Online Advertising Network. We work with hundreds of websites in the UK, France and Germany taking display (image) advertising space and selling it in carefully targeted packages to advertisers and agencies. The targeting options we offer range from site content level, where an advertiser may choose to display on a specific category of sites, eg sports sites, to more complicated targeting involving keywords or user behaviour. As we target, we aim to indentify the sites and users that are most likely to create a response to an advertisers campaign.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Tracking </h2>
		<p>To gain a greater understanding of a sites performance, or a user's likely interests, we use a variety of tracking technologies as follows : </p>
		<p><strong>Performance Tracking</strong><br>We monitor the sales, signups or visits to certain pages on our advertisers' websites. We connect these page 'hits' back to the websites on our network which the user visited previously and/or where the user clicked on an advert. Using this information, we can calculate which websites and/or which profile of user is likely to best respond to a particular campaign.  </p>
		<p><strong>Ad Display Counting </strong><br>
		We  use cookies to make sure users see particular adverts a limited number of times. This limit is agreed by the advertiser, Adviva and the publisher and this prevents users repeatedly seeing the same advert.  </p>
		<p><strong>Behavioural Profiling</strong><br>To create a behavioural profile, we log which websites' users have seen our adverts. This is important - we don't monitor your internet usage on any website or any other activity other than when you visit a website where we display an ad to you. Depending on the content of the sites you visit, we build an anonymous profile which contains information on your potential interests and an estimated demographic. For example, if you visit a sports site within our network then we may classify you as interested in sport. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>How do we use this data </h2>
		<p>Adviva use the information we collect to target advertising campaigns more effectively. The aim is for you to see adverts which you are more likely to be interested in rather than ads that you aren't. We do this by comparing the information relating to your anonymous profile against our selection of advert campaigns and choosing the most suitable advert. </p>
		<p>It's important to understand that Adviva can only create these profiles and display ads to you when you visit an ad-funded website which we work with. In the majority of cases, the website you view will not charge you, but is being funded by the ads that you view. The more effective the advertising on a site, the more money it can generate. It's important to understand that website advertising ultimately means that the websites you visit can afford to exist. </p>
		<p>Adviva feel that by creating only anonymous profiles we can offer increased performance to our advertisers and enhanced revenues for our websites, without crossing the line and 'spying' on you. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Personally Identifiable Information/Anonymous profiles </h2>
		<p>The IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau), which is a trade association for the internet marketing industry, define personally indentifiable information as 'information that can be traced back to a specific user and provide personal information such as name, address, phone number, etc'. In other words, it's information about you that can indentify you as a person rather than an anonymous profile. </p>
		<p>All our profiles are anonymous. For us, they are nothing more than a number with which we associate interests and/or an estimated demographic profile. Adviva never attempt to establish any link between the anonymous user profiles we create and personally indentifiable information. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		 
		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored within a folder on your computer and are used only by your internet browser. They take up a tiny amount of space on your computer (less than a regular webpage without images does) and can be used to uniquely, but anonymously, indentify your computer. </p>
		<p>Most websites use cookies to identify users and improve the user experience. The cookies Adviva use are technically the same. The Adviva cookie does not harm your computer in any way or provide us with any information about your identity. </p><p>A couple of so called spyware software packages classify the Adviva cookie as spyware or adware. This is not the case. The general definition of spyware/adware is that of a software package installed on your computer for purposes of monitoring all your internet or general computer activity. We do not now and never have used such methods and the classification is incorrect. We do not install software of any kind on your computer and have no ability to monitor or track your general computer or internet usage.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Opting Out of Profiling </h2>
		<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this document, we take issues surrounding internet privacy seriously. By only using anonymous data, we aim to provide better revenues to websites through better campaign performance without ever spying on internet users. </p>
		<p>If, however, you feel that you would like to opt out of Adviva's anonymous profiling, then you can do this simply by clicking on the link below. Please note that to identify you as having opted out of our profiling system, we need to set a cookie on your machine telling us that. You should not delete this Adviva cookie from your computer. The only information stored on this cookie will be a simple code telling us not to profile you. If you are using spyware detection software, the software may incorrectly classify our cookies as spyware. Again, you need to be careful not to delete the cookie or we may start profiling you again. </p>
