<b>Our Approach to Small Business Privacy Practices</b><br>
At Advanta, we recognize that our business customers and other business visitors are concerned about privacy. We want you to be confident that we make every effort to safeguard the security and confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information. In addition to the account-related information our customers share with us, we may invite you to submit your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information in order to participate in promotions or receive newsletters or other publications geared to businesses and business professionals which are featured from time to time on our Web site or presented by other means. We may also collect personally identifiable response-related information from our interactions with you, including e-mail interactions. For example, we use pixels on certain of our Web pages and may place a cookie on your computer so that we can identify you as a visitor to our site, which enables us, in conjunction with our advertising service providers, to present content concerning products and services that may be of interest to you. In order for us to maintain high levels of service, personally identifiable information that we collect may be shared with our affiliated companies and service providers in accordance with applicable law. In some cases we may also bring offers to your attention ourselves or in cooperation with reputable third parties. Finally, we may transfer information collected from you in connection with a sale of our business.<br><br>

We make a concerted effort to restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and service providers who need to know that information to provide products or services to you, and to maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. <br><br>We use pixels on certain of our Web pages, and accessing our Web site may result in the placement of a "cookie" on your computer. This is done to enable you to use our Web site as well as to make your repeated experience more convenient and so that we and our advertising service providers can present content that may be of interest to you and know how you came to visit our site. Please be aware that if you modify the setting of your Internet browser to prevent the use of cookies or if you otherwise disable our cookie, you will not be able to access the Web site. We may also place "flash objects" on your computer in order to collect browser and other information that helps us improve the security of your online communications with our Web site. Also, when using our site please be aware of the "Web Site Terms and Conditions" page, as your access to the site is subject to the terms described there. <br><br>

Our Web site contains links to other sites that you may find useful. Please be aware that Advanta is not responsible for the privacy practices relating to information collected by others' sites. <br><br>

<b>Opting Out of E-mail Offers</b><br>
Advanta sends account-related and third-party e-mail offers to keep its customers and other visitors informed of special opportunities, online account enhancements and offers that they may want to take advantage of. These offers always come directly from Advanta or its service providers, and we never share your e-mail address with third-party marketers except with your authorization or in accordance with applicable law. And while the majority of our customers appreciate receiving these communications Advanta's e-mail offers include the option to opt out of receiving future e-mail marketing solicitations. In addition, you can set your e-mail preferences online in the Customer Preference Center section of Advanta.com. <br><br>

You also have the option to decline receipt of direct mail and telemarketing offers from Advanta. Please call our Customer Service Department at 1-800-705-7255 to inform us of your opt out choices. <br><br>

If you are an Advanta customer, we reserve the right to communicate with you via e-mail, direct mail or telephone to protect your account from unauthorized access or identity theft; to process your requests for such things as balance transfers, employee cards or credit line increases; if any collection efforts are indicated; and generally to service your account. In addition, any e-mail opt-out shall not apply to e-mails permitted by applicable law, such as messages relating to any transaction you have requested or your relationship with us.<br><br>
