This policy covers ADVFN's use of personal information that ADVFN collects 
when you use ADVFN.com. The policy also gives you information about cookies; ADVFN 
and third parties' use of cookies; and how you may reject such cookies.
</p><p>
From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about 
yourself (e.g. name and email address) in order to receive or use services on 
our website. Such services include newsletters, competitions, live chats, 
message boards and ADVFN.com membership.
</p><p>
By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable ADVFN and its 
service providers to provide you with the services you select. Whenever you 
provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance 
with this policy. When using your personal information ADVFN will act in 
accordance with current legislation and aim to meet current Internet best 
practice.
</p><p>
Visitor Information During the course of any visit to ADVFN.com, the pages 
you see, along with a short text file called a 'cookie', are downloaded to your 
computer. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do 
useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has 
visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, 
and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.
</p><p>
Information supplied by cookies can help us to provide you with a better online 
user experience and assist us to analyse the profile of our visitors. For 
example: if on a previous visit you went to our education pages, we might find 
this out from your cookie and highlight educational information on your second 
and subsequent visits.
</p><p>
What is a cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an 
anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's 
computer and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own 
cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect 
your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has 
already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
</p><p>
Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online 
traffic flows.
</p><p>
Cookies record information about your online preferences. Users have the 
opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a 
cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of 
course, means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that 
user user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of 
ADVFN.com features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of 
your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
</p><p>
If you have set your computer to reject cookies you can still browse ADVFN.com 
anonymously until such time as you wish to register for ADVFN.com services. For 
further information on cookies please visit www.aboutcookies.org.
</p><p>
Use and storage of your personal information When you supply any personal 
information to ADVFN.com (e.g. for competitions, ADVFN.com Community services or 
ADVFN.com membership) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we use 
those data. We must collect the information fairly, that is, we must explain how 
we will use it (see the notices on particular webpages that let you know why we 
are requesting the information) and tell you if we want to pass the information 
on to anyone else.
</p><p>
In general, any information you provide to ADVFN will only be used within the 
ADVFN and by its agents and service providers. Your information will be disclosed 
where we are obliged or permitted by law. Also, if you post or send offensive, 
inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to ADVFN.com or otherwise 
engage in any disruptive behaviour on ADVFN.com, ADVFN can use whatever 
information that is available to it about you to stop such behaviour. This may 
involve informing relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-
mail/Internet provider and law enforcement agencies about the content and your 
behaviour.
</p><p>
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the 
service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been 
met, or, in the case of ADVFN.com membership you no longer wish to continue your 
registration as a ADVFN.com member. For safety reasons, however, ADVFN may 
store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times 
and dates) arising from the use of ADVFN.com Community services such as 
Connector for a period of six months. Where personal information is held for 
people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other ADVFN.com 
services (e.g. competitions), that information will be held as long as is 
necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all 
personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data 
Protection Act 1998.
</p><p>
If you are notified on a ADVFN.com site that your information may be used to 
allow ADVFN to contact you for "service administration purposes", this means 
that ADVFN may contact you for a number of purposes related to the service you 
have signed up for. For example, we may wish to provide you with password 
reminders or notify you that the particular service has been suspended for 
maintenance. We will contact you for promotional purposes, such as notifying 
you of improvements to the service or new services on ADVFN.com. You can alter your
email settings by going to http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=subscriptions
</p><p>
Access to your personal information You have the right to request a copy of 
the personal information ADVFN holds about you and to have any inaccuracies 
corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests.) Please address requests to 
the Data Protection Officer, ADVFN.com, 26 Throgmorton Street, London, EC2N 2AN.
</p><p>
Users 16 and under If you are aged 16 or under, please get your 
parent/guardian's permission beforehand whenever you provide personal 
information to ADVFN's website. Users without this consent are not allowed to 
provide us with personal information.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>
