        <strong>Introduction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        At Advantage Rent A Car (“Advantage”), we are committed to protecting your 
        privacy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you 
        or that you may provide when you visit the website “advantage.com” (our 
        “Website”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and 
        disclosing that information. If you do not agree with any of the terms of this 
        privacy policy, please do not use this Website.</p>
    <p class="style1">
        This policy applies to information we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>on this Website. </li>
        <li>in e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and this Website.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="style1">
        It may not apply to information collected by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information gathered at the rental location, via the claims process (accident 
        related), via the roadside assistance (breakdown related), customer service 
        process, call center interaction (recorded calls). </li>
        <li>through any other means, including on any other website operated by Advantage 
        or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Advantage recognizes the privacy protections afforded to individuals in the 
        European Union (“E.U.”) and Switzerland with regard to personal data (as defined 
        below) in connection with the transfer and protection of “personal data” 
        received from the E.U. Advantage has subscribed to and complies with the 
        voluntary U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor program and the voluntary U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 
        program (the “Safe Harbor Frameworks”), in accordance with the E.U. Directive 
        95/46/EC established by the European Commission and the Swiss Federal Act on 
        Data Protection (collectively, the “Data Protection Directives”) by adopting and 
        implementing the privacy principles set forth in this Privacy Policy (the 
        “Principles”).</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable 
        natural person (or legal person, in the case of the Swiss Safe Harbor Framework) 
        (a “data subject”), where an identifiable person is one who can be identified, 
        directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number 
        or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, 
        economic, cultural or social identity. Data that is publicly available in some 
        countries is subject to regulation in others. For purposes of this Privacy 
        Policy, personal data does not include information that has been anonymized, 
        encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is 
        publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal data.</p>
    <p>
        The following Principles serve to provide notice that Advantage will ask you to 
        provide personal data if you create an account or use the Website. Please read 
        this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your 
        information, including your personal data, and how we will treat it. By 
        accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This privacy 
        policy may change from time to time, as explained further below.

        <strong>Choices about How We Use and Disclose Your Information for E.U. and Switzerland 
        Residents</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following Principles serve to provide notice to E.U. and Switzerland 
        residents that Advantage transfer personal data you provide outside of the E.U. 
        or Switzerland, as applicable, to Advantage. Advantage is a member of the 
        U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.
        Advantage complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor 
        Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the 
        collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union 
        member countries and Switzerland. Advantage has certified that it adheres to the 
        Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, 
        data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor 
        program, and to view our certification page, please visit 
        http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</p>
    <p>
        Advantage will not use personal data for purposes other than those for which it 
        was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the E.U. or Swiss 
        individual unless the individual affirmatively and explicitly consents 
        (“opts-in”) to the processing, or unless an exception applies. Should the 
        information collected be “sensitive” personal data, Advantage will not disclose 
        such information to a third party or use it for any purpose other than for which 
        it was originally collected unless you opt-in to Advantage doing so. Advantage 
        also provides E.U. and Swiss individuals with the opportunity to withdraw 
        consent at any time (“opt-out”) of their information being used for a purpose 
        other than for which it was originally collected or when such information is to 
        be disclosed for the first time to a third party, in which case their personal 
        data will not be further processed. If at any time after providing personal data 
        to Advantage, you decide to opt-out of Advantage’s use of your personal data, 
        you may contact Customer Service or e-mail us at
        <a href="mailto:PersonalData@Advantage.com">PersonalData@Advantage.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Access and Correction:</b> Upon written request to Advantage, Advantage will provide 
        individuals in the E.U. and Switzerland with reasonable access to their personal 
        data. Advantage will also take reasonable steps to allow E.U. and Swiss 
        individuals to review their information for the purposes of correction their 
        information. There are certain limitations to the Access and Correction rights, 
        as set forth in the US Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor website. 
        (http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)</p>
    <p>
        Advantage employs reasonable methods to ensure that any personal data held about 
        E.U. and Swiss individuals is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable 
        in relation to the purposes for which the information was obtained. Advantage 
        collects personal data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the 
        purposes for which it is to be processed. E.U. and Swiss individuals have a 
        responsibility to assist Advantage in maintaining accurate, complete and current 
        personal data about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you believe that any personal data provided to Advantage is incorrect, or is, 
        has been, or might be used inappropriately, please contact us at 
        PersonalData@Advantage.com, and we will take steps to correct the information as 
        appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Onward Transfer:</b> If Advantage transfers personal data to a third party that is 
        acting as an agent, Advantage will do so only if Advantage verifies that the 
        third party (a) subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles and has certified its 
        compliance, and is accordingly independently responsible for complying with the 
        Safe Harbor requirements; (b) is subject to the Data Protection Directives or 
        another adequacy finding; or (c) Advantage has entered into a written agreement 
        with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same 
        level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adherence by Advantage to these Principles may be limited (i) to the extent 
        required to respond to a legal or ethical obligation; (ii) to the extent 
        necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement 
        obligations; and (iii) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, 
        rule or regulation.
