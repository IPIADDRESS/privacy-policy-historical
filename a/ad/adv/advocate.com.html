			<br>
			Third-party partners, Advocate.com advertisers, and other Web sites you may access via Advocate.com have different privacy policies and are not subject to this privacy policy. We recommend that you read the privacy statement of each such Web site to find out how your personal information is protected.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Collection and Use of User Details<br>

			<b>Managing Your Print Subscription<br>
			</b><br>
			We collect your name, postal address, and e-mail address to service and deliver your print magazine subscription. Credit card information is collected only when you choose to make an online payment for your subscription order. Our site is secure for credit card transactions. <br>
			 <br>
			The e-mail address you provide for your print subscription will be used only to contact you about your account with us. We will send confirmation e-mails whenever you place an order, change your address, or otherwise manage your subscription account online. We may also e-mail you when it is time to renew your current subscription or with other special offers directly related to your subscription. Your e-mail address will never be rented or sold to any third party.   <br>
			<br>
			On occasion, your postal address may be used to market to you carefully screened direct-mail offers about products or services from other organizations that we think may be of interest of you.  If you prefer not to receive such offers at your postal address, please click here (<a href="http://www.lpimagazines.com/theadvocate/cs.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.lpimagazines.com/theadvocate/cs.aspx</a>) to e-mail your request to our customer service department. <br>
			 <br>
			We also collect information you can submit about other people if you order a gift. In such cases, we will use the recipient's name and address to service and deliver his or her print magazine subscription. <br>
			<br>
			It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't experience problems with the delivery of products.<br>
