				Welcome to the Advertising Week websites (<a href="http://www.advertisingweek.com">www.advertisingweek.com</a>, <a href="http://www.advertisingweek.eu">www.advertisingweek.eu</a>, <a href="http://www.advertisingweek.asia">www.advertisingweek.asia</a>) (collectively, the “Website”) operated by or for Advertising Week, located at 131 West 33rd&nbsp;Street, Suite 800, New York, NY 10001 (“AW”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how your personal data and personally identifiable information (“PD/PII”) and other information is collected by us in operating the Website.

"App" means any third-party app downloadable through Google play or the App Store or any other venue (including any updates/upgrades to that app). When the word “Website” is used herein, it encompasses the App.<br>
				<br>
				This App facilitates the transmission of a list of installed apps on your device to a third party's server. This information may be used to provide you with advertisements, promotions or information that are better suited to your interests. If you do not agree to the transmission of a list of your installed Apps to a third party, please do not install this App.<br>
				<br>
				To assist you in reading our Privacy Policy, we have provided answers to the following frequently asked questions:<br>
				<br>
				* Who is the official Data Controller?<br>
				* How does the Website work?<br>
				* What type of PD/PII does AW collect from you and how do we use it?<br>
				* Under what circumstances may we share your PD/PII?<br>
				* What is the right of access, correction, deletion and opposition?<br>
				* Opting Out<br>
				* What other information does AW collect?<br>

				* California Privacy Rights<br>
				* Do we have a mechanism to address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Who is the official Data Controller?</b><br>
				The Official Data Controller is Advertising Week, who will ensure that the PD/PII is processed pursuant to applicable laws, including without limitation (i) &nbsp;the European Data Protection Legislation, namely the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive, applicable to Advertising Week as the official Data Controller of the PD/PII, (ii) the Federal Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992 (Switzerland), as applicable, and (ii)&nbsp; Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>How does the Website work?</b><br>
				The Website offers visitors to the Website (“you” or “your”) the opportunity to browse the Website and use certain features on the Website. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your information by AW as described herein. AW reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement. Such changes will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What type of PD/PII does AW collect from you and how do we use it?</b><br>
				AW does not require you to provide us with any PD/PII. Unless you provide your PD/PII to AW through the Website, we will not collect any PD/PII from you. However, in order to use certain functionality (including, for example, to subscribe to our newsletters) on the Website, to participate in promotions offered from time to time or to purchase products through the Website, you will need to provide certain PD/PII to us. PD/PII may include your name, your personal address, the identity of your employer, your business address, your email addresses, your gender, your age, your location, your phone number, your financial information (credit or debit card).<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Under what circumstances may we share your PD/PII?</b><br>
				By clicking “I consent” upon registration, you have agreed that AW may share your PD/PII with other entities who work on our behalf or with us. These entities may use your PD/PII to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered as part of the Website. Also, our parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or operations may be transferred, will be able to use your PD/PII.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				By clicking “I consent” upon registration, you have agreed that on occasion, AW may share your PD/PII with third parties for special features and marketing purposes. For example, our AWConnect™ program allows you to connect with other registered attendees via direct message and LinkedIn. Other means of connection may be added at our sole discretion. We may add a geolocation feature, provided by a third party partner with whom your PD/PII may be shared, to allow you to find your colleagues, making it easy to meet up. Another third party partner may send notifications and messages to you automatically, following your Account preferences. &nbsp;<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>What is the right of access, correction, deletion and opposition?</b><br>
				You have the right to access, correct or delete PD/PII about you as well as the opportunity to object to the processing of the PD/PII by AW, which you may exercise at any time by submitting a request to us at:<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				Advertising Week, 131 West 33rd Street, New York, NY 10001, Attn: Legal or by using the following link at <a href="mailto:optout@advertisingweek.com">optout@advertisingweek.com</a>.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Opting Out</b><br>
				You may opt-out of AWConnect™ or some AWConnect™ features by logging into your online Advertising Week user account and updating your preferences or by uninstalling the App. If you would rather us not share your PD/PII with any third party for AWConnect™ or other marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PD/PII to AW through the Website or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PD/PII with third parties for marketing purposes by submitting such a request in writing (an “Opt-Out Request”) to us at:<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				Advertising Week, 131 West 33rd&nbsp;Street, New York, NY 10001,Attn: Legal or by using the following link at <a href="mailto:optout@advertisingweek.com">optout@advertisingweek.com</a>.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				Please note that it may take time for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request and, in the interim, we may continue to use your PD/PII as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PD/PII to help us ensure we can honor such requests to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing. If we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PD/PII with a third party, AW may not be able to control use of such PD/PII by such third party (or any other party to whom such third party may have transferred your PD/PII). In such an event you agree that AW shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused in connection with the use of such PD/PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about AW sharing your PD/PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PD/PII, you should not provide your PD/PII to AW. We may also release your PD/PII to third parties if we believe such release is necessary (i) to comply with the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization), (ii) to apply or enforce our user agreements, (iii) to protect our rights or property, (iv) as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of AW, or (v) if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure of such PD/PII.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>What other information does AW collect?</b><br>
				We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such non-PD/PII for promotional purposes. If you do not want us to track such information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>How do we store information?</b><br>
				While we take commercially reasonable efforts to protect PD/PII provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If any breaches occur, AW will use its best commercial efforts to notify you of the breach in a timely fashion.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Do we transfer information to other nations?</b><br>
				We may transfer PD/PII we have collected about you to someone other than you in a foreign country only if such transfer is conducted in accordance with the principles of the nation in which the PD/PII was collected and of the nation to which the PD/PII may be transferred..<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Does AW provide links to other websites?</b><br>
				We may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your PD/PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this Privacy Policy.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>What are our policies regarding children?</b><br>
				You must be eighteen (18) years of age or older in order to use the Website. AW does not knowingly collect PD/PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>California Privacy Rights</b><br>
				California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows users who are California residents to request information about the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; To make such a request, please contact us by emailing info@advertisingweek.com and using the heading CALIFORNIA PRIVACY DISCLOSURE REQUEST.&nbsp;<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Do we have a mechanism to address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?</b><br>
				If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, please contact us by e-mail at info@advertisingweek.com or write to us at Advertising Week, 131 West 33rd&nbsp;Street, Suite 800, New York, NY 10001, Attention: Privacy Policy.<br>
				&nbsp;<br>
				<b>Acceptance</b><br>
				You accept that your use of this Website includes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.<br>
