<b>Updated February 14, 2006</b>
<br><br>
Protecting your privacy is important to Greenlight Wireless. We 
strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring 
that you are aware of and understand the Greenlight Wireless Privacy 
Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment 
to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal 
information.
<br><br>
<span class="header">Why we collect personal information:</span>
<br>
Greenlight Wireless collects and uses your personal information 
to give you superior customer service and to make a wider range 
of products and services available to you. In addition, we use your 
personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product 
announcements, software updates, special offers, and other information 
we think you'd like to hear about. From time 
to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you 
to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge 
customer satisfaction and develop better products.
<br><br>
<span class="header">How we collect personal information:</span>
<br>
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we 
might ask for your contact information when you correspond with 
us, call us to make a purchase or request service, 
or participate in an online survey. In addition, when 
you register a new Greenlight Wireless service or ask to be included 
in an e-mail mailing list, we collect and store the information you 
provide in a secure database.
<br><br>
At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose 
your personal information. We may also disclose information about 
you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.
<br><br>
<span class="header">How we protect your personal information:</span><br>
Greenlight Wireless safeguards the security of the data you send 
us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge 
you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when 
you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination 
of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.
<br><br>
Greenlight Wireless uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer 
(SSL) encryption on all Web pages where personal information is 
required. To make purchases from us, you must use an SSL-enabled 
browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. 
This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card 
information while it is transmitted over the Internet. In order 
to protect your privacy and provide the highest possible security, 
Greenlight Wireless does NOT retain a record of credit card numbers 
used during sign up processes. Partial credit card information is 
maintained on a secure database, however, for use in the event of 
a reimbursement or refund.
<br><br>
<span class="header">Collecting other personal information:</span>
<br>
When you browse the Greenlight Wireless Web site, you are able to 
do so anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information 
when you browse—not even your e-mail address. Your browser, however, 
does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system 
you are using.
<br><br>
In some of our e-mail to you, we use a "click-through URL." When 
you click one of these URLs, you pass through our Web server before 
arriving at the Web site that is your destination. We track click-throughs 
to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure 
the effectiveness of our customer communications.
<br><br>
Greenlight Wireless does not knowingly solicit personal information 
from children or send them requests for personal information.
<br><br>
The Greenlight Wireless Web site contains links to other sites. 
Greenlight Wireless does not share your personal information with 
those Web sites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. 
We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.
<br><br>
If we are going to use your personal information differently from 
that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you 
via e-mail using the most recent information we have. If you have 
not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be 
contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.
<br><br>
The Greenlight Wireless Privacy Policy is subject to change at any 
time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
