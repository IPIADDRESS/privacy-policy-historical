At Advanta Bank Corp., we recognize that our business customers and other business visitors are concerned about privacy. We want you to be confident that we make every effort to safeguard the security and confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information.

maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
