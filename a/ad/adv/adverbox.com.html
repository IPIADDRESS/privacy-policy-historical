      Some ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by Google, among other services.

      <p><strong>Business Transitions</strong><br>
        In the event AdverBox goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
