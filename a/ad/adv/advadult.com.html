			<div class="BoxOutline">

<p>Welcome to the <b>www.sexyadv.com</b> website run by
Ambroworks,LLC (the <b>"Company," "we,"
"us,"</b> or <b>"our"</b>). The Company is
committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all
users of our website (the <b>"Site"</b>) (we refer to
the Site and the services we provide as described in our Site
collectively as the <b>"Company Features"</b>). As such,
we have established and implemented this privacy statement to
inform visitors to the Site and users of the Company Features how
we use and protect the information we collect. If you have any
questions regarding this information or our privacy practices,
please see the section entitled <b>"Questions? Contact Us"</b>
at the end of this privacy statement. This privacy statement is
effective as of May 1, 2008. </p>

<p><b>What information does theCompany collect?</b></p>

<p>The Company does not collect personally identifiable
information unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. We
do, however, collect certain types of information and ask for
personal information in certain circumstances, such as when you
set up an account. The following sections describe what type of
information we collect, when we collect it and how we use it. </p>

<p><b>Setting up an account</b></p>

<p>In order to use certain functionality of the Company Features,
you will have to create a user account which requires you to
submit certain personal information. When you register and create
an account, we require you to provide us your name, postal
address, telephone number, and email address. If you are buying
ads we require information about how you will pay for the ads
with either credit card information &amp;ndash credit card number
and billing address.. If you are publishing ads then we also ask
for certain information about your web site and which method we
should use to pay you, e.g. check or Epassporte or wire transfer.
If a publisher is based in the USA we are required to collect
certain tax ID information. Upon activating an account, you will
select a password. Your email address and password will be used
so you can securely access and maintain your account</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>Cookies are small bits of
electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor&amp;rsquos
hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to
the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many
web sites use them. Cookies allow web site operators to better
customize visits to the site to the visitor&amp;rsquos individual
preferences. For example, by setting a cookie you would not have
to enter information in the Site more than once, thereby saving
time. We do not receive or record any personal information in the
cookies we use. </p>

<p>Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you
can usually change your browser to prevent that or to notify you
when you are sent a cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you
can still access the Company Features.</p>

<p><b>Electronic Information</b></p>

<p>In the course of using the Site we automatically collect
information such as IP address, browser type, referrer URL and
other technical data.</p>

<p><b>Customer Service</b></p>

<p>We provide customer service support through email and phone.
In order to provide customer support, we will ask for your email
address. Aside from this information, we do not ask for any
personal information to provide customer support. We only use
information received from customer support requests, including
email addresses, for customer support services and we do not
transfer or share this information with any third parties. </p>

<p><b>How do we use the information you provide us? </b></p>

<p>We use your personal information such as your name, address,
billing and mailing address and credit card number for billing
purposes when we charge you for the use of your account. We also
will use your email address or phone number to contact you when
we provide customer support. </p>

<p>We use your email address to inform advertisers about the
performance of their ads and to inform publishers about any ads
that they have sold. </p>

<p>In addition, from time to time, we may also use your email
address to send you information on updates to the Company
Features, or if you choose to be included, to alert you to
offerings from other companies that we are affiliated with. To
opt in to receiving these emails, please see the section below
titled <b>"How do you opt in?"</b> We will not ever
sell your email address or send you offerings from companies that
we are not affiliated with.</p>

<p>We may also provide aggregated information about our visitors
to outside parties from time to time. For further details, please
see the section below titled <b>"Does Company disclose the
information it collects to outside parties?" </b></p>

<p>We may use the information we collect to optimize our Site,
for internal research, to provide information in the aggregate to
advertisers about the performance of ads, and to tailor your
experience through the Company Features by displaying content
according to your interests and preferences, providing a faster
method for you to access your account and submit information to
us and allowing us to contact you, if necessary. </p>

<p><b>How does Company protect customer information? </b></p>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the
security of your personal information on our systems. User
personal information is contained behind secured networks and is
only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special
access rights to such systems. Any credit card information you
supply us is transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer
technology (&amp;ldquoSSL&amp;rdquo) and HTTPS protocol and then
stored into our databases to be accessed only as stated above. </p>

<p><b>Does Company disclose the information it collects from its
visitors to outside parties? </b></p>

<p>We do not currently sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside
the Company personally identifiable information that visitors
voluntarily provide in any account registration. This information
is used to better understand how visitors use the Site, to
support related transactions made on the site, and to better know
our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features,
promotions, or other notifications to them. However, this data,
in an aggregate form without any personally identifiable
information, may be provided to other parties (including
advertisers) for marketing, advertising, or other uses, including
assessing the effectiveness of their ads. Should you change your
mind about the information you&amp;rsquove provided to us, should
you no longer wish to receive information from us, or should your
information change, we have provided a way for you to correct,
update or remove the personal data you gave us. For further
details please see the section below titled </p>

<p><b>"How do you change the information we have for you?"
</b></p>

<p>In the event Company goes through a business transition, such
as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a
portion of its assets, visitors&amp;rsquo information will, in
most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Visitors will
be notified via prominent notice on the Site for 30 days prior to
a change of ownership or control of information of users held by
us. If as a result of the business transition, information will
be used for a purpose different from that stated, or implied at
the time of collection users will be given a choice consistent
with our notification of changes section. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other term of this privacy statement,
we may release any personal information we obtain or collect when
we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law,
enforce our Site policies, or protect ours or others&amp;rsquo
rights, property, or safety.</p>

<p><b>How do you opt in? </b></p>

<p>In order to opt in to receiving email notifications and
updates, please access the "My Account" area of the
Site and you may select the <b>"Please send me email updates
and notifications"</b> option. </p>

<p><b>How do you change the information we have for you? </b></p>

<p>To update, modify or delete the information that we have on
file for your account, simply go to the "My Account"
section of the Site, log in, and modify your details and settings
as necessary. To reduce the occurrence of unauthorized access to
your account information, we strongly urge you to periodically
change your password. Please note that we require some personal
information for billing purposes. If you wish to delete your name,
telephone number, email address, billing or mailing address or
credit card number, you will be required to terminate your
account. </p>

<p><b>Third party links and co-brand relationships. </b></p>

<p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, we
may choose various third party web sites to link to, and frame
within, the Site. We also participate in co-branding and other
relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features
to our visitors. However, even if the third party is affiliated
with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of
which has separate privacy and data collection practices
independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or
third party web sites (even if offered on or through our site)
may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or
liability for these independent policies or actions, and are not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such
web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and
you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek
to protect the integrity of the Company Features and the links
placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback on
not only the Company Features, but for sites each links to as
well (including if a specific link does not work). </p>

<p><b>Children&amp;rsquos Online Privacy Protection Act. </b></p>

<p>Our Site is not intended for use by children, or any person
under the age of 18. Consequently, if you are not at least 18
years of age, please do not use our Site or open an account. </p>

<p><b>Notification of changes. </b></p>

<p>By visiting the Site or using the Company Features, you
consent to the collection and use of information by us as set
forth in this privacy statement. If we decide to change our
privacy statement, we will post those changes within this page so
our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p>

dealings with the Company Features, please do not hesitate to
