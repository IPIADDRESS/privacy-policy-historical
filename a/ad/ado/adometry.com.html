    <a name="collection"><h2>Information Collected and How it is Used</h2></a>
    <h3>Information collected if you only browse this site</h3>
    <p>If you do nothing during your visit to our web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally. The following information about your visit is automatically collected and stored:</p>
<ol><li>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g. xcompany.com or yourschool.edu).</li>
<li>The type of browser and operating system you used.</li>
<li>The date and time you visited this site.</li>
<li>The web pages or services you accessed at this site.</li>
<li>The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site.</li></ol>
<p>The information automatically collected is logged and used by Adometry only to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how individuals are using our services. Adometry analyzes this information to determine how our web site is being used so that we may continually improve the site's usefulness. </p>

    <p>You may choose whether or not to provide personal information online. ”Personal information“ is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not necessarily considered personal information.
Adometry does not collect personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us by sending us email, participating in a survey, or completing an online form. Your decision not to participate in these activities will not impair your ability to browse the Adometry web site and read or download any information provided on the site. If you choose to not use online applications, forms, or services, you still have the ability to contact Adometry by mail, fax, or telephone. Please refer to the <a href="#contact">Contact Information Section</a>.</p> 
<p>If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact Adometry, as shown in the <a href="#contact">Contact Information Section</a> of this statement.</p>
<p>The Adometry web site is a general audience site and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult. <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

	<a name="nondisclosure"><h2>Nondisclosure of Certain Personal Information</h2></a>
    <p>Adometry may require you to provide certain confidential information in order to use specific online services. This information is required to verify a user's identity. You may choose not to give this information, but if you choose not, we will be unable to provide you access to these online services and you will have to use traditional methods such as personal contact, fax, or mail.
Our strict confidentiality standards prohibit Adometry from disclosing personal information about you without express consent unless required by law. <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>

	<a name="review"><h2>Review and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information</h2></a>
    <p>You can review any personally identifiable information Adometry collects about you by using the information in the <a href="#contact">Contact Information Section</a> at the end of this Notice. You may recommend changes to your personally identifiable information you believe to be inaccurate by submitting a written and signed request that explains the inaccuracy. Adometry will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. <a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
