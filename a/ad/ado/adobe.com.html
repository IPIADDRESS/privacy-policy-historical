When you visit Adobe.com, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information about Adobe's products without revealing your identity.  At times, particularly when you order products, download software, or enter contests from the Adobe Web site, Adobe may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.  It is completely optional for you to participate in these programs.  If you elect to participate in these programs, however, Adobe may require that you provide your contact information, which may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address or other personally identifying information.  When you submit personal information to Adobe, you understand and agree that Adobe and its affiliates may access, store, and use your customer profile in any of the countries in which Adobe and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation the United States. We collect this information for a variety of reasons, including Adobe's effort to inform you of product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services from Adobe.  Adobe recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of the information you choose to provide.<p>  

Adobe may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations whose products or services we think may interest you.  If you do not want the information you provide to Adobe to be shared with other companies and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to Adobe, Adobe will honor your preference.</p><p>

In order to improve our Web site, Adobe uses "cookies" to track your visit to the Adobe Web site.  A cookie, which is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you, functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences.  It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.  (For some Web pages which require authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will likely not be able to access those pages.)  While Adobe uses cookies to track your visit to Adobe.com and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Adobe with personal information.</p><p>   

You can help Adobe to maintain the accuracy of the information you provide by notifying us of any change to your address, phone number, e-mail address or other information by writing to us at Adobe Systems Incorporated, Attn: Order Management Change of Address, 411 First Avenue S, Seattle, WA 98104.  If you do not want Adobe to share your contact information with our third-party partners and you did not opt-out when you registered initially with Adobe, you may submit this request to the same address. Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us.  Although no specific form is required to notify Adobe of changes of your address or privacy preference, you may order a Change of Address form (Doc. No. 416913) from Adobe's Fax-On-Demand Support at 206-675-6137.</p><p>

By using this site, you agree to the terms of the Adobe Online Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this site.  Adobe is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of non-Adobe Web sites to which Adobe.com or any other Adobe Web site may link.
