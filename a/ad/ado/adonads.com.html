<h4>
Privacy Statement
</h4>
This Privacy Policy applies to certain websites that are owned and/or
operated by or on behalf of Adonads.com, and/or other affiliated entities
controlled by, or under common control with, such parties (each such web
site being individually referred to herein as the "Web Site"). If you have
arrived at this Privacy Policy by "clicking" on an authorized link from
a Web Site, then this Privacy Policy applies to such Web Site, and the
individual entity that owns and/or operates the particular Web Site from
which you "clicked" to. This Privacy Policy via an authorized link shall
be referred to herein as "Sponsor," “we” or “us.”
Sponsor respects the privacy of its users, and this Privacy Policy explains
what information we collect on our Web Site and how we use such information.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, as it acts as an official Terms
of Use statement, which governs your use of the Web Site. Your use of our
Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy practices,
as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
Applicability
</h4>
Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to Web Sites owned and/or
operated by or for Sponsor, and upon which Sponsor has placed a "link"
which, when "clicked", transfers you to this Privacy Policy. It is not
applicable to the individual web sites owned, sponsored or operated by
or for any independent television or radio stations affiliated with Sponsor.
While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to these or other web sites
or online material. If you “click” on a link to such a third
party, the “click” takes you off our Web Site and to a third
party's web site, which is beyond Sponsor's control. These other web sites
may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy
policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the
Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web
site or offline by Sponsor (unless otherwise specifically stated or disclosed
by Sponsor), its corporate affiliates, broadcast affiliates, licensees
or any other company, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy
of any other web site you visit.
<br>
<br>
In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any
information you may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards,
or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly
disclose information about yourself online-for example, via message boards
or chat rooms-that information could be collected and used by people
that you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user
forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with the message
poster's name and message. Sponsor bears no responsibility for any action
or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may
disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any,
on the Web Site.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
Information Sponsor Collects
</h4>
<strong>
Personally Identifiable Information:
</strong>
Personally identifiable information is information that could reasonably
be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, birth date
or e-mail address), which we refer to in this Privacy Policy as “PII.”
Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing us with PII. However,
there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PII, such
as when you choose to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters
or choose to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting
procedure. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information
or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information.
Sponsor reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site
that require you to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit
card information, or to require registration to access our Web Site. You
can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be
able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Web Site's features.
We may combine the information we collect with information available from
other sources, including information received from promotional partners
or other third parties. We may provide you the opportunity to e-mail a
friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from
our Web Site. The e-mail addresses you supply us for those activities will
be used to send the requested e-mail and will not be used to send you or
your friend any other e-mail communications.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
The Web Site does not knowingly collect PII from children under thirteen
(13) years of age:
</strong>
This is not a web site directed to children under the age of 13, and Sponsor
does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years
of age at the Web Site. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any
information about yourself to Sponsor. If Sponsor discovers that a child
under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with PII, Sponsor will delete
that child's PII from its system.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Anonymous Information:
</strong>
When you visit the Web Site, our web servers automatically collect web
site usage information. Web site usage information is anonymous information
that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes
the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length and
depth of their stays. We collect the anonymous information automatically
sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that
identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web
Site, and IP address. We also may determine what technology is available
through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version
of a web page. For example, we may determine that you have installed a
version of Flash, and we will then send you the appropriate Flash version
of the web page rather than an HTML page.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
IP Addresses:
</strong>
An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network
when you are on the Internet. When visitors request pages from our Web
Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address. We may collect IP addresses
for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report
aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number of
visits to different pages on our Web Site. Please note that some services
within our Web Site, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses
along with the message poster's name and message.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Cookies:
</strong>
Cookies are information files that our Web Site may place on your computer
to provide extended functionality and to personalize your experience at
our Web Site. We may use cookies for a number of purposes. For example,
we may use cookies to track usage patterns on the Web Site and we may use
cookies to serve relevant ads based on your expressed interests on websites
within our network of online publishers. Or, we may use cookies to record
registration and personalization information, enabling you to save your
user name and password. We do not store any PII in cookies, but we may
link the cookie to any information we collect. You can, of course, disable
cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options
menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of the Web
Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult
with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding
disabling cookies.
<br>
<br>
<h4>
Sponsor's Use and Disclosure of Collected Information
</h4>
<strong>
Sponsor:
</strong>
Sponsor may use your PII to provide the information or content you have
requested, to contact you or to fulfill prizes in connection with a contest
or sweepstakes, to contact you about Sponsor programs, products, features
or services, or for other purposes disclosed at the time of collection.
We may also use your PII to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site
or changes to our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use or other policy or terms
that affect you and your use of our Web Site. If you e-mail someone else
an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from our
Web Site, we will use the information you provide about someone else to
send that person the requested e-mail. Sponsor may use information collected
about our users to improve the content and navigation of our Web Site,
or for other internal purposes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Third parties providing services on our behalf:
</strong>
Sponsor may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions
on its behalf. Examples may include hosting the Web Site, sending communications
on our behalf, hosting message boards or other user forums, analyzing data,
providing marketing assistance, creating, hosting and/or running contests/sweepstakes/games
and providing customer service. These third parties may have access to
our users' PII in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf,
but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Other Third Parties:
</strong>
Sponsor may disclose anonymous, aggregated user statistics to third parties
for a variety of purposes. For example, we may disclose how many individuals
visited certain areas of our Web Site, or how many men or women receive
our newsletter. Sponsor does not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your
PII to third parties unless disclosed to you at the time such information
is collected or unless you otherwise give consent, other than in the following
limited circumstances:
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Legal action:
</strong>
Sponsor may disclose information about its users, including PII, when
legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting
an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing
our Web Site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized
use of our Web Site. Sponsor may also disclose user information whenever
we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability, to protect
or defend our rights or property or protect the safety, rights or property
of our users.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Corporate change:
</strong>
Sponsor may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose user information, including
PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation,
the sale of substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change
respecting the Web Site.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Security:
</strong>
Sponsor takes steps to secure the data you submit to us, including limiting
the number of people who have physical access to our user data. Unfortunately,
no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, Sponsor cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
you transmit to Sponsor and you do so at your own risk. That said, all
financial transactions completed through the Web Site use the most sophisticated
e-commerce software and hardware Adonads.com can provide, to ensure the
utmost security for all users.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Consent to Transfer:
</strong>
The Web Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the
European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware
that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United
States. By using our Web Site, participating in any of our services and/or
providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
Acceptance / Changes to Privacy Policy:
</strong>
By using the Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Sponsor reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy
Policy at any time in its sole discretion. We will post any changes here,
so be sure to check back from time to time. However, we will only use the
PII you provide to the Web Site in a manner consistent with this Privacy
Policy, unless you give us your consent.
<br>
