<h2 class="main-title">AD MAVEN PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<h3 class="tcenter" style="font-size:12pt">This Privacy Policy (the “PP”) applies to User’s use of Ad-Maven.com (the "Site"), and any software, products and service offered by Ad Maven through the Site, or otherwise (if any) (the “Product(s)”). The Product(s) and the Site shall be referred to, collectively, as the “Software”, and this document set forth the privacy policies Ad Maven practices in the Software. This PP is an integral part of Ad Maven’s Terms of Use (available at <a href="http://ad-maven.com/terms.html">www.ad-maven.com/terms.html</a>) (the “TOU”), and both PP and TOU shall be binding upon any user using or attempting to use the Software or any portion thereof (“User”). If you do not wish to bound by this PP and/or the TOU, exit the Site and/or terminate your usage (or attempt to use) of the Product(s). 
Ad Maven may collect certain information about User's web usage and sites User's has visited, which may be shared with third parties and used for advertising. 
<br>
<br>
<b>1.	Non-personally Identifiable Information. </b>
<br>
1.1.	Ad Maven and/or third parties utilizing its Software or to which Ad Maven allows access to the information gathered by the Software ("Third Parties") may collect non-personally identifiable information about Users. Non-personal identifiable information may include the User's browser name, internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), the type of Internet device the User's use and technical specifications of such device (such as the operating system and the Internet service such User utilize and other similar information) and other information of technical nature (such as date/time stamp, and clickstream data) or other information except for the defined below PII.
<br>
1.2.	Ad Maven does not always have access or control over Third Parties information collection mechanisms, and such Third Parties practices are not covered by this PP but by the applicable policies set forth in such Third Parties Websites or products.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.	Personal Identifiable Information.</b>
<br>
2.1.	Ad Maven and/or Third Parties may collect PII (as defined below) from Users if such Users voluntarily submit such information. PII may be voluntary provided in a variety of ways, such as when Users visit the Site, register on the Site, place an order, subscribe to the newsletter, respond to a survey, and fill out a form. User is advised that by providing Ad Maven PII User gives his consent to Ad Maven to make use of such PII. PII - “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information which might reasonably be used to specifically identify User and may include, among other, User's name, title, company, address, email. 
<br>
2.2.	If PII is collected by Ad Maven, User is at any time entitled, under the Israeli Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, whether himself or through a proxy so authorized in writing or through his/her legal guardian, to peruse information pertaining to him/herself that is stored in a database. Having perused such information and found it to be inaccurate, incomplete, unclear or out of date, such a person may contact the database owner and request to correct, amend or delete the data in question. Had the database owner refused to permit access or comply with a request to amend or delete information, the applicant may appeal to a magistrate’s court as stipulated by applicable regulations.
<br>
2.3.	Moreover, should the information contained in the database be used for purposes of personally soliciting User, based on User's affiliation to any population group as determined according to one or more attributes of people whose names are included in the database (“solicitation for commercial purposes”), the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, entitles User to submit a written request that such information pertaining to the User be deleted from the database. In such a case, the Website management will delete any information required for solicitation for commercial purposes as stated above. Please note that deleting such information might prevent User from continuing to receive services from us.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.	Tracking Technologies and Use and Setting of Digital Identifiers. </b>
<br>
3.1.	Digital identifier is information a site may put on User's hard disk so that this information and other related information may be utilized by such site at later time. No PII is collected Ad Maven by the use of such digital identifiers. Ad Maven and/or Third Parties collect and use the information collected through such digital identifiers for purposes such as to security purposes, analyzing trends, administrating the Site, tracking movement of Users on the Site and gather aggregate demographic information.
<br>
3.2.	One of the digital identifiers the Software utilizes is called a "cookies". "Cookies" are small piece of data sent by the Software and stored in a User's web browser while User is browsing Internet Websites. Every time User loads a Website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server and notifies Ad Maven of User's previous Internet activity. The Cookies are placed on Users hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about Users' internet usage. User may choose to set their web browser to refuse Cookies, or to alert when cookies are being sent. User is advised that if User chooses to activate such Cookies refusal cookie alert functionalities, the Software may not function properly.
<br>
3.3.	Ad Maven and/or Third Parties employ sometime a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help Ad Maven and/or Third Parties better manage content on our site by informing Ad Maven what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are very small in size. Ad maven does not gather PII by clear gifs.
<br>
<br>
<b>4.	Opt-out Option. </b>
More information about Cookies and other ‘digital identifiers’ used by Ad Maven and/or Third Parties, and the ability to configure them is available through the links below. Ad-Maven utilizes AppNexus, amongst other adservers, as a 3rd party tool in order to deliver and track ads. In order to opt out of AppNexus 3rd party cookies, please visit: <a href="http://appnexus.com//platform-policy">http://appnexus.com//platform-policy</a>.
<br>User may delete or Opt-Out of any third party ad technology, i.e. 'digital identifiers’ cookie, web beacon, or any other tracking mechanism used for data collection according to the instruction provided in

<br>
4.2.	If technology is not a member of the NAI, users may clear their browser cookies by following these instructions, found at:
