          MediaWhiz Holdings, LLC.. and its affiliated companies (“we” 
          or “us”) operate a series of websites offering a variety 
          of products and services (a “Site” or the "Sites"). 
          This notice outlines the privacy policies of the Sites. By visiting 
          this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy 
          Policy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Changes 
          to the Privacy Policy</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We reserve the right 
          to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Since any changes will be 
          posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly. 
          Your continued use of the Sites following any changes to this Privacy 
          Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Your IP 
          Address</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each time you visit 
          the Sites, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and 
          the Web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help identify 
          you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use 
          your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer 
          the Sites, and to better serve you in using the services and features 
          of the Sites. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cookies 
          and Action Tags</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first time a 
          user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities 
          at a Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address 
          and deploy a cookie to the user's PC. Whenever that user comes back 
          to a Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify 
          the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a 
          user provides other information in connection with their activities 
          on a Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may 
          store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our 
          user database. We may use the information stored in our database (i) 
          for the purpose for which the information was originally provided by 
          a user, (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user 
          wishes to sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers 
          in the future, (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed 
          to the same ads, offers and promotions while visiting Sites, and (iv) 
          to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, 
          promotions or advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest 
          to that user. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Action Tags, Web 
          Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon 
          (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track 
          responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or 
          other information on a site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded 
          in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. 
          We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click 
          on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide 
          information about what products are viewed or purchased. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Personal 
          Information We Collect From You</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While on the Site 
          we may collect personal information from you. Personal information may 
          include information you provide to us while registering with a Site, 
          making purchases, or as otherwise requested on the Site, such as your 
          name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. Personal information 
          may also include information we gather about you while on a Site such 
          as your purchase history. If you place an order with us, our order forms 
          require that you provide financial information (like your account or 
          credit card numbers) as well. We may also collect demographic information 
          that you provide to us such as your zip code, age, or income level.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How We Use 
          Personal Information</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will use your 
          personal information for customer service, to provide you with information 
          that you may request, to customize your experience on a Site, and to 
          contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into 
          by you on a Site. We may also use your personal information for internal 
          business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may 
          also combine the information we have gathered about you with information 
          from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our 
          business and the Sites or administer activities on our behalf, such 
          as authorization of credit card transactions, and order fulfillment. 
          We may share your information with these third parties for those limited 
          purposes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, unless 
          a user has elected not to receive our offers and third-party offers 
          and promotions or to limit or prohibit disclosure of information about 
          them, we may provide individual user information to our advertising 
          and marketing partners, our affiliated companies, or other third parties 
          interested in marketing to our Sites’ users. We make an effort 
          to provide users and subscribers with ads and offers that they may find 
          of interest and of some value. Nevertheless, it is our policy to allow 
          users to make the choices about, and to control, the information our 
          Sites collect and the manner in which that information is used. For 
          this reason, users always have the ability to update, change or delete 
          information about them collected by the Sites, to unsubscribe from any 
          mailing list at any time, to opt out of receiving third-party ads, promotions 
          and offers, and to prevent disclosure of their information to third-parties 
          for such purposes. We reserve the right to, in connection with a transfer 
          of any of our assets to any affiliated company, provide user information 
          and data to the affiliate subject to the terms of this policy. Similarly, 
          we reserve the right to, in connection with a sale of any of our assets 
          or businesses to a third party, sell our customer database, or relevant 
          portion thereof, so that a third-party may be able to continue to provide 
          the services and features to which our users have subscribed. We may 
          release user information if required by law, to enforce any terms of 
          service, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Sites, 
          its registered users, or others. Please note that our privacy policy 
          does not apply to websites or web pages that link to our Sites. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may, at any 
          time, notify us that you do not wish to have your personal information 
          disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail 
          to <a href="mailto:privacy@mediawhiz.com">privacy@mediawhiz.com</a>.

          Financial Information</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Financial information 
          is used to bill you for products and services. By making a purchase 
          on a Site, you consent to our providing your financial information to 
          our service providers and to such third parties as we determine is necessary 
          to process your transactions. These third parties may include the credit 
          card companies and banking institutions used to process the transaction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How We Use 
          Demographic Information </strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We use demographic 
          information to tailor Sites to the interests of our users. Demographic 
          information is shared with advertisers so that they can tailor their 
          advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information 
          may also be shared with other third parties.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Other Sites</strong></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other sites accessible 
          through our Sites have their own privacy policies and data collection, 
          use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. 
          We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. 
          Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the 
          Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information 
          practices of those websites linked to our Sites are not covered by this 
          Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, 
          collect data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies 
          that place advertising on our Sites may collect information about you 
          when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. 
          We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact 
          these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use 
          of the information that they collect. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On behalf of various 
          sponsors, we may provide sponsored links to third-party websites. If 
          you click on a sponsored link or banner ad, a "window" or 
          "frame" containing a third-party's web site may appear in 
          the foreground with a Site in the background. Unless you are on one 
          of our Sites, any time that you have moved to a window, you should assume 
          that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed 
          in accordance with the windowed site's privacy policy (if any). If you 
          are unsure as to whose privacy policy applies, please contact us by

          misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We encrypt 
          all of your personal and financial information and use our best efforts

          transactions database, which may have already been shared with third 
          parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. You will need
