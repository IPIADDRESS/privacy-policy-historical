      <p><b><font size="4">Anchorage Daily News PRIVACY POLICY</font></b> 
      </p><p>Anchorage Daily News has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy 
        concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them. That 
        is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position 
        on information-gathering and disclosure. 
      </p><p><!--[TRUSTe Certified] TO BE ADDED AT A LATER DATE, WHEN ATTAINED--> 
      </p><p><b>Your Personal Information</b> 
      </p><p>From time to time, we will ask for information that personally identifies 
        you, as in our user surveys or registration for Anchorage Daily News services 
        such as e-mail, forums, or promotions. We use this information to operate 
        Anchorage Daily News's services, provide you with the highest quality 
        services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest. 
      </p><p>We will <b>not</b> disclose any personal information without your advance 
        permission except when we believe the law requires us to do so or the 
        disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of Anchorage 
        Daily News, or as explained below or in our <a href="usragr.html">User 
        Agreement</a>. 
      </p><p>In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers 
        and others, we may disclose user information but only in a form that does 
        <b>not</b> identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that 
        a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range. 
      </p><p>Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, 
        but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the 
        information the purpose for which it will be disclosed. 
      </p><p><b>Kids' Privacy</b> 
      </p><p>Anchorage Daily News is particularly concerned with providing a safe 
        online environment for kids. Therefore, in areas operated by Anchorage 
        Daily News that are directed to kids or when we learn that a user is under 
        the age of 13, we will ask for parental consent before collecting additional 
        personal information about the child or allowing the child to use the 
        Anchorage Daily News services to provide additional personal information. 
        Parental consent can be provided in two ways: 
      </p><ol>
        <li>Send a fax copy of a completed Parental Consent Form, including your 
          signature, to the facsimile number provided on the <a href="parental_consent.html">Parental 
          Consent Form</a> (which will be provided in applicable areas on our 
          site); or 
        </li><li>Call our toll-free number at the telephone number provided on the 
          Parental Consent Form. 
      </li></ol>
      <p>Anchorage Daily News will not knowingly disclose personal information 
        about users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except 
        as required by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove 
        information about your child or terminate your child's account, you may 
        fax or call Anchorage Daily News at the numbers listed above or send an 
        e-mail to <a href="mailto:marketing@adn.com">marketing@adn.com</a>.
      </p><p>Anchorage Daily News strongly recommends parental supervision when a 
        child uses the Internet, and particularly when a child enters a forum 
        or uses e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not 
        to give out personal information in these areas. 
      </p><p><b>E-Commerce</b>
      </p><p> Anchorage Daily News hosts a number of online stores that sell a variety 
        of goods and services. These stores may collect information from you such 
        as your name, credit card number and other contact information. Anchorage 
        Daily News does not collect, use or disclose this information nor does 
        it own or control the stores or have responsibility for transactions made 
        by those merchants. If you would like to know more about the information 
        collected when you participate in e-commerce on or through this site, 
        please contact the store merchants directly. 
      </p><p><b>Cookies</b> 
      </p><p>A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your browser and 
        allows Anchorage Daily News to recognize you each time you visit this

        Anchorage Daily News does not use cookies to collect personal information.

        to your interests. 
      </p><p><b>Direct Mailings and "Opting Out"</b> 
      </p><p>We may send you information about various products and services. If you 
        don't want to receive this information, you can "opt out" by sending us 
        an e-mail at <a href="mailto:marketing@adn.com">marketing@adn.com</a>

      </p><p><b>Remember The Risks Whenever You Use The Internet</b> 
      </p><p>You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information 
        on the Anchorage Daily News system (for example, in forums), that information 
        can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages 
        from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information, 
        we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit 
        to Anchorage Daily News and you are solely responsible for maintaining 
        the secrecy of any passwords or other account information. In addition, 
        our partners and other Internet sites or services that may be accessible 
        through Anchorage Daily News have separate data and privacy practices 
        independent of us, and therefore we disclaim any responsibility or liability 
        for their policies or actions. Please contact those vendors and others 
        directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies.
