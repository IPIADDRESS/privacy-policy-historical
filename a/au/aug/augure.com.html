<h2><b><a name="What"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal data (“<b>Personal Data</b>”) gathered when you are using or accessing augure.launchmetrics.com (the “<b>Site</b>”) and other interactions (e.g., customer services inquiries, newsletter, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“</span><b>Third Party Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Augure and its affiliates, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;"><b><a style="color: #3366ff;" name="Information"></a>What Information Do We Collect and Receive?</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Site. In connection with certain aspects of the Site, we may request, collect and/or display</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of your Personal Data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect the following types of information from our users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Usage Information:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically.&nbsp;</strong>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Site, including your IP address and Cookie information. Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that we can analyze and improve them.</li>
<li><strong>Log Data.&nbsp;</strong>We do not have website “logs” as our Site is totally open. You will need to leave Personal Data only for downloading content or for request of information on our Site. A checkbox will be available on every online form you complete to make sure you consent to give us such Personal Data.</li>
<li><strong>Device Identifiers.</strong>&nbsp;When you access the Site by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Site. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. Some features of the Site and Site may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
<li><strong>Location Data</strong>.&nbsp;When you access the Site by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Site and Site. Some features of the Site, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Information</strong>.&nbsp;We collect statistical information about how, collectively, users use the Site (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Data. This statistical information cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p><b> </b> <span style="color: #333333;"><b>Cookies Information:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Cookies and similar technologies in our Sites and Services that help us collect other information. The Sites and Services may also include Cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect information about you via the Sites and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our <a href="http://auguresl.wpengine.com/cookies-policy">Cookies Policy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><b>Contact Information:</b></span><b><br>
</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you submit an inquiry through the Site, we may collect Personal Data such as your first and last name, your current job and employer, your email address and telephone number and the country where you are currently located.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you submit an inquiry containing contact information you will be asked to tick a checkbox so we are sure that you understand the reason why we may collect such information and you will also be provided with a link to this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to improve the type of content you receive through our subscription channels, we use in our contact &amp; content forms a feature that is called ‘Progressive Profiling’. It is the tool we use for marketing automation and it records your visit through Session Cookies. Once your IP is identified, the type of information that we ask you through our forms may vary when you access or download content two or more times on our website. In this way, your profile in our CRM platform is progressively enriched and allows us to offer you a unique and personalized experience through our emails according to your profile and interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you submit an inquiry, you will always be asked for permission before we send </span><b>marketing communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (e.g. newsletters and Discover coverage newsletter, campaign emails, etc). If you DO NOT wish anymore to receive marketing communication from us, please send us an email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprotection@launchmetrics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dataprotection@<wbr>launchmetrics.com</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or directly unsubscribe from marketing communication by clicking on the unsubscribe link. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are free to explore the Site without providing any Personal Data about yourself but some information may be collected automatically, and if some information, such as account details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid features such as the ‘Progressive Profiling’ of our forms, you can always perform your browsing in incognito mode (more info </span><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) &nbsp;or deactivate your browser Cookies (Check our <a href="http://auguresl.wpengine.com/cookies-policy">Cookies Policy </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2><b><a name="Data"></a><span style="color: #3366ff;">How Do We Use the Data Collected?</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Personal Data will be used by Augure in accordance with your instructions, including any applicable terms in agreements and use of Services functionality, and as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">required by Applicable Laws. Your Personal Data include the data communicated by you when using the forms on the site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different Augure entities provide the Services in different parts of the world. Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions differentiate between the “controller” and “processor” of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augure/Launchmetrics is the data controller of the data processing involving your Personal Data collected through our Site. The purpose of this data processing is to provide you with our Services and to facilitate your navigation on our website as explained below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the Personal Data you provide to us to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enable us to provide you with the Services and information offered through the Site and which you request;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyse use of the Site and the people visiting in order to improve our content and services including research into our users’ demographics;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitate your navigation of our Site;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including receipt of marketing communications, provided you have indicated that you want to be contacted for this purpose.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">Public Information about Your Activity on the Site:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of your activity on and through the Site may be public by default. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may include, but is not limited to, content you may post publicly on the Site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information concerning your use of the Site (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of Cookies and stored by us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Data using certain network features of the Site, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be available to others. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Site.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>IP Address Information:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public. We do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Information Shared with Analytical Services:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use certain</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">analytics providers (including but not limited to Google Analytics, Inspectlet, Google Optimize, Hotjar) in order to better understand how the Site is used and how it can be improved. Your IP address information may be accessed by one or more of such analytics providers. In addition, information regarding the usage activity of a certain portion of users of the Site may be shared, but such information is shared on an anonymous basis and does not reveal the identity of any individual User. These providers do not collect any personal information or store IP address locally on their websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Aggregate Information:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use the Site and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how the Site interface with them.
