We may store this data along with your PII and other information about your use of our Service.  We use this information to allow you (and us) to operate and monitor your device and our Service.</p>
								<p>If you enable the auto unlock feature, the application will track your location using GPS in order to determine when your application nears august locks that you have permission to unlock (e.g. when you are near home).  This information will only be stored on your device, and not on our servers.  This information will tell your mobile device to start listening for your lock more often (increasing the polling).  This improves the lock’s performance and saves your mobile device’s battery life.</p>

                                        <p>As part of our Services, you may give others (“guests”) permission to access your august lock – e.g. to unlock and lock your door (and possibly even to pass this access along to others).  Needless to say, you must be careful of the guests that you invite and the access that you give them. You are responsible for all uses of your account, so be careful to secure this information and only give access to people you trust.</p>
										<p>Additionally, certain of your PII, device and Service information may be shared with the people that you invite, such as your name and lock location, and the status of the lock (e.g. locked or unlocked).   We may also collect PII (as required to use the Service as set forth in this Privacy Policy) about the guests that you invite in order to allow them to have access to your august lock device and Service.  All such information is subject to, and will be used as set forth in, this Privacy Policy.</p>
										<p>We may allow you and your guests to communicate with each other directly or via your virtual guest book, and will use your and their PII for this purpose.  Users can use the guest book to write thank you notes, leave instructions and read comments.  Of course, you are responsible for contributions to the guest book – so use your good judgment about what you share.</p>
										<p>In connection with the guest invitation process, we may ask for access to your contact list.  We will only store information for contacts that you add as guests.  We will only access and store such information with your express consent.  </p>
										<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we may use your information to contact you and provide support or a response.  We also reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
