      <span><span class="maPara1"></span><span class="maBody"><span style="font-family:arial;font-size:14px;">BioInformatics Inc., doing business as AuntMinnie ("AuntMinnie", "we", "us" or "our") grant you permission as a user ("User", "you" or "your") to access and use our sites, software, applications, content, products and services ("Services"), which are owned or licensed by us on the sites <a href="http://www.auntminnie.com">www.auntminnie.com</a> and <a href="http://www.auntminnieeurope.com">www.auntminnieeurope.com</a> and <a href="http://www.auntminniecme.com">www.auntminniecme.com</a> (collectively, the "Sites"). This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Sites and our provision of the Services on which this policy is posted. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY OF OUR SERVICES.
<br><br>
The privacy of our users on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Since AuntMinnie and its related network of Sites and Services gather certain types of information about our users, we feel that you should completely understand the conditions and terms surrounding the gathering and use of information about those using our Sites and services. This Privacy Policy Statement divulges what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct, change, or remove it. The Services made available through AuntMinnie may be provided in a variety of media and devices now known or hereinafter developed including mobile applications, and include without limitation online market research surveys, communities and forums, reference tools, and applications, sponsored programs, personalized scientific or medical content, medical education, job boards, communication tools, and discussion boards.
<br><br>
<b>I. YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use apply each time you access the Sites or use the Services. When you access the Sites or use the Services, you accept this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use as if you had signed them, and you consent to our collecting and using your information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, you may not access the Sites or use the Services.
<br><br>
We may revise or terminate these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy at any time, without notice to you. You are responsible for reviewing these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy regularly. Your access of the Sites or use of any of the Services following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use or our Privacy Policy means you agree to abide by those changes. Any questions regarding our Privacy Policy or Terms of Use should be directed to AuntMinnie at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@auntminnie.com">privacypolicy@auntminnie.com</a>. 
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy was last revised on March 27th, 2018.</b>
<br><br>
<b>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA OUR SITES</b>
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect from Unregistered Visitors</b>
<br><br>
You must register to access our full Services; however, you may be able to access certain limited areas of the Sites without disclosing any personally identifiable information. We will collect non-personally identifiable information, i.e., information that is not traced back to any individual and is not used on its own to identify an individual.
<br><br>
Even if you have not registered, AuntMinnie will collect such data including: the referring website, if applicable, the type of browser you use, the time and date that you accessed the Services, the pages you visited and viewed throughout our Sites, and what computers responded to a market research survey.
<br><br>
Taken in aggregate, this information enables us to better develop and fund the Services, provide content, and respond to our users’ needs. We will explain how this is done in the "Information Collected through Tracking Technology" section of this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect from Registered Users</b>
<br><br>
<b><i>Account Registration:</i></b> You must register to access our full Services. When you register for the Services, you are asked to provide identifying information such as your name, email address, zip code and other professional information, e.g. profession and science application. Additional information may be requested, which may be required to access some Services. We may collect additional information about registered users from third-party sources to assist us in providing the Services. For example, we may use such third-party sources to verify and update registration information and confirm licensure status.
<br><br>
<b>Information We Collect through Services We Offer</b>
<br><br>
<b><i>Market Research:</i></b> Registered users of the Services may opt-in to receive offers to participate in market research studies offered by AuntMinnie. From time to time, registered users may also be invited to participate in a sponsored or unsponsored market research study through an email invitation, mail, on-site popup or some other means. In order to participate in any such survey, you will be required to agree to additional terms and conditions as part of the opt-in process.
<br><br>
Furthermore, in addition to providing your responses to the survey questions you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may be combined with information that you have already provided at registration or that we have received from a third-party source. These studies are intended to give specific anonymous feedback to third parties as described in the "IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT" section of this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b><i>Reporting Compensation and Tax Information:</i></b> If you participate in a survey that pays compensation, AuntMinnie may have an obligation to report such payments. By participating in a market research survey, you are permitting us to disclose your earned compensation as appropriate to comply with all laws and other reporting requirements. In addition, IRS regulations prevent us from paying individuals in excess of $600 in any given tax year without valid tax information. If tax information is not provided within 12 months after completing a survey, compensation above $600 in any tax year is forfeited.
<br><br>
<b><i>Additional Forms and Emails:</i></b> We may also ask you to provide additional information after you register if you want to obtain additional services or information such as continuing education or continuing medical education, or to resolve complaints or concerns.
<br><br>
<b>III. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</b>
<br><br>
AuntMinnie collects information about your activity on the Sites using technologies such as cookies, including third-party cookies, web beacons and server log files.
<br><br>
<b>Usage Tracking</b>
<br>
AuntMinnie uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout the Services. AuntMinnie uses this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested. Additionally, solely in connection with your voluntary participation in a market research study or screening or medical education, your computer may (i) be tracked by digital fingerprinting or watermarking to help ensure unique responders to a survey, and (ii) accessed to assess browser compatibility and/or video cam utility.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
A cookie is a small text file placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. A cookie can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to us that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on a Site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user’s browser (e.g., domain name, browser type). Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
<br><br>
AuntMinnie uses cookies to monitor and manage Service development and delivery, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the Service based on your preferences and specifications. We may assign cookies to devices that access our Services to help us dynamically generate content to users of the Services.
<br><br>
<b>Web Beacons</b>
<br>
AuntMinnie and our third-party business partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
<br><br>
We and our third-party business partners use the information automatically generated by cookies and web beacons, as well as other information that we or they have, to provide you with an optimal website experience.
<br><br>
At this time, the Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "do not track" instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. If your browser is set to block cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you about your options for managing your cookies.
<br><br>
<b>IV. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
<br><br>
We retain and use the information we collect about you as follows:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>To provide our Services to you, to communicate with you about your use of our Services, to respond to your inquiries, and for other customer services purposes.
<br>
</li><li>To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experience while using the Site or Services.
<br>
</li><li>To understand how users access and use our Site and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Site and the Services and respond to desires and preferences.
<br>
</li><li>To personalize content.
<br>
</li><li>As necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements (including this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use), to protect or defend our rights, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
<br>
</li><li>We may also use aggregate or de-identified information about users for other marketing, research and other purposes as further described in the "INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURES" section of this Privacy Policy.</li></ul>
<br><br>
<b>V. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURES</b>
<br><br>
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, we will not disclose to any third party personally identifiable information we gather from you through the Sites.
<br><br>
<b>"No-Spam" Policy</b>
<br>
Your email address will not be sold to a third party. You may opt out or unsubscribe at any time.
<br><br>
<b>Aggregate Data</b>
<br>
We aggregate data from registered and unregistered users for use in Service funding, analysis, development and delivery. Aggregate usage information provided to third parties or used to deliver services to third parties allows us to keep our services free to users. Aggregated information is pooled from many individual records and stripped of any data that could be used to identify an individual. Information collected in the registration process is never shared with third parties in a personally identifiable way, except as identified in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>Third Parties</b>
<br>
In addition to aggregate information, we may share some kinds of personally identifiable information with third parties as described below.
<br><br>
<b><i>Continuing Education, Continuing Medical Education and Market Research Studies:</i></b> From time to time, we may invite you via e-mail to participate in sponsored or unsponsored medical education or market research studies. When you agree to participate in a these programs, you agree to share with AuntMinnie personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, zip code and professional information. Generally, these programs provide specific feedback using aggregated, de-identified data to third parties used to analyze trends and statistics for research and development purposes, and neither your identity nor your specific feedback is shared with third parties. However, under the following circumstances, your identity may be shared with third parties and/or associated with specific feedback: (i) when you participate in a medical education program or we have your consent, (ii) when we match user information with such third party’s data, (iii) when we suspect your answers are fraudulently provided and (iv) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. In all circumstances, the privacy of our members is protected, and if such sharing is permitted or required, your answers and identity will remain confidential. Please review the "IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT" section of this Privacy Policy for additional information.
<br><br>
In participating with our market research studies, you have the option to provide us with information that you report about yourself through our surveys ("Self-Reported Information"). For example, you may provide us with information about your ethnicity, conditions, other health-related information related to the objective of the study.
<br><br>
<i><b>Affiliated Companies:</b></i> BioInformatics Inc and its affiliates including AuntMinnie.com, DrBicuspid.com, IBO, IMV, SDi, and the Science Advisory Board are part of the Science and Medicine Group of companies that provide Internet services for scientists, healthcare professionals, physicians and other specialists around the world (collectively, "Affiliates"). AuntMinnie may share your personal information with Affiliates, which may use your personal information to send you emails about services they provide, new programs and selected information from their sponsors as it relates to your specialty or area of practice.<br><br>
