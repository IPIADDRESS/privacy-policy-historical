					<h3>Information Relating to Children</h3>
					<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>. The Aurigma Website and any products or services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase products and services, or download software programs. The collection of information is covered above. Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child.

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Aurigma takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.</p>
					<p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company’s security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches Aurigma it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Aurigma. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where Aurigma and its service providers conduct business. All Aurigma employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p>
					<h2>C.&nbsp;Use And Disclosure of Information</h2>
					<h3>How your personal information is used</h3>
					<p>Aurigma collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and other products and services of Aurigma and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.</p>
					<p>Aurigma may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Aurigma may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>
					<p>Aurigma recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, Aurigma will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Aurigma or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Aurigma will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
					<p>However, you should be aware that some of your contact information in advertisements and postings may be visible for all other visitors, and we cannot guarantee that someone will not use it for commercial or other purposes or activities.</p>
					<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
					<p>Aurigma may use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Aurigma. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose Aurigma specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Aurigma’s affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>
					<p>Aurigma may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Aurigma may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.</p>
					<p>In the event that all or substantially all of Aurigma’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Aurigma may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.</p>
					<h3>Choices available to you</h3>
					<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Aurigma Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such services.</p>
					<p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Aurigma or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to “opt out” we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.</p>
					<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.</p>
					<p>Aurigma is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.</p>
					<p>When you create a personal account with Aurigma and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to Aurigma offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom Aurigma has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you.
