Use of Cookies </strong><br>Some of our services require the use of cookies. We use cookies to optimise and customise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is either temporarily stored in computer memory ("session cookies") or saved on the hard drive ("persistent cookie"). Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The main purpose of cookies is to track your preferences and make the use of our service as simple as possible for you. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, you can change your browser preferences to refuse cookies if desired. If you reject cookies, not all our services are guaranteed to work smoothly for you.<br><br>We use mostly session cookies that are not stored on your hard disk and are deleted when you exit your browser. Session cookies are used primarily for login authentication and load balancing. We also use cookies to track access to Aupairnet24.com from external advertising spaces (ZANOX AG, Netslaves GmbH, Affilinet GmbH, Belboon GmbH). These cookies do not contain personal information about you and and are generally deleted after you log into Aupairnet24.com.co.uk - otherwise, they are automatically deleted after no more than 180 days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">We also use cookies from our partners to track advertisements. These unique cookies are set to track information such as how often an ad has been viewed and this information is forwarded to advertisers. The information sent is anonymised and contains no personal data.Aupairnet24 uses different marketing strategies to inform the users
about our services. In this regard we
use, inter alia, search engine
marketing campaigns, affiliate campaigns and remarketing campaigns. In order to control and optimize
the performance of these campaigns cookies and other tracking technologies are
used. In particular, remarketing enables the interest based
advertising at partner networks for the users who have already demonstrated their
interest in our services. The advertising materials are displayed on the basis
of cookie-based analysis of users'
behavior.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>We use "permanent cookies" to track click streams and to automatically determine whether you have, for example, already voted in a poll, responded to an advertising campaign or viewed a message so that we can avoid unneccessarily repeating information you see.<br><br>The Aupairnet24.com site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer to help analyze the use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site is sent to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other website activity and internet related services. In addition, Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required to do so by law or if third parties process the information on Google's behalf.
