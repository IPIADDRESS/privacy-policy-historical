<p>Auctionata, Inc. (“Auctionata”) is committed to letting you know how we will collect and use your personally identifiable information. The policies below are applicable to Auctionata’s network of websites, including <a href="/en-us/">www.auctionata.com</a> and <a href="https://magazine.auctionata.com">magazine.auctionata.com</a>, all email newsletters published or distributed by Auctionata, the Auctionata mobile application, and all other interactive features, services, and communications provided by Auctionata (the ”Sites”), however accessed and/or used, that are operated by us, made available by us, or produced and maintained by Auctionata (collectively “Auctionata” or “we”, “us”, or “our”). We have established this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let you know the kinds of personally identifiable information we may gather during your visit to these Sites, why we gather your information, what we use your personally identifiable information for, when we might disclose your personally identifiable information, and how you can manage your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.</p>

<p><strong>By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this Privacy Policy retroactively or to personally identifiable information already in our possession, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments and seek your consent for such use.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or do not see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at <a href="mailto:usinfo@auctionata.com">usinfo@auctionata.com</a> with “PRIVACY POLICY” in the subject line.</p>

                    <strong>1. Information collected about you</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites: personally identifiable information (“PII”) and non-personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information is information that you may supply to us, as described more fully below (e.g., when registering for an account on a Site). Personally identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, among other things, your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card, billing and contact information, driver’s license number, social security number, bank account number, and photographic image. Non-personally identifiable information includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, and use of the Sites and the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>  A. Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p><span>As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personally identifiable information to us.  However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personally identifiable information.  The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personally identifiable information:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Registration for an account on the Sites.
</li><li>Request for customer service or other assistance.
</li><li>Sign up to receive e-mail newsletters or e-mail alerts from us.
</li><li>Sign up to receive e-mail offers from Auctionata or Auctionata partners.
</li><li>Participation in surveys, panels, or market research.
</li><li>Participation in special events and promotions.
</li><li>Submission of items for valuation and sale on the Sites.
</li><li>Purchases on the Sites, including subscriptions to Auctionata services.
</li><li>Submission of a job application.
</li><li>Entry in contests or sweepstakes.
</li><li>Participation on social media accounts involving Auctionata, our Sites and our brands.
</li><li>Participation in communities, chat rooms and comment threads, other fora, and other interactive services.
</li><li>Submission of user generated content on any part of the Sites that permit it.
</li><li>Any other place on the Sites where you knowingly volunteer personally identifiable information.​​
</li></ul>

<p><strong>  B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p><span>In addition, when you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Sites (“non-personally identifiable information” or “non-PII”). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of non-personally identifiable information:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Demographic data such as age, gender, and five digit zip code as part of collecting personally identifiable information.
</li><li>Neighborhood information.
</li><li>Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites.  This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.
</li><li>Usage information about your use of the Sites.  This information includes a reading history of the pages you view.  We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Sites.
</li><li>Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.
</li><li>Your search terms and search results.
</li><li>Other information regarding your use of the Sites.
</li><li>Aggregate data regarding the use of the Sites.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>  C.  Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information</strong></p>

<p><span>We collect and store your device’s source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Sites.  Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.</span></p>

<p><span>In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature.  If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content tied to your location.</span></p>

<p><strong>  D.  Collection of Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information From Other Sources</strong></p>

<p><span>We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources (including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us to verify, update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Sites.  We may also collect PII from credit reporting agencies to, for example, determine your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage.</span></p>

                    <strong>2. Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>To enhance your experience on our Sites and to facilitate the use of certain functions, we use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>We may also use web beacons or flash cookies. A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as “action tags”, “tracer tags”, or “single-pixel gifs”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission.</p>

<p>We may partner with third party advertising companies who may utilize flash or enhanced cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information from us, without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites. Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.</p>

<p>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Auctionata’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>

                    <strong>3. Children’s information</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sites are not intended for children under 13 years of age.  Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and with parent or guardian consent, Auctionata does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not provide personally identifiable information to Auctionata without providing us with consent from your parents. If Auctionata discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Auctionata with personally identifiable information and we do not have parental consent, Auctionata will immediately delete that child’s information from the Sites. If you believe that Auctionata has been provided with the personally identifiable information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:usinfo@auctionata.com">usinfo@auctionata.com</a>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your personally identifiable information collected online to any organizations not part of Auctionata or its subsidiaries or related entities, except as described below.  Although, as disclosed below, we may provide your information to our agents, affiliates, and partners, in no event will we sell or rent your personally identifiable information as part of a customer list or similar transaction.</p>

<p><strong>A. Third-Party Agents</strong></p>

<p><span>We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, social media integration, marketing, analytics, and fraud protection.  These entities may have access to personally identifiable information if needed to perform their functions.  If such access is required, the third parties will be contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that personally identifiable information.  They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites.</span></p>

<p><strong>B.  Information collected through social media sites</strong></p>

<p><span>When you interact with any Auctionata property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personally identifiable information that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID or “handle.” However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform, and we will only collect and store such personally identifiable information that we are permitted to collect by these social media platforms.  If you choose to link or login to your Auctionata account with or through a social networking service, Auctionata and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you view on the Sites. with that social network’s users.</span></p>

Although our treatment of your personally identifiable information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the business partner or third party’s treatment of your personally identifiable information will be governed by the business partner or third party’s privacy policy.  You may withdraw your consent to our sharing of your personally identifiable information with business partners and third parties at any time by following the opt-out process described below.</span></p>

<p><strong>D. Assignment</strong></p>

<p><span>We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites.  We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites.  As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to an entity acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged.  Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p><strong>E.  Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations</strong></p>

                  <p>We are concerned about ensuring the security of your personally identifiable information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers. Personally identifiable information collected by the Sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your personally identifiable information to you.
