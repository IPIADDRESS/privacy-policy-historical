    <br>
    <b>1) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The information we gather on our site falls into two
    categories: (1) tracking information collected as you
    navigate through our site, and (2) personal information you
    supply when you register or subscribe:<br>
    <br>
    <u>Tracking Information</u><br>
    <br>
    Tracking information is collected and stored whenever a
    request is made for any page or image on our servers. This
    information can be analyzed and presented in the aggregate or
    organized by user sessions. We use it for analysis and
    reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know
    how long the average user spends on our site, or which pages
    or features get the most attention.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
    <br>
    To use certain features on our site, we ask you to register
    and subscribe. When you register, we collect personally
    identifiable information about you such as your name, mailing
    address, e-mail address, telephone number, user name,
    password, and other information about your interest in our
    site and services. In addition, when you subscribe, we
    collect credit card details necessary for our billing
    process.<br>
    <br>
    At present, personally identifiable information about users
    is collected only through site pages or forms submitted by
    users themselves. When personally identifiable information is
    collected, you will know because you will have to fill out
    one of these forms.<br>
    <br>
    <u>A Note on Cookies</u><br>
    <br>
    A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your
    browser from a web server and is sometimes stored on your
    computer's hard drive, although not always. Our cookies
    contain unique numbers that allow our site to recognize your
    computer as you move about our site during a session or
    period of use. As an example benefit of cookies, you only
    need to sign-in once at the start of a session; after that,
    we recognize you as a subscriber. We do not use cookies to
    store any information beyond a session identifier.<br>
    <br>
    The help function on most browsers contains information on
    how to set your browser to notify you before accepting
    cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't
    accept cookies, you won't be able to use any feature that
    requires registration or subscription.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    AuctionZip uses personally identifiable information in a
    limited number of ways, in general falling into the following
    categories:<br>
    <br>
    <u>Usage Tracking for Business Development and
    Management</u><br>
    <br>
    Our primary business is conducted entirely online.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such,
    our success will depend on our ability to gauge popularity of
    one feature or product offering over another, or on our
    ability to understand how people use our products. Tracking
    and aggregating usage information will allow us to develop
    this understanding.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Our Communications Features</u><br>
    <br>
    Our site offers registered users the ability to forward along
    objects of interest to others, and in some cases to
    communicate with an auction house concerning an object
    offered in an upcoming auction.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to facilitate this
    communication, a registered user's email of record must be
    accessed.<br>
    <br>
    As a service to auction houses, we keep track of
    communications between registered users and auction houses.
    Not all auction houses permit direct communication with our
    users.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may store destination emails sent by users to
    auction houses with questions or request for more information
    about an object.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an auction house requests more
    information about a user, we may share that information if we
    determine that is in our interest to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may disable
    your capability to communicate with a specific auction
    house.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also revoke your auction house communication
    privileges at any time without notifying you if we determine
    that it is in our interest to do so.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Subscription Billing</u><br>
    <br>
    We charge fees for using our subscription level services. At
    present, these are AuctionZip Basic, AuctionZip Premium, and
    AuctionZip Professional subscriptions. To enable the purchase
    of these products, AuctionZip collects and stores billing and
    credit card information. This information will be shared only
    with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the
    purchase transaction. Examples of such tasks include
    processing credit card payments for new subscriptions,
    subscription renewals and subscription upgrades. Please see
    Protection of Your Information for other relevant
    information.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Access Control</u><br>
    <br>
    In order to access paid subscription products, you will be
    required to enter a user name and password through our secure
    sign-in on each visit. At that time, the current status of
    your subscription will be checked, and appropriate access
    given according to the information on file.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Communications with Our Customers and Customer
    Support</u><br>
    <br>
    From time to time, it may be necessary to notify subscribers
    of impending subscription expirations, account or credit card
    issues, transactions completed, and in the case of registered
    users terms agreement or policy changes. While such
    communication will typically be conducted through email, as
    appropriate, mail or phone may also be used.<br>
    <br>
    While we do not presently, in the future we may use the
    information you provide to send you e-mail and mail only for
    products offered by AuctionZip or its affiliates, or to
    determine your interest in programs or services that we
    believe may be of interest to you. These materials will be
    offered on an opt-in basis only.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Compliance with Legal Process</u><br>
    <br>
    We may disclose personal information if we are required to do
    so by law, or in good faith believe that such action is
    necessary to: 1) comply with the law or with legal process;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    2) protect and defend our rights and property; 3) protect
    against misuse or unauthorized use of AuctionZip.com data; or
    4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or
    the public (among other things, this means that if you
    provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else,
    information about you may be disclosed as part of any
    investigation into your actions).<br>
    <br>
    <u>Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
    <br>
    In some instances, we use third party companies to help us
    provide our products and services to you, like a shipping
    company that delivers a package or an e-mail delivery service
    that sends out our e-mails or e-newsletters. In those
    instances we need to share your information with them. We
    require that those companies use the information only to
    deliver our product or service.<br>
    <br>
    AuctionZip will share some or all of your personal
    information with another business entity should we plan to
    merge with or be acquired by that business entity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
    event that such a combination occurs, we will require that
    the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with
    respect to your personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your personal
    information will be used contrary to this policy, you will
    receive prior notice in as provided in Section 2 above.<br>
    <br>
    If it is clear from the information that you provide us that
    you are a member of the antiques, art, auction or related
    trades we may, in our sole discretion list you in
    directories, or other areas of our site, and may use the name
    of your firm and your relationship to us in marketing or
    advertising on our site, or in our promotional materials,
    paid advertising, or other media in order to promote our
    services. We will not display the content of your email
    submissions about our services as testimonials for
    promotional purposes without your express permission.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>3) HOW YOU CAN CORRECT INFORMATION</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Except for tracking and aggregated information, or as
    outlined in the section 5) below on Security and Protection
    of Your Information, all your information is available to you
    for review and update through your AuctionZip Home and
    AuctionZip User Home page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>4) OUR E-MAIL POLICIES</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>Account and Services Related E-mail</u><br>
    <br>
    We will send you e-mails relating to your account. These
    include order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, and
    credit card problem notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    If you send auction houses emails with a question, or
    requesting more information about an object, the auction
    house may respond by email at your registered email
    address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if you send emails to others to forward
    objects on AuctionZip, the recipients of those emails may
    respond by email to your registered email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    If we offer, and you have registered for upcoming auction
    alerts or online discussions, you may receive emails specific
    to your participation online.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Email Newsletters</u><br>
    <br>
    We may offer e-mail newsletters.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not wish to
    receive newsletters, you can follow the 'unsubscribe'
    instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Promotional E-mails</u><br>
    <br>
    We may e-mail you messages that we think may be of interest
    to you about other products and services. You can choose not
    to receive additional future messages by following the
    'unsubscribe' instructions located near the bottom of each
    e-mail."<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>5) SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We take very seriously our commitment to protect your
    personal information. To this end, we maintain a secure
    process to collect, transmit and store your personally
    identifiable information including credit card details.<br>
    <br>
    Subscribers can review or change their registration, or
    subscription information at any time through the AuctionZip

    number and card verification number which cannot be viewed or

    <br>
    We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to
    divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account
    and close your browser window when you have finished your

    especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or
    using a computer in a public place.<br>
    <br>
    As a dynamic and growing Site, AuctionZip may contain links
    to other sites that are not under our control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those Web
