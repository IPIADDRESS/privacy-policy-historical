		<h2>AUCTIONZIP PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
		
		<p>
			AuctionZip, LLC ("AuctionZip") is a Delaware Limited

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Our policies have been developed with the recognition that
			Internet technologies and underlying business models are
			rapidly evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, our policies are subject to
			change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If the
			changes represent a material departure from our current
			practices with respect to the use of personal information,
			the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to
			taking effect, and registered users will be notified as

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			As a condition of using AuctionZip.com, users must confirm
			their adult status.&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the Children's
			Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), AuctionZip.com does
			not collect or store any personal information, even in

		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you
			understand our online privacy practices regarding:<br>
		</p>
			<div style="margin: 20px 2em; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">
			  1) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT<br>
			  <br>
			  2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED<br>
			  <br>
			  3) HOW YOU CAN CORRECT INFORMATION<br>
			  <br>
			  4) OUR E-MAIL POLICIES<br>
			  <br>
			  5) SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION<br>
			  <br>
			  6) HOW TO CONTACT US
			</div>
		
		<h2>
			<b>1) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The information we gather on our site falls into two
			categories: (1) tracking information collected as you
			navigate through our site, and (2) personal information you
			supply when you register or subscribe:
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<u>Tracking Information</u>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Tracking information is collected and stored whenever a
			request is made for any page or image on our servers. This
			information can be analyzed and presented in the aggregate or
			organized by user sessions. We use it for analysis and
			reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know
			how long the average user spends on our site, or which pages
			or features get the most attention.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
			<br>
			To use certain features on our site, we ask you to register
			and subscribe. When you register, we collect personally
			identifiable information about you such as your name, mailing
			address, e-mail address, telephone number, user name,
			password, and other information about your interest in our
			site and services. In addition, when you subscribe, we
			collect credit card details necessary for our billing
			process.<br>
			<br>
			At present, personally identifiable information about users
			is collected only through site pages or forms submitted by
			users themselves. When personally identifiable information is
			collected, you will know because you will have to fill out
			one of these forms.<br>
			<br>
			<u>A Note on Cookies</u><br>
			<br>
			A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your
			browser from a web server and is sometimes stored on your
			computer's hard drive, although not always. Our cookies
			contain unique numbers that allow our site to recognize your
			computer as you move about our site during a session or
			period of use. As an example benefit of cookies, you only
			need to sign-in once at the start of a session; after that,
			we recognize you as a subscriber. We do not use cookies to
			store any information beyond a session identifier.<br>
			<br>
			The help function on most browsers contains information on
			how to set your browser to notify you before accepting
			cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't
			accept cookies, you won't be able to use any feature that
			requires registration or subscription.<br>
		</p>
		
			<h2><strong>2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED</strong></h2>
		<p>
			AuctionZip uses personally identifiable information in a
			limited number of ways, in general falling into the following
			categories:<br>
			<br>
			<u>Usage Tracking for Business Development and
			Management</u><br>
			<br>
			Our primary business is conducted entirely online.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such,
			our success will depend on our ability to gauge popularity of
			one feature or product offering over another, or on our
			ability to understand how people use our products. Tracking
			and aggregating usage information will allow us to develop
			this understanding.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Our Communications Features</u><br>
			<br>
			Our site offers registered users the ability to forward along
			objects of interest to others, and in some cases to
			communicate with an auction house concerning an object
			offered in an upcoming auction.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to facilitate this
			communication, a registered user's email of record must be
			accessed.<br>
			<br>
			As a service to auction houses, we keep track of
			communications between registered users and auction houses.
			Not all auction houses permit direct communication with our
			users.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may store destination emails sent by users to
			auction houses with questions or request for more information
			about an object.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an auction house requests more
			information about a user, we may share that information if we
			determine that is in our interest to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may disable
			your capability to communicate with a specific auction
			house.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also revoke your auction house communication
			privileges at any time without notifying you if we determine
			that it is in our interest to do so.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Subscription Billing</u><br>
			<br>
			We charge fees for using our subscription level services. At
			present, these are AuctionZip Basic, AuctionZip Premium, and
			AuctionZip Professional subscriptions. To enable the purchase
			of these products, AuctionZip collects and stores billing and
			credit card information. This information will be shared only
			with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the
			purchase transaction. Examples of such tasks include
			processing credit card payments for new subscriptions,
			subscription renewals and subscription upgrades. Please see
			Protection of Your Information for other relevant
			information.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Access Control</u><br>
			<br>
			In order to access paid subscription products, you will be
			required to enter a user name and password through our secure
			sign-in on each visit. At that time, the current status of
			your subscription will be checked, and appropriate access
			given according to the information on file.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Communications with Our Customers and Customer
			Support</u><br>
			<br>
			From time to time, it may be necessary to notify subscribers
			of impending subscription expirations, account or credit card
			issues, transactions completed, and in the case of registered
			users terms agreement or policy changes. While such
			communication will typically be conducted through email, as
			appropriate, mail or phone may also be used.<br>
			<br>
			While we do not presently, in the future we may use the
			information you provide to send you e-mail and mail only for
			products offered by AuctionZip or its affiliates, or to
			determine your interest in programs or services that we
			believe may be of interest to you. These materials will be
			offered on an opt-in basis only.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Compliance with Legal Process</u><br>
			<br>
			We may disclose personal information if we are required to do
			so by law, or in good faith believe that such action is
			necessary to: 1) comply with the law or with legal process;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			2) protect and defend our rights and property; 3) protect
			against misuse or unauthorized use of AuctionZip.com data; or
			4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or
			the public (among other things, this means that if you
			provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else,
			information about you may be disclosed as part of any
			investigation into your actions).<br>
			<br>
			<u>Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information</u><br>
			<br>
			In some instances, we use third party companies to help us
			provide our products and services to you, like a shipping
			company that delivers a package or an e-mail delivery service
			that sends out our e-mails or e-newsletters. In those
			instances we need to share your information with them. We
			require that those companies use the information only to
			deliver our product or service.<br>
			<br>
			AuctionZip will share some or all of your personal
			information with another business entity should we plan to
			merge with or be acquired by that business entity.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
			event that such a combination occurs, we will require that
			the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with
			respect to your personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your personal
			information will be used contrary to this policy, you will
			receive prior notice in as provided in Section 2 above.<br>
			<br>
			If it is clear from the information that you provide us that
			you are a member of the antiques, art, auction or related
			trades we may, in our sole discretion list you in
			directories, or other areas of our site, and may use the name
			of your firm and your relationship to us in marketing or
			advertising on our site, or in our promotional materials,
			paid advertising, or other media in order to promote our
			services. We will not display the content of your email
			submissions about our services as testimonials for
			promotional purposes without your express permission.<br>
		</p>
		
			<h2><strong>3) HOW YOU CAN CORRECT INFORMATION</strong></h2>
		<p>
			Except for tracking and aggregated information, or as
			outlined in the section 5) below on Security and Protection
			of Your Information, all your information is available to you
			for review and update through your AuctionZip Home and
			AuctionZip User Home page.
		</p>
		
			<h2><strong>4) OUR E-MAIL POLICIES</strong></h2>
		<p>
			<u>Account and Services Related E-mail</u><br>
			<br>
			We will send you e-mails relating to your account. These
			include order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, and
			credit card problem notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			If you send auction houses emails with a question, or
			requesting more information about an object, the auction
			house may respond by email at your registered email
			address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, if you send emails to others to forward
			objects on AuctionZip, the recipients of those emails may
			respond by email to your registered email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			If we offer, and you have registered for upcoming auction
			alerts or online discussions, you may receive emails specific
			to your participation online.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Email Newsletters</u><br>
			<br>
			We may offer e-mail newsletters.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not wish to
			receive newsletters, you can follow the 'unsubscribe'
			instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.<br>
			<br>
			<u>Promotional E-mails</u><br>
			<br>
			We may e-mail you messages that we think may be of interest
			to you about other products and services. You can choose not
			to receive additional future messages by following the
			'unsubscribe' instructions located near the bottom of each
			e-mail."
		</p>
		
			<h2><strong>5) SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h2>
		<p>
			We take very seriously our commitment to protect your
			personal information. To this end, we maintain a secure
			process to collect, transmit and store your personally
			identifiable information including credit card details.<br>
			<br>
			Subscribers can review or change their registration, or
			subscription information at any time through the AuctionZip
			Home or AuctionZip User Home page with the exception of card
			number and card verification number which cannot be viewed or
			changed by any means.<br>
			<br>
			We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to
			divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account
			and close your browser window when you have finished your
			visit. This ensures that others cannot access your account,
			especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or
			using a computer in a public place.<br>
			<br>
			As a dynamic and growing Site, AuctionZip may contain links
			to other sites that are not under our control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those Web
			sites have their own policies regarding privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; For your
			own protection, you should review their policies upon
			visiting these other sites to make sure they meet your
			expectations of privacy.
		</p>
