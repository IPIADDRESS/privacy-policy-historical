  </b><li><b><a name="1"></a>A Special Note About Children.</b><br>
  Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under
  the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a
  minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with your parents or
  guardians.
  <p><b></b></p><b>
  </b></li><li><b><a name="2"></a>Information We Collect.</b><br>
  Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a
  smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide
  services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our
  service to make your experience easier.
  <p>In general, you can browse our site without telling us who you are or
  revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your
  personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our
  services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information,
  billing information, shipping information and other personal information as
  indicated on the forms throughout our site. Where possible, we indicate which
  fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option
  to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or
  feature.
  </p><p>Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial
  information, such as, but not limited to: if you are registering using an
  email account at a free email service, or registering to sell on our site. We
  use your financial information, including credit card information to verify
  your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use
  of our services.
  </p><p>We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our
  site. We use this information to do internal research on our users'
  demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and
  our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from
  (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether
  this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP
  address.
  </p><p>We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages
  of our site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional
  effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small
  files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized
  services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of
  a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password
  less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information
  that is targeted to your interests. (For more information about why we use
  cookies.) Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are
  automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are
  always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that
  case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be
  required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.
  </p><p>Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar
  devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties. For
  example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a
  "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of
  cookies by third parties.
  </p><p>If you choose to bid, buy or sell on our site, we collect information about
  your bidding, buying and selling behavior. We also collect other users'
  comments about you in our feedback area.
  </p><p>If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we
  collect some additional information, including a billing address, a credit
  card number and a credit card expiration date and tracking information from
  checks or money orders.</p>
