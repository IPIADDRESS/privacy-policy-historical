When it is necessary to transfer your personal data outside the US, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect thte privacy and integrity of such personal data. Please Contact Us if you wish to obtain information concerning such safeguards.</p>
<p><strong>7.	HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR?</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we will only retain your information for as long as we need it to achieve the purpose(s) for which we obtained it in the first place, as required by law, and for the exercise or defence of legal claims. We will then either securely delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you (see paragraph 2 for full details of those purposes). </p>
<p><strong>8.	MANAGING  YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>It is very important to us that all the information we hold about you remains accurate and up to date to reduce the risk of a misunderstanding. We need your help in doing so. If you have an online account with us, please ensure that the information (for example, contact information) you provide to us through that account remains accurate and up to date. Please review and update it regularly.</p>
<p>You have several rights in relation to your personal data under applicable privacy and data protection law, which may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions.

We reserve the right to charge you a small administration fee to meet our costs in honouring your legal rights, where permitted by the relevant law.  We reserve the right not to comply with any requests we receive where we may lawfully do so, for example if we reasonably believe a request to be malicious, technically very onerous, to involve disproportionate effort or harmful to the rights of others.</p>
