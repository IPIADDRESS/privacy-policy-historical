<div class="text parbase section"><div class="longTxt"><p>Our mission at the University of Auckland (“the University”) is to be a “<i>research-led, international university, recognised for excellence in teaching, learning, research, creative work, and administration, for the significance of its contributions to the advancement of knowledge and its commitment to serve its local, national and international communities</i>”.</p>
<p>We can’t achieve our mission without collecting and processing personal information about our prospective, current and former students, and about our donors and friends. We know that our people will only relinquish control of their personal information if they trust us to use it responsibly and treat it with care and respect. This privacy statement explains what information we collect about the people we deal with and how we process it.</p>
<p>If you are an employee of the University, read more about how we use your personal information in <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/admin/footer-links/privacy/employee-privacy.html">Employee Privacy</a>.</p>
<p>People from all over the world come to New Zealand to work, research or learn with us, and so we collect and process personal information about people from many countries. For this reason, we have developed a privacy regime that recognises the fundamental privacy concepts that underpin all privacy regimes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li><b>Data minimisation</b> – we will collect and retain only the personal information we really need to meet our lawful purposes<br>
</li>
<li><b>Transparency</b> – we will always be open with people about the personal information we collect and how we process it<br>
</li>
<li><b>Security</b> – we take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected against loss or unauthorised processing<br>
</li>
<li><b>Use limitation</b> – we use and share personal information only in the ways we say we will, and only where necessary to meet our lawful purposes<br>
</li>
<li><b>Rights focused</b> – we will make sure that people can exercise their important privacy rights, including to access and correct their information</li>
</ul>
<p>This privacy statement is about the practices of the University. We are the <b>data controller</b>, which means that we determine the purposes for, and ways in which, we collect and use personal information. We also use third party data processors.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Our lawful bases for collecting and processing personal information in these ways are to meet our <b>obligations to students</b> as their tertiary education provider and to meet our <b>legitimate interests</b>, including making sure our services are fit-for-purpose and are delivered in a way that meets New Zealand’s educational standards and keeps our students and staff safe.</p>
<h3>The information we collect about students</h3>
<p>We may collect personal information when you provide it to us directly – for example during the pre-application, application and enrolment processes – from third parties (usually with your consent) – for example where we need to verify previous study at other institutions – or when you generate personal information by using our services – for example when you check out a book from the General Library.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide any of the personal information requested, it may not be possible for the University to consider you for admission, enrol you, or properly deliver the services you have requested from us.</p>
<p>The personal information we collect about you as a student will include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>Biographical details (including name, former name, alias, gender and date of birth)</li>
<li>Contact details (including address, telephone, email, and emergency and alternative contact details)</li>
<li>Education record and academic/research history</li>
<li>Citizenship or residency information</li>

<li>Passport and visa details</li>
<li>Information about your English language proficiency</li>
<li>Health and disability information (including where you use student health, counselling, disability, accommodation, or recreation services, or where you have applied for a field trip, student exchange or study abroad programme)</li>
<li>Career information (including your aspirations and relevant work history/experience)</li>

<li>Information about your child provided by you to our Early Childhood Centres (if you have enrolled your child in one of these Centres)</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect personal information about you as you use our services and participate in campus life. For example, we may audio and/or video record the lectures you attend (your lecturer will usually advise you of this beforehand). Where CCTV cameras are in use at a University campus, we may collect still or video footage of your activities for safety and security purposes. We also use sensors on many University desks to assist us to operate sustainably (the sensors tell us if a desk is occupied, so we can allocate resources efficiently and manage lighting and heating requirements), however the data collected from these sensors will not identify you unless you are using an assigned desk.</p>
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>In order to meet the primary purposes set out above, we will use your personal information in the ways set out below. We will generally only use personal information in these ways. Where we need to use information in a way we have not anticipated here, we will only do so if required or permitted by law.</p>

</ul>

We may also use automated tools to assist us with the marking of multiple choice assessments. In most cases where we use automated processing as part of our admissions or course administration processes, the outcomes are reviewed by our employees.</p>
