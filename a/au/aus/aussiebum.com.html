				We collect the following information:
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					Content:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Account and Profile Information:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					We collect information about you and your company as you register for an aussieBum account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with aussieBum Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). Information we collect includes but is not limited to your name, username, address, email address, phone number, profile photo, job title, or credit card details.

				</dd>
				<dt>
					Other submissions:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					  We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the aussieBum Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us.

				Information we collect from your use of aussieBum Services
			</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>
					Web Logs:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve aussieBum Services for individual customers.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Analytics Information from Website:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					We and our analytics provider collect and store analytics information when you use our Websites and Services to help us improve our products and services.<br>
					The analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an aussieBum Service. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an analytics provider. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to Google's Policies and Principles. Use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent to analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Analytics Information Derived from Content:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of products and promotional assets that users are most interested in.<br>
					Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:
				</dt>
				<dd>
					We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies that we save to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use cookies to improve and customize aussieBum Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and Services are most popular. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Websites or Services. We also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Websites or in emails that help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.

					Information from third party services:
