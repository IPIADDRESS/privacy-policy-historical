<p>Last updated: 31 July 2003</p>
<p>AustLII's privacy policies are based on respect for international standards
of information privacy protection and are in accordance with Australian
privacy laws including the New South Wales <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/papipa1998464/">Privacy
and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 </a>insofar as it is applicable
to AustLII.
</p><p>AustLII is a joint facility of the University of Technology, Sydney
and the University of New South Wales. Information about individuals provided to
AustLII staff in that capacity is provided to both Universities. The general
web site privacy policies of our Universities may be found in the <a href="http://www.uts.edu.au/privacy.html">UTS
Privacy Statement</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/gen/pad/privacy.html">UNSW
Privacy Statement </a>. AustLII's privacy policies are consistent with
those of our Universities, and the UTS and UNSW Privacy Statements should
be read in conjunction with this Privacy Policy. This document sets out
privacy policies particular to the operation of the AustLII website.
</p><p>AustLII collects information about individuals for the purpose of operating the
AustLII free access web site &lt;<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/">www.austlii.edu.au</a>&gt; and also to operate
the WorldLII free access website &lt;<a href="http://www.worldlii.org/">www.worldlii.org</a>&gt;, and for directly related purposes including educational purposes arising from AustLII's
role as part of two Universities. References to 'AustLII' in this document
also apply to the WorldLII website.
</p><p>AustLII collects two main categories of information about individuals, further
details of which are set out below:
<br>A. Information concerning usage of AustLII
<br>B. Information about individuals contained in AustLII databases
</p><h2>
A. Information concerning usage of AustLII</h2>
<b>A1.</b> AustLII collects information which identifies, for each page
accessed on AustLII, the network identity of the machine which has accessed
it. AustLII retains this usage information for purposes of network analysis,
usage analysis, and research into usage patterns for the purpose of improving
AustLII services. Access to and use of this information is restricted to
AustLII management and staff, and to researchers working on AustLII projects
and subject to an agreement to adhere to this Privacy Policy.
<p><b>A2.</b> AustLII does not disclose or publish information which identifies
individual machines,or potentially identifying sub-groupings of addresses,
unless we obtain consent or otherwise in accordance with legal requirements.
AustLII does publish aggregated information about usage patterns.
</p><p><b>A3.</b> AustLII may also gather more extensive information that stated
above (i) about any attempted access to AustLII which raise security issues
(and, where necessary, to make disclosures to relevant authorities); and
(ii) for network analyses on an occasional basis. AustLII may also collect
and use more extensive information about individuals in the circumstances set out
under 'Exceptions to the Rule' in the <a href="http://www.unsw.edu.au/gen/pad/privacy.html">UNSW
Privacy Statement </a>.
</p><p><b>A4.</b> If you contact AustLII via email (at our Feedback address
or otherwise) we will only use your email address and any information about individuals
you provide to us for the purposes for which the information is provided.
It will not be added to a mailing list without your consent.
</p><p><b>A5.</b> Cookies are not used by AustLII to collect information.
</p><h2>
B. Information about individuals contained in AustLII databases</h2>
<b>B1.</b> Some AustLII databases contain information about individuals, including
the decisions of Courts and Tribunals, and the reports of Royal Commissions.
AustLII publishes these databases with the consent of the public bodies
concerned. It is the responsibility of the public bodies which provide
these databases to AustLII to determine, subject to the requirements of
the laws under which they operate, the appropriate balance between the
privacy interests of individuals and the public interests in dissemination
of the information. In particular, if information about individuals is to be anonymised
before publication, or after publication due to factors such as spent
convictions
legislation, this is done by the public body concerned. AustLII complies
with applicable legal restrictions on publication, but does not and can
not censor part or all of the information provided by these public bodies
for publication.
<p><b>B2.</b> AustLII does not give a general consent to the contents of
these databases being indexed by other web sites. AustLII attempts to prevent
such indexing occurring by placing these database outside the permitted
scope of web 'crawlers', 'robots' or 'spiders' that adhere to the voluntary
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html">Robot
Exclusion Standard</a>. AustLII makes an exception to this general rule
in some cases to allow other law web sites to index selected AustLII databases.
</p><p>AustLII also monitors whether any robots attempt to index these databases
in disregard of this Standard, and takes steps to exclude any that do so
from any access to AustLII.
</p><p><b>B3.</b> AustLII users should note that there are legal limitations
on the use, publication and dissemination of some information about individuals
contained in AustLII databases, either relating specifically to certain
databases (eg <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s121.html">section
121</a> of the <a href="/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/">Family Law
Act 1975</a>) or relating to material found in any databases (eg Commonwealth
and State laws concerning juvenile offenders or sexual offences). There
is also legislation in most Australian jurisdictions providing limited
protection against the disclosure of old convictions (often after a period
of ten years) provided that the person concerned has not been re-convicted
within that period ('spent convictions').
</p><p><b>B4.</b> Other legal publishers (both online and in print, free access
and commercial) publish the same cases as are included on AustLII. If any
person considers that&nbsp; any case in an AustLII database may contain
information which it should not include, AustLII suggests that they should
contact the Registrar of the Court or Tribunal concerned, setting out the
reasons why there is information in a case which should not be published.
The Court or Tribunal is then in a position to inform all previous recipients
of the case of any matters that need to be changed.
</p><p><b>B5. </b>If a person informs AustLII (or AustLII becomes aware from
any other source)&nbsp; that any case (or other document) in an AustLII
database may contain information which it should not include, AustLII adopts
the following procedure:
</p><li>
AustLII will bring the matter to the attention of the Court or Tribunal
(or other body) concerned&nbsp; and will obtain its advice concerning whether
the case is to be removed, is to be replaced by an alternative version
of the case (including an anonymised version in some situations), or is
to remain as it currently stands.</li>

<li>
In all instances to date, AustLII has followed the advice provided by the
Court or Tribunal.</li>

<h2>
<b>C. Contact and other information</b></h2>
AustLII may be contacted at this address: Australasian Legal Information
Insitute, c/- Faculty of Law, University of Technology, Sydney, Box 123

to <a href="/austlii/feedback.html">send email to our Feedback address
&lt;feedback@austlii.edu.au&gt;</a>.
</p><p>Due to the developing nature of privacy principles for online communication,
this policy may be modified or expanded in light of new developments or
issues that may arise from&nbsp; time to time. The amended policy will
be posted to this site and will operate from the time it is posted.
