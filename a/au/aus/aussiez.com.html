	<h3>Commitment</h3>
	<p>
		Aussiez is a social networking site where people can create their profiles, connect with their old friends and new people. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of Aussiez's policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to us through our Website.<br><br>
		Aussiez ("Aussiez", "us" or "we") respects the privacy of the visitors to its Website. <br>
		Aussiez may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes by placing a prominent notice on this page and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br>
		If any change is unacceptable to you, you must cease using our Website. Continued use of our Website following notice of any such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Information we collect</h3>
	<p>
		You agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Information according to this Privacy Policy. <br><br>
		The security of your personal information depends on your protection of your account password. Please do not disclose your account password to any other person. Please bear in mind though, that it is impossible for Aussiez to guarantee all necessary security measures. For example, we cannot control any illegal and/or unforeseen activity of other users that may allow them to get around the privacy or security settings on the Aussiez website. Consequently, you acknowledge that there are circumstances in which your personal information may be accessed by unauthorized persons.<br><br>
		We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through our Website:<br>
		When you start registration process to have access to the Aussiez Services as a Member, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We will collect any other information, including but not limited to your age, your hobbies and interests and other content, such as photos, music and videos, when you enter this information in your profile.<br><br>
		When you enter Personal Information throughout the Aussiez network using one of the features of the Aussiez network, for example journals, testimonials, groups, or message boards, lifestyle choices, groups with whom you are affiliated (schools, companies), private messages, bulletins or personal statements (collectively "Profile Information"), we will collect any such information you enter. Aussiez recommends that you exercise discretion in deciding what information you disclose on the Internet.<br><br>
		When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, we will collect your e-mail addresses and any information contained in the e-mail you send us.<br><br>
		Once you register with Aussiez and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. If you are browsing the Website without registering with Aussiez, you are anonymous to us, but we will collect the information with all available technologies. Whether you are Member or Visitor of the Aussiez Website, we receive and store information which is transmitted automatically from your computer when you browse the Internet and use Aussiez. This information includes information from cookies, your IP address and browser type (which are described in section below).<br><br>
		If you become aware of any breach of data security or have any other questions about the security of our website, please contact us via the Contact Us page.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Cookies and information collected via technologies</h3>
	<p>
		Certain information may also be automatically collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Website you clicked. This type of information is collected to make our services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the Aussiez community experience to meet your special interests and needs.<br>
		If you search the Aussiez community by using a toolbar that Aussiez, or a third party provides, we may collect Anonymous Information about you automatically, but we will not collect Personal Information.<br><br>
		An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track your IP Address when you login to the Website.<br><br>
		"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. Cookies are a common Internet technology and most Internet browsers (such as Internet Explorer and Safari) are initially set up to accept cookies. Aussiez may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the Website may not work properly.<br>
		Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on web pages within the Aussiez network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
		Aussiez may link information stored in cookies such as your age, gender and country with your personally identifiable information and we may use such information to gather statistics about the number of people who visit Aussiez and to customize Aussiez's content, layout and services for delivery to you.<br><br>
		Our advertising partners may set and access cookies or use other technologies such as web beacons (which are electronic files that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies) in order to personalize advertising content. Use by these advertising partners of their own cookies and any other tracking technologies are subject to their privacy policies. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Use of Information</h3>
	<p>
		We will display your personal information on your profile according to the preferences you set. We will use your name so that you are recognizable on our database and so that we can personalize your experience. We will use your email address to contact you from time to time and may also use it for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. <br><br>
		You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the Aussiez Website. <br>
		 In order to provide useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in joining the Aussiez, we may use your profile information and photos on the Aussiez website and when we send emails, for example when we send birthday reminders to Aussiez members or when we send general newsletters to members of Aussiez. When you decide to view a member's profile, we may show that Aussiez member that you choose to view their profile. If you don't want us to show to other Aussiez members that you viewed their profile, you can change this in your privacy settings.<br><br>
		The Personal Information that Aussiez members enter into the Aussiez profile will be used for the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like location or gender.<br>
		Aussiez may analyze any collected information for its own internal purposes, for instance we may use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to gather statistics about the number of people who visit Aussiez and to customize Aussiez's content, layout and services. We also may share this information with third parties to help us improve Aussiez and better serve our users.<br><br>
		We limit access to personal information about you to employees and third parties who we reasonably believe need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. <br>
		However, no company, including Aussiez, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.<br><br>
		Advertisements that appear on Aussiez are delivered to you by our advertising partners. Aussiez may transfer information about your use of Aussiez, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to our advertising partners and other third parties. This information may be used to provide advertising, promotions and other products and services that may be of particular interest to you. It may also be used to provide you with a tailored choice of content and media products. If you do not want to receive targeted advertisements at any point in the future, please change your advertisement preferences in your account or send a request to us via the Contact Us page.<br><br>
		Our advertising and promotions partners have no access to your name or personal contact information stored by Aussiez unless you choose to share it with them. Aussiez does not provide your name or personal contact information to an advertising partner when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement.<br><br>
		We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. Such third party entities will be obligated to use your personally identifiable information solely to provide the services to us.<br><br>
		We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect the rights and property of Aussiez.com, its affiliates or the public. We may also co-operate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant agency or authority in doing so.<br><br>
		We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Aussiez.com, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. If an acquiring company should plan to materially change this privacy policy, we will notify you beforehand.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Sharing of the information</h3>
	<p>
		Except as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your Membership. However, Aussiez may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members and other users of the Aussiez website more targeted advertising, products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth above, Aussiez may (i) use your email address to conduct market research for Aussiez's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email address to market Aussiez to you (e.g., new features and applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). Aussiez may contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing; provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality to Aussiez and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by Aussiez other than as expressly instructed by Aussiez and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
