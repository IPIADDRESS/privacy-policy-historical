	<p>
		We usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it.</p>

		We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication.</p>

	<h4>
		Online links to third parties and co-branded sites</h4>
	<p>
		News may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners.

</div>
<div>
	<h4>
		Other things you should know about privacy on the Internet</h4>

	<p>
