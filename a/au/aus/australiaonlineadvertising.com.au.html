		We usually collect personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and in some instances, your financial details. When you are online, we collect information regarding the pages within our network which you visit and what you click on. As a general rule we do not collect sensitive information. However, if we do, it will usually be for the purposes of providing our goods or services and if the law requires us to, we will seek your consent to collect it.</p>

		We use your information to provide our services to you, to fulfill administrative functions associated with these services, for example billing, to enter into contracts with you or third parties and for marketing and client relationship purposes. Where your personal information is contained within an advertisement which we publish for you, we may also use your information for publication of that same advertisement in other media, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the initial publication.</p>

	<h4>
		Cookies</h4>
	<p>
		Cookies are data that a Web site transfers to an individualâ€™s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can facilitate a userâ€™s ongoing access to and use of a site. They allow us to track usage patterns and to compile data that can help us improve our content and target advertising. If you do not want information collected through the use of Cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the Cookie feature. But you should note that Cookies may be necessary to provide you with features such as merchandise transactions or registered services.</p>

<div>
	<h4>
		Online links to third parties and co-branded sites</h4>
	<p>
		News may establish relationships with business partners that allow visitors to our Internet sites to link directly to sites operated by these partners. Some of these sites may be "co-branded" with our logo; however, these sites may not be operated or maintained by or on our behalf. These sites may collect personal information from you that may be shared with us. This Privacy Statement will apply to any personal information we obtain in this manner.</p>
	<p>
		News is not responsible for the content or practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are meant for the userâ€™s convenience only.

Once you have left our site via such a link, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h4>
		Other things you should know about privacy on the Internet</h4>

This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafÃ©. You as an individual are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer.</p>
	<p>
		Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet.</p>
