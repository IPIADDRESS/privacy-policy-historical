			  <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
			  <h2>Effective 1st October 2007  </h2>
			  <h3>1. Collection</h3>
			  <p>1.1 Westvic Broadband Pty Ld, trading as .Aussie  Broadband (Aussie Broadband) will not collect personal information unless the  information is necessary for one or more of its functions or activities. <br>
			    1.2 Aussie Broadband will not collect personal  information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive  way. <br>
			    1.3 At or before the time (or, if that is not  practicable, as soon as practicable after) Aussie Broadband collects personal  information about an individual from the individual, Aussie Broadband must take  reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of:<br>
			    (a) the  identity of Aussie Broadband and how to contact it; and<br>
			    (b) the  fact that he or she is able to gain access to the information; and<br>
			    (c) the  purposes for which the information is collected; and<br>
			    (d) Aussie  Broadband’s (or the types of organisations) to which Aussie Broadband usually  discloses information of that kind; and<br>
			    (e) any law  that requires the particular information to be collected; and<br>
			    (f) the  main consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the information  is not provided.<br>
			    1.4 If it is reasonable and practicable to do so, Aussie  Broadband must collect personal information about an individual only from that  individual.<br>
			    1.5 If Aussie Broadband collects personal information  about an individual from someone else, it must take reasonable steps to ensure  that the individual is or has been made aware of the matters listed in  subclause 1.3 except to the extent that making the individual aware of the  matters would pose a serious threat to the life or health of any individual. </p>
			  <h3>2. Use and  disclosure</h3>
			  <p>2.1 Aussie Broadband must not use or disclose  personal information about an individual for a purpose (the <strong><em>secondary  purpose</em></strong>) other than the primary purpose of collection unless:<br>
			    (a) both of  the following apply:<br>
			    (i) the  secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and, if the  personal information is sensitive information, directly related to the primary  purpose of collection;<br>
			    (ii) the  individual would reasonably expect Aussie Broadband to use or disclose the  information for the secondary purpose; or<br>
			    (b) the  individual has consented to the use or disclosure; or<br>
			    (c) if the  information is not sensitive information and the use of the information is for  the secondary purpose of direct marketing:<br>
			    (i) it is  impracticable for Aussie Broadband to seek the individual’s consent before that  particular use; and<br>
			    (ii) Aussie  Broadband will not charge the individual for giving effect to a request by the  individual to Aussie Broadband not to receive direct marketing communications;  and<br>
			    (iii) the  individual has not made a request to Aussie Broadband not to receive direct  marketing communications; and<br>
			    (iv) in  each direct marketing communication with the individual, Aussie Broadband draws  to the individual’s attention, or prominently displays a notice, that he or she  may express a wish not to receive any further direct marketing communications;  and<br>
			    (v) each  written direct marketing communication by Aussie Broadband with the individual  (up to and including the communication that involves the use) sets out Aussie  Broadband’s business address and telephone number and, if the communication  with the individual is made by fax, telex or other electronic means, a number  or address at which Aussie Broadband can be directly contacted electronically;  or<br>
			    (d) if the  information is health information and the use or disclosure is necessary for  research, or the compilation or analysis of statistics, relevant to public  health or public safety:<br>
			    (i) it is  impracticable for Aussie Broadband to seek the individual’s consent before the  use or disclosure; and<br>
			    (ii) the  use or disclosure is conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the  Commissioner under section&nbsp;95A for the purposes of this subparagraph; and<br>
			    (iii) in  the case of disclosure, Aussie Broadband reasonably believes that the recipient  of the health information will not disclose the health information, or personal  information derived from the health information; or<br>
			    (e) Aussie  Broadband reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen  or prevent:<br>
			    (i) a  serious and imminent threat to an individual’s life, health or safety; or<br>
			    (ii) a  serious threat to public health or public safety; or<br>
			    (f) Aussie  Broadband has reason to suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or  may be engaged in, and uses or discloses the personal information as a  necessary part of its investigation of the matter or in reporting its concerns  to relevant persons or authorities; or<br>
			    (g) the use  or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or<br>
			    (h) Aussie  Broadband reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably  necessary for one or more of the following by or on behalf of an enforcement  body:<br>
			    (i) the  prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal  offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a  prescribed law;<br>
			    (ii) the  enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime;<br>
			    (iii) the  protection of the public revenue;<br>
			    (iv) the  prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct  or prescribed conduct;<br>
			    (v) the  preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or  implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal.<br>
			    Note 1: Aussie  Broadband will not withhold any information and will fully co-operate with  agencies performing law enforcement functions in the performance of their  functions.<br>
			    Note 2:  Subclause 2.1 does not override any existing legal obligations not to disclose  personal information. Nothing in subclause 2.1 requires Aussie Broadband to  disclose personal information; Aussie Broadband is always entitled not to  disclose personal information in the absence of a legal obligation to disclose  it.<br>
			    Note 3: Aussie  Broadband is also subject to the requirements of National Privacy Principle 9  if it transfers personal information to a person in a foreign country.<br>
			    2.2 If Aussie Broadband uses or discloses personal  information under paragraph 2.1(h), it must make a written note of the use or  disclosure.</p>
			  <p>2.3 Subclause 2.1 operates in relation to personal  information that Aussie Broadband that is a body corporate has collected from a  related body corporate as if Aussie Broadband’s primary purpose of collection  of the information were the primary purpose for which the related body  corporate collected the information.<br>
			    2.4 Despite subclause 2.1, Aussie Broadband that  provides a health service to an individual may disclose health information about  the individual to a person who is responsible for the individual if:<br>
			    (a) the  individual:<br>
			    (i) is  physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the disclosure; or<br>
			    (ii)  physically cannot communicate consent to the disclosure; and<br>
			    (b) a  natural person (the <strong><em>carer</em></strong>) providing the health service for Aussie  Broadband is satisfied that either:<br>
			    (i) the  disclosure is necessary to provide appropriate care or treatment of the  individual; or<br>
			    (ii) the  disclosure is made for compassionate reasons; and<br>
			    (c) the disclosure  is not contrary to any wish:<br>
			    (i)  expressed by the individual before the individual became unable to give or  communicate consent; and<br>
			    (ii) of  which the carer is aware, or of which the carer could reasonably be expected to  be aware; and<br>
			    (d) the disclosure  is limited to the extent reasonable and necessary for a purpose mentioned in  paragraph&nbsp;(b).<br>
			    2.5 For the purposes of subclause 2.4, a person is <strong><em>responsible</em></strong> for an individual if the person is:<br>
			    (a) a  parent of the individual; or<br>
			    (b) a child  or sibling of the individual and at least 18 years old; or<br>
			    (c) a  spouse or de facto spouse of the individual; or<br>
			    (d) a  relative of the individual, at least 18 years old and a member of the  individual’s household; or<br>
			    (e) a  guardian of the individual; or<br>
			    (f)  exercising an enduring power of attorney granted by the individual that is  exercisable in relation to decisions about the individual’s health; or<br>
			    (g) a  person who has an intimate personal relationship with the individual; or<br>
			    (h) a  person nominated by the individual to be contacted in case of emergency.<br>
			    2.6 In subclause 2.5:<br>
  <strong><em>child</em></strong> of an individual  includes an adopted child, a step-child and a foster-child, of the individual.<br>
  <strong><em>parent</em></strong> of an individual  includes a step-parent, adoptive parent and a foster-parent, of the individual.<br>
  <strong><em>relative</em></strong> of an individual means a  grandparent, grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece, of the individual.<br>
  <strong><em>sibling</em></strong> of an individual  includes a half-brother, half-sister, adoptive brother, adoptive sister,  step-brother, step-sister, foster-brother and foster-sister, of the individual. <br>
  <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/#top">Back  to Top</a> </p>
			  <h3>3. Data quality</h3>
			  <p>Aussie Broadband must take reasonable steps to make  sure that the personal information it collects uses or discloses is accurate,  complete and up-to-date.</p>
			  <h3>4. Data  security</h3>
			  <p>4.1 Aussie Broadband must take reasonable steps to  protect the personal information it holds from misuse and loss and from  unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.<br>
			    4.2 Aussie Broadband must take reasonable steps to  destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer  needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed under  National Privacy Principle 2.</p>
			  <h3>5. Openness</h3>
			  <p>5.1 Aussie Broadband must set out in a document  clearly expressed policies on its management of personal information. Aussie  Broadband must make the document available to anyone who asks for it.<br>
			    5.2 On request by a person, Aussie Broadband must  take reasonable steps to let the person know, generally, what sort of personal  information it holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, holds, uses and  discloses that information. </p>
			  <h3>6. Access and  correction</h3>
			  <p>6.1 If Aussie Broadband holds personal information  about an individual, it must provide the individual with access to the  information on request by the individual, except to the extent that: <br>
			    (a) in the  case of personal information other than health information, providing access  would pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of any individual;  or<br>
			    (b) in the  case of health information, providing access would pose a serious threat to the  life or health of any individual; or<br>
			    (c)  providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other  individuals; or<br>
			    (d) the  request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or<br>
			    (e) the  information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between Aussie  Broadband and the individual, and the information would not be accessible by  the process of discovery in those proceedings; or<br>
			    (f)  providing access would reveal the intentions of Aussie Broadband in relation to  negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those  negotiations; or<br>
			    (g)  providing access would be unlawful; or<br>
			    (h) denying  access is required or authorised by or under law; or<br>
			    (i)  providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible  unlawful activity; or<br>
			    (j)  providing access would be likely to prejudice:<br>
			    (i) the  prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences,  breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of a prescribed  law; or<br>
			    (ii) the  enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; or<br>
			    (iii) the  protection of the public revenue; or<br>
			    (iv) the  prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct  or prescribed conduct; or<br>
			    (v) the  preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or  implementation of its orders;<br>
			    by or on  behalf of an enforcement body; or<br>
			    (k) an enforcement  body performing a lawful security function asks Aussie Broadband not to provide  access to the information on the basis that providing access would be likely to  cause damage to the security of Australia.<br>
			    6.2 However, where providing access would reveal  evaluative information generated within Aussie Broadband in connection with a  commercially sensitive decision-making process, Aussie Broadband may give the  individual an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than  direct access to the information.<br>
			    Note: Aussie  Broadband breaches subclause 6.1 if it relies on subclause 6.2 to give an  individual an explanation for a commercially sensitive decision in  circumstances where subclause 6.2 does not apply.<br>
			    6.3 If Aussie Broadband is not required to provide  the individual with access to the information because of one or more of  paragraphs 6.1(a) to (k) (inclusive), Aussie Broadband must, if reasonable,  consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow  sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.<br>
			    6.4 If Aussie Broadband charges for providing access  to personal information, those charges:<br>
			    (a) will  not be excessive; and<br>
			    (b) will  not apply to lodging a request for access.<br>
			    6.5 If Aussie Broadband holds personal information  about an individual and the individual is able to establish that the  information is not accurate, complete and up-to-date, Aussie Broadband must  take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate,  complete and up-to-date.<br>
			    6.6 If the individual and Aussie Broadband disagree  about whether the information is accurate, complete and up-to-date, and the  individual asks Aussie Broadband to associate with the information a statement  claiming that the information is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, Aussie  Broadband must take reasonable steps to do so. <br>
			    6.7 Aussie Broadband must provide reasons for denial  of access or a refusal to correct personal information. </p>
			  <h3>7. Identifiers</h3>
			  <p>7.1 Aussie Broadband must not adopt as its own  identifier of an individual an identifier of the individual that has been  assigned by:<br>
			    (a) an  agency; or<br>
			    (b) an  agent of an agency acting in its capacity as agent; or<br>
			    (c) a  contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract acting in its capacity  as contracted service provider for that contract.<br>
			    7.1A However, subclause 7.1 does not apply to the  adoption by a prescribed organisation of a prescribed identifier in prescribed  circumstances.<br>
			    Note: There  are prerequisites that must be satisfied before those matters are prescribed:  see subsection 100(2).<br>
			    7.2 Aussie Broadband must not use or disclose an  identifier assigned to an individual by an agency, or by an agent or contracted  service provider mentioned in subclause 7.1, unless:<br>
			    (a) the use  or disclosure is necessary for Aussie Broadband to fulfil its obligations to  the agency; or<br>
			    (b) one or  more of paragraphs 2.1(e) to 2.1(h) (inclusive) apply to the use or disclosure;  or<br>
			    (c) the use  or disclosure is by a prescribed organisation of a prescribed identifier in  prescribed circumstances.<br>
			    Note: There  are prerequisites that must be satisfied before the matters mentioned in  paragraph&nbsp;(c) are prescribed: see subsection 100(2).<br>
			    7.3 In this clause:<br>
  <strong><em>identifier</em></strong> includes a number  assigned by Aussie Broadband to an individual to identify uniquely the  individual for the purposes of Aussie Broadband’s operations. However, an  individual’s name or ABN (as defined in the <em>A New Tax System (Australian  Business Number) Act 1999</em>) is not an <strong><em>identifier</em></strong>. </p>
			  <h3>8. Anonymity</h3>
			  <p>Wherever it is lawful and practicable, individuals  must have the option of not identifying themselves when entering transactions  with Aussie Broadband. </p>
			  <h3>9. Transborder  data flows</h3>
			  <p>Aussie Broadband in Australia or an external Territory  may transfer personal information about an individual to someone (other than Aussie  Broadband or the individual) who is in a foreign country only if:<br>
			    (a) Aussie  Broadband reasonably believes that the recipient of the information is subject  to a law, binding scheme or contract which effectively upholds principles for  fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the National  Privacy Principles; or<br>
			    (b) the  individual consents to the transfer; or<br>
			    (c) the  transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual  and Aussie Broadband, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures  taken in response to the individual’s request; or<br>
			    (d) the  transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded  in the interest of the individual between Aussie Broadband and a third party;  or<br>
			    (e) all of  the following apply:<br>
			    (i) the  transfer is for the benefit of the individual;<br>
			    (ii) it is  impracticable to obtain the consent of the individual to that transfer;<br>
			    (iii) if it  were practicable to obtain such consent, the individual would be likely to give  it; or<br>
			    (f) Aussie  Broadband has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information which it  has transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the  information inconsistently with the National Privacy Principles.</p>
			  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
			  <h3>10. Sensitive  information</h3>
			  <p>10.1 Aussie Broadband must not collect sensitive  information about an individual unless: <br>
			    (a) the  individual has consented; or<br>
			    (b) the  collection is required by law; or<br>
			    (c) the  collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to  the life or health of any individual, where the individual whom the information  concerns:<br>
			    (i) is  physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the collection; or<br>
			    (ii)  physically cannot communicate consent to the collection; or<br>
			    (d) if the  information is collected in the course of the activities of a non-profit  organisation, the following conditions are satisfied:<br>
			    (i) the  information relates solely to the members of Aussie Broadband or to individuals  who have regular contact with it in connection with its activities;<br>
			    (ii) at or  before the time of collecting the information, Aussie Broadband undertakes to  the individual whom the information concerns that Aussie Broadband will not  disclose the information without the individual’s consent; or<br>
			    (e) the  collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal  or equitable claim.<br>
			    10.2 Despite subclause 10.1, Aussie Broadband may  collect health information about an individual if:<br>
			    (a) the  information is necessary to provide a health service to the individual; and<br>
			    (b) the  information is collected:<br>
			    (i) as  required by law (other than this Act); or<br>
			    (ii) in  accordance with rules established by competent health or medical bodies that  deal with obligations of professional confidentiality which bind Aussie  Broadband.<br>
			    10.3 Despite subclause 10.1, Aussie Broadband may  collect health information about an individual if:<br>
