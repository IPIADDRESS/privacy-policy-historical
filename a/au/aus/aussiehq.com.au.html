		</h2>
            <p>
			This document is a summary of the way AussieHQ manages personal information it collects on:
		</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
				people who access its website; and
			</li>
              <li>
				people who contract with the company for the provision of services ('customer').
			</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
			
		<span>The policy is based on the National Privacy Principles that apply to private businesses under the Privacy Act, 1988 (Commonwealth). The National Privacy Guidelines can be accessed at </span><a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/business/guidelines/index">www.privacy.gov.au/business/guidelines/index</a><span>.</span></p>
            <p>
			In summary, our policy is to:
		</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
				collect only as much personal information on you as we require to provide you with an effective service and meet our legal obligations;
			</li>
              <li>
				hold the information in a secure manner;
			</li>
              <li>
				give you access to the information if you request it and the means to change it if it is incorrect; and
			</li>
              <li>
				destroy or de-identify personal information when it is no longer required.
			</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
			This policy statement may be amended from time to time. Our website will always display the up-to-date version.

            <p>
			There are inherent risks in transmitting information across the Internet. We can give no absolute guarantee that all data, including personal information, provided via the Internet is secure from unauthorized use.
		</p>
            <p>
			Personal details you provide via chat rooms and similar forums, whether sponsored or endorsed by us or by web sites we host, are in the public domain and as such are not covered by this privacy policy.
		</p>
            <p>
			AussieHQ hosts web sites owned and operated by other people. This privacy policy does not necessarily extend to any personal information they might collect in the course of their operations.

			The Personal Information we hold

We will seek your agreement before any voice recording is made. We also hold copies of any correspondence that passes between us.
		</p>
            <p>
			From time to time we may survey our customers to assist us in planning and delivering better services. The provision of this information will be voluntary and our intended use will be clearly identified at the time of collection.
		</p>
            <p>
			We will not sell or otherwise make available the personal details of our clients to third parties, other than a limited number of providers we contract to supply support services to AussieHQ in the normal course of our business. We require such providers to comply with our privacy policy when dealing with our clients' information and we only provide as much information as is necessary for them to provide their services to us.
		</p>
            <h2 id="security">

		</p>
            <p>
			We will take all reasonable steps to delete or permanently de-identify personal information we hold on you if you cease to be our client and we no longer need the information to finalise any outstanding matters.
		</p>
            <h2 id="disclosure">
			Disclosure of Personal Information

            <p>

		</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
