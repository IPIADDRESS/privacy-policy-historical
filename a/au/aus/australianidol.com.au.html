                          </li>
	                  </ol>
		                <p>The personal information that the Organization may collect on an individual will vary depending on which of the above categories 1-6 apply to an individual. Sometimes an individual’s name, address and phone/fax/e-mail details will be sufficient. Otherwise much more information may be required for our purposes but we will not collect or ask for information that we do not need for one or more of our administration or business functions and related activities.</p>
		                <p>Sometimes we may need to collect sensitive information on individuals such as health, ethnic background, race or union membership details. We will not collect sensitive information if it is not necessary for one or more of our administration or business functions and related activities. </p>
	                  <h4>What Do We Do With Personal Information?</h4>
		                <p>This will depend into which category, 1- above, an individual falls.</p>
		                <p>Contestants in category 1 will be given a “Privacy Statement” about what we will do with their personal information, where practical, at the time of any audition or soon after, and if they are successful, on becoming a contestant.</p>
		                <p>Individuals in categories 2 and 3 will be sent a letter explaining what we do with their personal information.</p>
		                <p>Personal Information on individuals in category 4 will be dealt with in accordance with the rules and regulations of each competition/promotion, with the NPPs and this Privacy Policy.</p>
		                <p>Personal Information on individuals in categories 5 and 6 will only be used to the extent it is necessary for the completion of the engagement of services, contract and/or any ongoing or renewed arrangement or trading/business relationship with us.</p>
	                  <h4>Who Will Have Access To Personal Information We Have?</h4>
		                <p>The Organization is not in the business of dealing with personal information or data for commercial purposes outside of its normal business activities (for example, for sale to third parties). Contestants and competition/promotion entrants’ personal information may be supplied to the program or competition prize suppliers.</p>
		                <p>The Organization is part of a worldwide organization with associated offices overseas. The ultimate holding company is the Bertelsmann Group. Accounting, audit, management, contestant and program production information may need to be disclosed to our related offices overseas. This will only be done in a manner consistent with the NPPs.</p>
		                <h4>Storage Of Data</h4>
		                <p>We store personal information for varying periods of time depending on the purpose for which it is collected. In accordance with the NPPs this will be stored in a secure manner and made available only to those employees and management who need access to the information in order to perform their roles. Once we determine that we no longer require the personal information it will be destroyed in a secure manner.</p>
		                <h4>Access To Personal Information</h4>
		                <p>Subject to some exceptions you have the right to request access to any personal information held by the Organization, which relates to you, in accordance with the NPPs. Sometimes it may be impractical to provide you access to this information without cost. For example, provision of information which is very old or held on program tapes. The Organization will determine and charge appropriate fees from time to time as it sees fit for providing access in those circumstances. Ordinarily, copies of personal information held in files or electronically can be provided for nominal handling/postage fees. In order for you to access information you must provide us with sufficient information to enable us to properly identify you. Any requests for access must be made in writing to the contestant co-ordinator of the program in which you appeared if you were a contestant or for all other matters to the Privacy Officer at the address below. </p>
		                <p>If personal information held by the Organization is inaccurate or out of date you have the right to request it to be updated or corrected. If there is a dispute as to whether the information we hold is correct or out of date the Privacy Officer will endeavour to resolve this.</p>
		                <h4>Disclosure Of This Privacy Policy</h4>
		                <p>We will make copies of this privacy policy available upon written request. Due to the changing nature of the personal information we may collect and our business, we reserve the right to change this Policy from time to time as our needs dictate.</p>
		                <p>If on receipt of this Policy you have questions about how we deal with personal information these should be forwarded in writing to the Privacy Officer at the address below, as should any complaints.</p>
