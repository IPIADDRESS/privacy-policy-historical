        <ul>
            <li>required or permitted by law; or </li>
            <li>with your express or implied consent. </li>

        <h3><a name="Direct_Mail"></a>Direct Mail</h3>
        <p>Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information via the mail we may do so with your implied consent.

We will ensure that our opt out notices are clear, conspicuous and easy to take up.</p>
        <h3><a name="Electronic_Marketing"></a>Electronic Marketing</h3>
        <p>Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information by e-mail, SMS, MMS or other electronic means we may do so with your express consent. You may give us your express consent by, for example, ticking a box on an electronic or paper form where we seek your permission to send you electronic or other marketing information. <br>
        All of our electronic marketing activities will comply with the requirements of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth). </p>
        <h3><a name="Telemarketing"></a>Telemarketing</h3>
        <p>Australia Post usually does not engage in telemarketing activities to our consumer customers. Generally, such marketing is ever only used in relation to our business customers.

        <ul>
            <li>Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth); </li>

        <h2><a name="Information_Sharing"></a>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We have a strict duty to keep confidential and private all personal information we hold about you. However, certain exceptions do apply. For example, where disclosure of your personal information is : </p>

            <li><strong>authorised or required by law</strong> <br>
            e.g. disclosure to various government departments and agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, CentreLink, Child Support Agency, or disclosure to courts under subpoena. </li>
            <li><strong>in the public interest</strong> <br>
            e.g. where a crime, fraud or misdemeanour is committed or suspected, and disclosure against the customer's rights to confidentiality is justified. </li>
            <li><strong>with your consent</strong> <br>
            Your consent may be implied or express and it may also be verbal or written. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Use_of_third_party_service_providers"></a>Use of third party service providers</h3>
        <p>When we temporarily provide personal information to companies who perform services for us, such as specialist information technology companies, mail houses or other contractors to Australia Post we require those companies to protect your personal information as diligently as we do. Stringent contractual and other quality assurance measures are used to ensure your personal information is protected. </p>
        <h2><a name="Information_collected_on_this_web_site"></a>Information collected on this web site</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>the type of browser and operating system you are using. </li>
            <li>your Internet Service Provider and top level domain name (for example - .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc). </li>

            <li>your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address (a number which is unique to the machine through which you are connected to the internet). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this information is used by Australia Post for aggregated statistical analyses or systems administration purposes only. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities, except where required by or under law. </p>
        <h3><a name="Cookies"></a>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A "cookie" is a packet of information that allows the Australia Post server (the computer that houses our web site) to identify and interact more effectively with your computer. </p>
        <p>When you access our web site, we send you a temporary or "<strong>session cookie</strong>" that gives you a unique identification number. A different identification number is sent each time you use our web site. Cookies do not identify individual users, although they do identify a user's internet browser type and your Internet Service Provider. Shortly after you end your interaction with our web site, the cookie expires or "crumbles". This means it no longer exists on your computer and therefore cannot be used for further identification or access to your computer. </p>
        <p>Without cookies certain personalised services cannot be provided to users of our website, accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Australia Post website features if cookies have been disabled. </p>
        <h3><a name="Cookie_Policy"></a>Cookie Policy</h3>
        <p>We use session cookies in the following manner: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log-on and log-off administration </strong>- If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you. </li>
            <li><strong>Transactions and site usability </strong>- We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through our website and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to re-enter the same information twice. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from www.auspost.com.au. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Australia Post may also use "<strong>persistent cookies</strong>". A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer's hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. Australia Post will not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent. </p>
        <p>We use persistent cookies as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Site usage measurement </strong>- Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our web site and its various components are used. It functions as a "visit cookie," so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit. </li>
            <li><strong>Log-off safety function </strong>- Australia Post uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of certain Australia Post sites if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site, but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity. </li>
            <li><strong>Opt-in cookies </strong>- Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognize you when you return to www.auspost.com,au or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to certain Australia Post sites automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your site activity. This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you banner ads about other products you may be interested in. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your request and for your convenience. </p>
        <p>We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit. </p>
