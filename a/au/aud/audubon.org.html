<p>This policy covers Web sites owned or operated by Audubon. We encourage 
        you to take the time to read this privacy policy and those of any Web 
        site you visit.</p>
      <p>The National Audubon Society is one of the largest, most effective environmental 
        organizations dedicated to the protection and preservation of birds, other 
        wildlife and their habitats. Since our founding in 1905, we have approached 
        environmental issues in a manner reflected by nature itself –- with balance. 
        Our web site is designed as a tool for those interested in the environment 
        to become more involved in our mission. </p>
      <p>Audubon is concerned about our visitor’s Internet privacy and is committed 
        to honoring our constituents’ privacy preferences. We recognize that visitors 
        to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us 
        and how Audubon treats that information. Be assured, Audubon will never 
        misuse the information you provide. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Consumer Choice</p>
      </b> 
      <p>Audubon believes a visitor to our site is the one to best determine: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether -- and under what conditions –- a visitor should provide "personally 
          identifiable information" (e.g. data that may be used to identify, contact, 
          or locate a person). </li>
        <li>Whether Audubon should share such information with anyone. </li>
      </ul>
      <b> 
      <p>Informed Consent</p>
      </b> 
      <p>If Audubon needs to collect personally identifiable information, a visitor 
        to our site will be alerted and given an opportunity to restrict our use 
        of the information. Every visitor has the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Know when Audubon is collecting personal information. </li>
        <li>Know what personal information is collected, and the purpose of collection. 
        </li>
        <li>Expect the opportunity to choose whether or not personal information 
          will be provided to third parties. </li>
        <li>Expect reasonable steps to be taken to protect personal information 
          from unauthorized use. </li>
      </ul>
      <b> 
      <p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      </b> 
      <p>You can visit most portions of audubon.org without telling us who you 
        are and without revealing any personal information. The only information 
        we collect from a typical web site visit does not identify you. Rather, 
        it is the name of your Internet service provider ("ISP"), the 
        browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred 
        you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. 
        We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity 
        to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.</p>
      <p>Audubon does not sell or otherwise disclose such user information outside 
        the organization. <!-- unless you tell us it is okay to do so. We provide you 
        with clear directions on how to <u>opt-out</u> online, so that you are 
        always in control of your privacy.--> </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Personal Information Collected</p>
      </b> 
      <p>In general, when you visit our Web sites and access information you remain 
        anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information 
        to us to view our site. </p>
      <p>There are occasions, however, when we will ask for additional information. 
        We do this to better understand and respond to your needs, and provide 
        you with services that may be valuable to you. Audubon collects email 
        addresses and other personally identifiable data about you when such data 
        is voluntarily submitted. For example, personally identifiable information 
        will be collected in order for you to become a member of Audubon or to 
        register as an environmental activist online. Contact information from 
        order forms is used to send orders, invoices and information about Audubon 
        to you. Some of the activist functions of our site also require registration 
        of personal information. We use this information to track the usage of 
        these features and to help you gain access to the information you need 
        to most benefit the environment. All such information is collected and 
        stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data. Audubon makes 
        every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive 
        user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption 
        methodologies.</p>
      <p>Finally, you may decide to send Audubon personally identifying information, 
        for example, in a message containing information about membership. We 
        will only use this information to identify you and to determine how to 
        respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information for any 
        purpose other than to resolve the matter identified in the email. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Cookies</p>
      </b> 
      <p>What are "Cookies"?</p>
      <p>A cookie is a small text file sent to your computer’s hard drive by a 
        website’s server. Each time you return to the site that "set" 
        the cookie, the server retrieves its cookie from your computer and thereby 
        knows you are a previous visitor who has returned. Cookies may contain 
        information about your ISP, operating system, browser type, screen resolution 
        and number of colors, your computer’s processor type, your ISP’ss server, 
        your Internet protocol address, and what server you were last on. Other 
        information can be added to a cookie, but only information that you give 
        to us.</p>
      <b> 
      <p>Use of Cookies</p>
      </b> 
      <p>Audubon uses cookies written by our site, but not to obtain information 
        on other Web sites that you may visit. Cookies help us by providing some 
        history about the parts of our sites that you have visited. This enables 
        us to help you navigate our site more easily, to determine what pages 
        are most attractive to our visitors, and to alert you to related pages 
        on our site that may interest you. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Audubon’s Use of Information</p>
      </b> 
      <p>Personally identifiable information may sometimes be made available to 
        other non-profit organizations and occasionally to for-profit organizations 
        -- unless you request otherwise. Whether or not you choose to share your 
        information will have no impact on your interaction with us. If you would 
        not like to have your name traded with other companies, just tell us. 
        You can opt-out on-line or you can contact us via email at webmaster@audubon.org. 
        We will not provide any of your personal information to other organizations 
        if you elect to keep your record private.</p>
      <b> 
      <p>Security of Your Credit Card Information</p>
      </b> 
      <p>We have made every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission 
        of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection 
        and encryption methodologies.</p>
      <p>If you are still concerned about the safety of your credit card information 
        online, you may also submit contributions or other payment to Audubon 
        by mailing a check as directed by instructions on the appropriate pages 
        of our website. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Links to Third Party Sites</p>
      </b> 
      <p>We provide links to third party sites. Because we do not control those 
        Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these 
        third party sites. That another web site is linked to our site does not 
        constitute an endorsement by Audubon of the owner of the other site, the 
        content of its site, or its products or services.</p>
      <b> 
      <p>How to Unsubscribe from a Mailing list or our Email List</p>
      </b> 
      <p>If at any time you wish to stop receiving electronic information from 
        Audubon, or to be removed from our email list, you can unsubscribe from 
        that list as explained in each message. </p>
      <b> 
      <p>Children 13 and Under</p>
      </b> 
      <p>In any section of the site that requests personal information, visitors 
        13 years of age and under are reminded to obtain permission from an adult 
        before supplying the requested information. In addition, Audubon does 
        not actively advertise products in any section of the site intended specifically 
        for children (such as "WatchList for Kids").</p>
