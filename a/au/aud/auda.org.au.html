We are committed to complying with these laws including in particular the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which are set out in the Act and regulate how we must handle your personal information.</p><h2>What is personal information?</h2><p>The Act provides for the protection of “personal information” which is information or an opinion, whether true or not and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual who is either identified or reasonably identifiable. When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.&nbsp; If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p><h2>What personal information do we collect and hold?</h2><p>The types of personal information we may collect about you include:</p><ul><li>name;</li>

<li>we are required or authorised by or under law (including applicable privacy legislation) to do so.</li>
</ul><p>For example, we may collect information about whether the directors, officers or relevant staff of a registry operator appointment or registrar accreditation have been convicted of a criminal offence.</p><h2>How auDA Collects Personal Information</h2><p>We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.&nbsp; When collecting personal information from you, we may collect it in various ways including:</p><ul><li>when you complete your Associate Membership application;</li>
