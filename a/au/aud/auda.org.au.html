<h1 class="pagetitle">Privacy Policy (2010-02)</h1>

<p><a href="/document.php?documentid=1172">PDF version</a>  <br></p><p><strong>Policy No: 2010-02 <br></strong> Publication Date: 25/06/2010 <br> Status:    Current  </p>   <p>   1. BACKGROUND  </p>   <p>    1.1 This document sets out auDA's privacy policy, drafted in response  to the <em> Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000</em> to codify  auDA's commitment    to the responsible collection and use of personal  information by auDA.  </p>   <p>   1.2 auDA strongly advocates the  protection of all personal information, and    believes that the  adoption and implementation of this policy represents good    business  practice. auDA's commitment to this policy ensures that individuals     are made aware of:  </p>   <p>   a) when information about them is being  collected;  </p>   <p>   b) the purpose for which it is being  collected;  </p>   <p>   c) whether the information may be passed on to  third parties; and  </p>   <p>   d) the rights of individuals to have  some control over the way any    information about them is handled and  maintained.  </p>   <p>   1.3 This policy has been drafted to adhere to  the National Privacy    Principles outlined in the Privacy Act. More  information about the Act is    available on the Australian Privacy  Commissionerâ€™s web site at    http://www.privacy.gov.au or on the  Privacy Hotline number 1300 363 992.  </p>   <p>   1.4 This policy  applies only to the collection and use of personal    information by  auDA. It does not apply to the collection and use of personal     information by members of the <dfn title="internet address, eg, www.yourbusinessname.com.au">domain name</dfn> industry operating within the  .au    domain. Under auDA's Registry Licence Agreement and Registrar  Agreement,    <dfn title="The database of domain names registered in each 2LD. For more information go to (http://www.auda.org.au/registry/)">registry</dfn>  operators and <dfn title="auDA-accredited companies who handle domain name licence applications and renewals. The list of auDA-accredited registrars can be found at (http://www.auda.org.au/registrars/)">registrar</dfn>s  are required to develop their own privacy    policy in accordance with  the requirements of the Privacy Act.  </p>   <p>   2. COLLECTION OF  PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   2.1 The personal information held by  auDA is collected for the purpose of    meeting its objectives as the  manager of the .au domain, and providing the    services necessary for  meeting those objectives.  </p>   <p>   2.2 In the course of managing  the .au domain, auDA may collect personal    information in order to:  </p>    <p>   a) appoint and license registry operators;  </p>   <p>   b)  accredit and license registrars;  </p><p>c) process applications for community geographic domain names (CGDNs); <br></p>   <p>d) field and deal with  consumer enquiries and complaints;  </p>   <p>   e) refer persons to  appropriate bodies according to the nature of the    person's inquiry;  and  </p>   <p>   f) canvas stakeholders for their views, opinions and  suggestions in relation    to the .au domain.  </p>   <p>   2.3 auDA  limits the collection of personal information to that which is     required to perform the functions listed above. auDA may also collect     personal information in order to process applications for membership  of, or    employment with, auDA.  </p>   <p>   2.4 auDA does not require  or collect personal information which would be    considered  "sensitive" under the Act.  </p>   <p>   2.5 auDA's web site does not  utilise "cookies" or other technology to collect    user information or  track usage. auDA's web site may feature links to other    web sites.  auDA is not responsible for the content and privacy practices of     other such web sites.  </p>   <p>   3. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>    <p>   3.1 The way in which auDA uses personal information is dictated  by the    purpose for which the information was collected. As most  information is    collected directly from the relevant individual, that  individual will    normally be aware of the purpose of the collection.  </p>    <p>   3.2 auDA will only use personal information for a purpose other  than the    primary purpose (ie. a secondary purpose) where:  </p>   <p>    a) that individual has consented;  </p>   <p>   b) the secondary  purpose is directly related to the primary purpose and the    individual  would reasonably expect auDA to use or disclose the information    in  such a way; or  </p>   <p>   c) we are permitted or required by law, or  it is in the interests of public    safety to do so.  </p>   <p>   3.3  People who subscribe to one of auDA's mailing lists (such as the auDA     Announcements List) may decide at any time to unsubscribe from the  list.    Instructions for unsubscribing will appear in the footer of all  list emails,    as well as on the auDA web site.  </p>   <p>   4.  PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   4.1 Access to personal  information held by auDA is limited to those    employees who  specifically require it to carry out their work    responsibilities.  This extends to protecting personal information from    misuse and loss,  as well as from modification and disclosure.  </p>   <p>   4.2  Commercially sensitive information (for example, information provided by     a prospective registrar for the purpose of accreditation) will held  by auDA    staff and will not be disclosed to any director of the auDA  Board.  </p>   <p>   4.3 All personal information will only be retained  for a reasonable period    of time. auDA endeavours to maintain the  security and integrity of all    facilities by which personal  information is stored.  </p>   <p>   5. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>    <p>   5.1 auDA is committed to processing personal information  promptly and    accurately. As part of this commitment, individuals who  have provided    personal information to auDA may request access to  their information in    order to verify that it is accurate, complete  and up-to-date.  </p>   <p>   5.2 Requests for access or correction to  personal information should be    directed to auDA's Chief Policy  Officer. auDA reserves the right to refuse a    request if it is  vexatious or frivolous, or if we are legally entitled to do    so.  </p>    <p>   6. REVIEW OF POLICY  </p>   <p>   6.1 auDA reserves the right  to revise this policy at any time and those    people who volunteer  their personal details to auDA are deemed to    acknowledge and be bound  by this policy and any changes made to it. This is    no way affects  the protection afforded under the relevant laws, according to    which  this policy was developed. </p><p class="lastupdated">Last Updated: 25/06/2010 13:08</p>	</div><!-- end #midsection-->
