We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way. We have reduced to the minimum possible, instances in which personal information is collected from users.
                                                                           <br><br>

In order to utilize some of our web site features, users must first complete a registration form. During registration, the user is required to give certain contact information (such as an e-mail address). Many fields on our registration form are optional (like adding a picture to a Tutor's profile page), but many users will find that being as comprehensive as possible has its advantages. However, there is absolutely no obligation to fill out more than the required fields.
                                                                           <br><br>

Collecting such feedback information from our users is critical in ensuring the best possible performance. Participating in our surveys is optional but always appreciate your help.
                                                                           <br><br>

All communications to users, such as a newsletter, will be on an "opt-in" basis, meaning that the user must have given prior consent to receive such email newsletter or other communications.
