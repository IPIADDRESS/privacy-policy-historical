<h2>Below is the drawn out version, to make the lawyers happy:</h2>
<p>The AudioBoo site, http://audioboo.fm, (“Site”) is owned and operated by Best Before Media Limited. (“Best Before Media”).</p>
<p>Best Before Media is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust with respect to the information we collect from you. This privacy policy sets forth the information we collect about you, how we use this information, and the choices you have about how we use such information. Your use of the Site and our use of the personal information you provide to us is subject to the terms of this privacy policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<h3>Collection of Information Through Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>This Site collects information regarding your use of the Site through the use of cookies. Cookies are anonymous, unique alphanumeric identifiers sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer. The type of information we collect as a result of a cookie being stored on your computer includes the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; click stream data, including date and time, cookie number and content you viewed or searched for on the Site.<br>
We collect and use and may from time to time supply third parties with, non-personally identifiable information as anonymous, aggregated user data for the purposes of site usage analysis, quality control and improving the Site.<br>
We use temporary “session” cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to browse from page to page. Session cookies are temporary and disappear after you close your browser. We use “persistent” cookies to give you a more personalized browsing experience and to help you navigate the Site more efficiently. Persistent cookies remain after you close your browser and may be used by your browser during subsequent visits to the Site. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information except with your explicit permission. You can prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether by accessing your browser’s preferences menu. If you choose to disable cookies altogether, you can use the Site but some features of the Site may not function properly.</p>
<h3>Log File Information</h3>
<p>When you use the Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of our Terms of Use.</p>
<h3>Collection and Registration of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We sometimes request users of the Site to provide personally identifiable information. For example, in order to become a registered user of the Site, you will be required to submit certain personally identifiable information. The information collected from you is strictly voluntary. You may decline to submit personally identifiable information, in which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. The type of information collected during the registration process may include your contact information, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number and country of residence (“Registration Information”). The Registration Information is linked directly to a personal User Name and Password chosen by you and can only be retrieved by supplying the correct User Name and Password that is linked to that profile. You may choose to provide optional profile information such as your real name, photo, date of birth, profile description, tags, location and other information which may be collected and displayed on your public profile. It is your choice to post content (for example, notes or photos) and make it publicly available. You are solely responsible for the content you post. It is also your choice to reveal your location and make it publicly available. You are solely responsible for managing your location information and privacy modes.</p>
<h3>How Personal Information Is Used</h3>
<p>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Site, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide customized features and functionality.<br>
Any personal information or other content that you voluntarily disclose online (for example, on your public profile, in posts, comments, or notes) becomes publicly available and could be collected and used by others. Your account User Name is displayed to other users when you post, send direct messages, or comment. Any post made in public mode or comment that you submit to the Site may be redistributed through the Internet and other media, and could be viewed by the general public.<br>
We do not use your email address, phone number, or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site changes or for customer service purposes).<br>
We use certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, and user location) to improve the quality and design of the Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.<br>
We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors or pages viewed; and (e) track your posts, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</p>
<h3>Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members</h3>
<p>Registered users can invite friends to become registered users by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. We store the email addresses that registered users provide so that we may keep track of how many people are being invited. We do not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides the invitations. Recipients of invitations may contact us to request the removal of their information from our database.</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>Access to your personal information is restricted to use by Best Before Media, and entities acting as our agents, representatives, or partners. We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, and user location) with interested third-parties to assist with understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality for the Site.<br>
We will not otherwise disclose any personal information without your consent except: in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; and if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, violation of our policies, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<h3>Access and Changes to Your Registration Information and Preferences</h3>
<p>You may update or correct your personal information and email preferences at any time by visiting the Account Settings page. The accuracy of such information is solely your responsibility.<br>
To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting for registered users, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from the Site. We may also compare our registered user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our registered users.</p>
<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We retain the personal information we collect from you for as long as the information is relevant to our business purposes or until you request that we remove the data by contacting Best Before Media using the contact information provided below.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment to Data Security</h3>
<p>We recognize that your privacy is important to you, and therefore we endeavor to keep your personal information confidential. For example, to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique Password) to verify your identity before granting access to a user’s account or making changes to a user’s account information. However, we do not represent, warrant, or guarantee that your personal information will be protected against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alterations, and do not accept any liability for the security of the personal information submitted to us nor for your or third parties’ use or misuse of personal information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique Password and account information at all times.</p>
<h3>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of minors is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Site from persons under 18 years of age, and no part of our Site is directed to persons under 18. If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons under 18 years of age has been collected on the Site without verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete such information.</p>
<h3>Special Note to International Users</h3>
<p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the Site from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws and regulations, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by United States law, this privacy policy, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer and to the use of such information in accordance with United States law.</p>
<h3>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>In the event that Best Before Media is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<h3>About This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The foregoing is the current privacy policy of the Site. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time without notice. Any changes to this policy will be posted on this webpage. Please revisit this webpage to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of our privacy policy as then in effect. If you do not accept the terms of this privacy policy, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Site. Our policy does not create a contract or any legal rights.<br>
This Site may contain links to other websites that are beyond our control. Other websites to which you link may contain privacy policies that are different from this privacy policy. We encourage you to check the privacy policy of each website you visit before submitting any information to them.</p>
<h3>Questions, Complaints, and Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this privacy policy or if at any time you believe that we have not adhered to this privacy policy or you have a complaint regarding the way your personal information is being handled, please contact Best Before Media using the contact information provided below. We will use reasonable efforts to promptly investigate and, if necessary, to correct any problem.</p>
