We also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.</p><p>Any information shared (including Personally Identifiable Information and your personal health information (“Personal Health Information”) that you reveal in a discussion forum, message board, “Ask The Expert” posting, or online classroom discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personally Identifiable Information, health, or similar information in any public forum. This includes online course evaluations and comments. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.</p><p class="strong pt20">Profile Information – Professional Network</p><p>We collect user information when you fill out a profile. A complete profile includes professional information such as: job title, education, qualification, skills, license information, etc. This helps site members, corporate partners, recruiters, and other professional entities connect with one another.</p><p>After you create a profile or apply for a job, you may choose to provide additional information in your profile, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, group memberships, and other information including hobbies and interests. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from our Career Services by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters and business opportunities find you.</p><p>You can choose what personal information you provide in addition to the information required for registration (name, email, education and work experience).

We may use and share information you provide in a profile in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. You may change your privacy settings at any time to not display certain information such as contact information or displaying your profile to the public. You may turn off your profile at any time so that it is not displayed publicly by selecting the proper account settings. By applying for a job or actively seeking a job within the website, you are making your profile information visible to recruiters and other professionals. This information may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.</p><p class="strong pt20">User Communications – CareerMail</p><p>With certain communications you send within our site, the recipient can see your name, email address, and/or profile information depending on your privacy settings.</p><p>Many communications that you initiate through our site will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your professional network). Other communications that you initiate through the site, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Once you have connected with an individual, regardless of who sent the invitation, your profile information will be shared with that individual.</p><p class="strong pt20">Talent Recruiting, Professional Opportunities, and Marketing</p><p>We offer a career partner service to recruiters and other professionals, which can be used to search for, organize, and communicate with potential job candidates or offer business opportunities. In some cases we allow the export of public profile information.</p><p>We offer customized people-search functionality along with organizational and communications tools (including activity alerts) as part of our talent recruiting, marketing and professional opportunities. These services allow subscribers to access limited information from members’ public profiles, such as name, headline, current company, current title, and location, in order to effectively manage candidate sourcing. You may limit or prevent such subscribers from accessing your profile information by configuring your public profile visibility settings to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to these subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to them and others. A recruiter or other such subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our services, such as a resume, in connection with our platform. Any personal information obtained independently of our site will not be added by us to your profile and is not under our control but is subject to the policies of our recruiting, marketing or professional subscriber. We store such information on behalf of such subscriber who can remove it at any time. We do not further process such information.</p><p class="strong pt20">Market Research</p><p>From time to time the AudiologyOnline market research department, or its operations contractors acting on its behalf, conducts online research surveys in order to gather feedback about our Site, our Corporate Partners and opinions on important healthcare issues, through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups.</p><p>When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit Personally Identifiable Information. This Personally Identifiable Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor in a way that does not specifically and individually identify your Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information collected through market research will only be used by AudiologyOnline and its operations contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent.</p><p>In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to connect survey data with AudiologyOnline site usage characteristics. You will be notified when we would like to use cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these cookies.</p><p><a name="information-collected"></a></p><h2 class="pt20">Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on AudiologyOnline's Behalf</h2><p>Corporate Partners or advertisers on AudiologyOnline may use their own cookies in the banner advertisements served on AudiologyOnline and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than AudiologyOnline to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies (“Ad Servers”) may also collect non-Personally Identifiable Information through the use of cookies on our Site. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the Corporate Partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its proper destination (e.g., back to AudiologyOnline to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p><p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-Personally Identifiable Information they gather through them. However, we do require Corporate Partners, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie information through our Site to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our Site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-Personally Identifiable Information collected by them through cookies in advertising banners on our Site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site. This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies.</p><p><a name="children"></a></p><h2 class="pt20">Children Under the Age of 13</h2><p>Our Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age.

These continuing education course links may be found in advertisements, referenced within content, or placed beside the names or logos of Corporate Partners.
