		<h2>About This Privacy Policy and Using Our Site and Tools</h2><p>This Privacy Policy applies to the AudiologyOnline website (the “Site”). &nbsp;&nbsp;Except as specifically provided herein, this Privacy Policy is subject to change without notice. Please read it each time you visit the Site.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, you may not access and use the Site.&nbsp; Use of the Site signifies your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We will inform you through this Privacy Policy if a material change to the Privacy Policy is made that involves the use of your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined herein). Your continued use of the AudiologyOnline Site will indicate acceptance of the changes.</p><p>AudiologyOnline is a website owned and operated by AudiologyOnline, Inc. (“AudiologyOnline", “we”, “our” or “us”).&nbsp; You can reach us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:webmaster@AudiologyOnline">webmaster@AudiologyOnline</a>, or at AudiologyOnline, 19141 Stone Oak Parkway Suite #104 San Antonio, TX 78258.&nbsp; AudiologyOnline respects your privacy and has written this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of the information AudiologyOnline collects from you and how the information is used.</p><p>Use of the Site is governed by the laws of the United States.&nbsp; When you provide us with information, you acknowledge that the information will be stored and processed on servers located in the United States.&nbsp; No one under the age of 13 may use the Site.&nbsp; If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please have your parents review this Privacy Policy with you.</p><p>The Site links to other sites. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service, or content link), be aware that AudiologyOnline is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website you visit through a link or advertisement on AudiologyOnline.</p><p>While you may use much of AudiologyOnline without registration, some of the specific tools and services on our Site require registration. If you use our Site without registering, the only information we collect will be non-Personally Identifiable Information through the use of cookies as described in “Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect About You” below. If you choose to register with our Site for educational courses or other services, we require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information, as described in “Identifiable Information We Collect About You” below. “Personally Identifiable Information” means information that identifies a person, such as the person’s full name, home address, email address, telephone number, credit card information or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact you.&nbsp; You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to AudiologyOnline. Inaccurate information will affect the information you receive when using our Site and tools and our ability to contact you as contemplated in this Privacy Policy. For example, your email address should be kept current because that it is how we communicate with you.</p><h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect About You</h2><p>Even if you do not register with AudiologyOnline, we collect non-Personally Identifiable Information about your use of our Site, special promotions and newsletters.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>We collect non-Personally Identifiable Information about your use of our Site and your use of the websites of selected corporate partners (“Corporate Partners”) and advertisers through the use of cookies. &nbsp;&nbsp;A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Every computer is assigned a different cookie by AudiologyOnline. The information collected by cookies (i) helps us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages or in newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Site and selected corporate partners' and advertisers' sites, (iii) how many people open our emails, and (iv) for what purposes these actions are being taken. We may use cookie information to target certain advertisements to your browser or to determine the popularity of certain content or advertisements. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aides and as session timers.</p><p>Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, certain functions and conveniences of our Site may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to productively use our Site. We do not link non-Personally Identifiable Information from cookies to Personally Identifiable Information without your permission.</p><h2>Personally&nbsp;Identifiable Information We Collect About You</h2><p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you register as a member of AudiologyOnline and/or when you update your member profile. We use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific services you select, send you emails about Site maintenance and updates, and inform you of significant changes to this Privacy Policy as described herein.</p><h3>Newsletters &amp; Emails to You</h3><p>At registration and at various times as you use AudiologyOnline, you will be given the option of receiving recurring informational/promotional newsletters via email from AudiologyOnline and/or directly from third parties. At the time you sign up for our email newsletters or any time thereafter, you can choose to opt-out of receiving additional promotional emails from AudiologyOnline.</p><p>In order to subscribe to such newsletters via email, we need your contact information, such as name and email address. You can unsubscribe from the newsletters by simply clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email newsletter. An email to our automated unsubscribe service will be created on your computer. Click the "send" button. You will then be unsubscribed from that newsletter within two to three business days. You may also unsubscribe or change any of your email preferences by clicking on the applicable links in your email newsletter or by changing your profile within AudiologyOnline. If you are experiencing difficulties with our automated unsubscribe service, you can email AudiologyOnline Customer Service at webmaster@AudiologyOnline. AudiologyOnline Customer Service will unsubscribe you from that newsletter in two to three business days.</p><p>In some cases, when you click on a link or an advertisement in an e-mail or newsletter, your browser may be momentarily directed to the website of a third party which, acting on behalf of AudiologyOnline (see “Disclosure to Website Service and Content Contractors”, below), notes or "counts" your response to the e-mail or newsletter before re-directing your browser to its proper destination; this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p><p>When you use AudiologyOnline's "Email a Friend" function, AudiologyOnline emails the article or other content you designate to your friend's email address and lists your email address as the sender. AudiologyOnline uses the friend's email address only for the purpose of sending your friend the email you requested. While we store both email addresses, we do not use them for any other purpose unless disclosed to you at the time you send the email.</p><h3>Emails You Send to AudiologyOnline</h3><p>This Privacy Policy does not protect you when you send content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions to AudiologyOnline by email. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to AudiologyOnline. We try to answer every email within 48 business hours, but are not always able to do so.</p><h3>Chat Rooms and other Public Forums</h3><p>As a service to our users, AudiologyOnline features chat rooms and other public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where users can post questions for experts to answer. We also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.</p><p>Any information shared (including Personally Identifiable Information and your personal health information (“Personal Health Information”)) that you reveal in a chat room, message board, "Ask The Expert" posting or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personally Identifiable Information or Personal Health Information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.</p><h3>Market Research</h3><p>From time to time the AudiologyOnline market research department, or its operations contractors acting on its behalf, conducts online research surveys in order to gather feedback about our Site, our Corporate Partners and opinions on important healthcare issues, through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups.</p><p>When participating in a survey, we may ask you to submit Personally Identifiable Information. This Personally Identifiable Information is used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a survey is sponsored by a third party, aggregate information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor in a way that does not specifically and individually identify your Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information collected through market research will only be used by AudiologyOnline and its operations contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent.</p><p>In addition to collecting survey responses from our members, cookies may be used to authenticate respondents or to help you pick up where you left off in a survey. If you have cookies disabled you may not be able to participate in some studies. Cookies may be used to connect survey data with AudiologyOnline site usage characteristics. You will be notified when we would like to use cookies in this way and your consent will be requested for these cookies.</p><h3>Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on AudiologyOnline's Behalf</h3><p>Corporate Partners or advertisers on AudiologyOnline may use their own cookies in the banner advertisements served on AudiologyOnline and in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Some advertisers use companies other than AudiologyOnline to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect non-Personally Identifiable Information through the use of cookies on our Site. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the Corporate Partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its proper destination (e.g., back to AudiologyOnline to show the ad, or to the advertiser's website); this re-direction process will not be apparent to you.</p><p>We do not control these third parties' use of cookies, or how they manage the non-Personally Identifiable Information they gather through them. However, we do require Corporate Partners, advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie information through our Site to agree that they will not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from our Site without your consent. They have promised us they will not link any non-Personally Identifiable Information collected by them through cookies in advertising banners on our Site to Personally Identifiable Information they or others collect. Certain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies. In order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site. Currently, you can opt-out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site. This website will also allow you to review the Ad Server's privacy policies.</p><h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2><p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, AudiologyOnline will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information it gathers from you on our Site. We will only release Personally Identifiable Information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others; or (3) to comply with arrangements made with our corporate partners as it relates to both live and pre-recorded e-learning courses.
