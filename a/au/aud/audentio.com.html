<p>Audentio Design of Audentio.com operates this web site. Audentio Design regards the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the service that we offer to our users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration Data</strong> - We use Registration Data to give you access to our forums and purchase script.

Audentio Design will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.</p>

No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners period! Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.
