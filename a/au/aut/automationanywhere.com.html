<p class="privacy-bold">Advertising and Newsletters</p>

<p>We may from time to time allow certain third parties to display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites.

You may not opt-out of service-related communications, which are not promotional in nature.

<p class="privacy-bold">Your Rights</p>

<p>Upon an individual’s request, Automation Anywhere will provide reasonable access to any personal information it has about that person. Automation Anywhere will also take reasonable steps to allow such individuals to correct, change, modify or delete any such information that is shown to be incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete. You may ask us to delete the personal information we hold about you, or cease processing such personal information, in certain circumstances. It may not be possible for us to delete or cease processing all of the information we hold about you where we have an ongoing relationship with you or where we have a legal basis to retain such personal information.</p>

<p>You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@automationanywhere.com">privacy@automationanywhere.com</a>. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p class="privacy-bold">Tracking</p>

<p>We do not track users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.

<p>However, some of our service providers and advertisers may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Sites and may combine the information in these cookies with any personal information about you that they may have. The use of such tracking information by a third party is subject to its privacy policy.</p>

<p class="privacy-bold">EU – U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks</p>

<p>Automation Anywhere participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (each, a “Framework” and collectively, the “Frameworks”).

To learn more about the Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov.</p>

<p>Automation Anywhere is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Automation Anywhere complies with the Privacy Shield Principles set forth in the Frameworks for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Frameworks, Automation Anywhere is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>In certain situations, Automation Anywhere may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request" target="_blank" title="">https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>.</p>
