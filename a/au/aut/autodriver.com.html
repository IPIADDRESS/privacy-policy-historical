<h1> Autodriver.com - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>In accordance with federal regulations, Adaroo.com LLC is giving you this notice to tell you how we may use non-public personal information you provided us in connection with a financial product or service you have obtained, or sought to obtain, from us. We call this nonpublic personal information "Private Information" and describe it below. This notice applies to your Private Information while you are our customer, as well as after our customer relationship is terminated.</p>

<p>Collection and Use of Private Information</p>

<p>We collect the following types of Private Information about you from the following sources:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Information we receive from you on applications or       other forms, such as your name, address, social security number and       income.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Disclosure of Private Information</h2>
<p>We may disclose Private Information (described above) under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) Among Affiliates<br>
There are two special categories of Private Information. One is information about your history of dealing with us, such as identification information, account history and balances and payment history (which we refer to as "Transaction Information"). The other is information received from other sources, including information typically found in a credit report (which we refer to as "Third Party Information"). We may share all Private Information that consists of Transaction Information with our affiliates. Our affiliates include a mortgage broker. We do this to provide you with the products and services we and our affiliates offer. We do not share Third Party Information with our affiliates.</p>

<p>(2) With Other Financial Service Providers<br>

When you apply to us for credit, or when a dealer forwards your credit application to us for approval, we will share all Private Information we obtain about you in that transaction with other lenders and finance companies (including motor vehicle dealers providing vehicle financing) who are necessary to our credit decision making process.</p>

<p>(3) With Service Providers and Joint Marketing Partners<br>

We may disclose all Private Information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf, including companies we engage to market our products and services for us, or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements including motor vehicle dealers providing vehicle financing.</p>

<p>(4) With Non-Affiliated Marketing Companies<br>

In order to provide you with additional product and service offerings, we may disclose all Private Information about you with trustworthy and reputable third parties such as:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Financial service providers</li>
<li>Non-financial companies</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ul>
<p>IF YOU PREFER THAT WE NOT DISCLOSE YOUR PRIVATE  INFORMATION WITH NON-AFFILIATED MARKETING COMPANIES, YOU MAY  "OPT-OUT" OF THOSE DISCLOSURES, THAT IS, YOU MAY DIRECT US NOT TO  MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES (OTHER THAN DISCLOSURES OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW).  AFTER COMPLETION OF THE APPLICATION BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO THE ADDRESS&nbsp; SHOWN ON THE CONTACT PAGE.</p>
<p>(5) With Other Third Parties<br>
<br>
We may share all Private Information about you with other non-affiliated third  parties, as permitted by law.</p>
 
 <p>Protection of Information<br>
<br>
We restrict access to Private Information about you to our employees and third  parties who need to know that information in order to manage your account.  Additionally, we take other steps to protect your Private Information in a  manner consistent with industry standards for similar sized finance companies.  We will review our safeguards from time to time, and strive to maintain them in  a manner consistent with federal regulations, if any, that may be in effect from  time to time. Our employees are trained and required to maintain our privacy  policies and procedures. Employees who violate these policies and procedures  are subject to disciplinary action.<br>
