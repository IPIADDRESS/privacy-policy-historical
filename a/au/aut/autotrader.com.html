<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names,
         email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Our website is not directed at children under
         13 and we won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information; if you're under 13,
         please don't provide any information about yourself on this website.
      </p>
   </div>
</body_copy>
<h5>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car
         for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or inquire about a vehicle listed for sale or
         about another product or service offered through our website; and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through
         our website and review our email newsletters and other email messages. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our
         website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may be gathering information, as well, through
         processes we don't control.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Searches and Listings</strong> To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests
         so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home,
         we need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your zip code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform
         a search. We use this information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you find a listing that interests you and
         elect to send the seller an email through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information you supply through
         our online "Email this Seller" form. If you find a listing for a certified pre-owned vehicle that interests you and elect
         to send the seller an email through our website, we'll also share the information you supply through our “Email this Seller”
         form with the manufacturer of the vehicle you’re inquiring about (which administers the certified pre-owned program) to use
         only for quality assurance, internal business analysis, process management, and other similar purposes. If you do not wish
         to share your email address or other contact information with a seller who advertises on our website, you should not use our
         "Email Seller" contact form. Many of the dealership listings that appear on our website include toll-free telephone numbers
         that can be used to contact the dealership that is selling the advertised vehicle. If you call a dealership using one of these
         toll-free numbers, we may provide the dealership with the date, time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from
         which your call originated. If you wish to contact a dealership that advertises on our website without disclosing this information,
         please contact the dealership by email or by dialing its local telephone number. When you list a car for sale, we ask for
         information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers. We also ask for your credit card number and the
         expiration date on your card. We use this information to create your ad and to process your payment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sweepstakes and Other Promotions</strong> From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional
         contest, we'll ask you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). Among other
         things, we'll need this information to contact you if you win, and we may also use this information for marketing purposes.
         We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes; we'll identify the co-sponsor&nbsp;in the contest
         rules. We may also share this information with shipping or fulfillment companies or other third-party service providers that
         help administer&nbsp;our promotions, such as by conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you don't want us
         to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please
         do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Online Surveys</strong> From time to time, we survey our users to measure their satisfaction with our site and other sites and to help us learn more
         about our audience and how they interact with our site.&nbsp; Third-party research firms often conduct these surveys on our behalf.&nbsp;
         We use the survey results to help us improve the services we offer to you.&nbsp; Except in the circumstances described below in
         the "Other Disclosures" section of this policy, we will not share, without your consent, any personally-identifying information
         you submit in response to an AutoTrader.com survey with any company other than the research firm conducting the survey.&nbsp; We
         will, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it on an anonymous basis with data collected from other survey
         participants.&nbsp; We may use and disclose that pool of anonymous information as we see fit, without identifying you personally.
      </p>
      <p>You may also find on our site invitations to participate surveys conducted by our advertisers, whose privacy practices we
         don't control.&nbsp; These invitations will usually link to an online survey form that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting
         the survey or by a third-party research firm working on the advertiser's behalf.&nbsp; When you access an advertiser's survey through
         our website, use and disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser's privacy policy (or by the
         privacy policy of the advertiser's research firm), which may differ from ours. If you can't find the applicable privacy policy
         via a link either from the advertiser's survey invitation or from the online survey form, you should contact the advertiser
         directly for more information.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Email Addresses</strong> If you provide us your email address, we may email you about our website or our services, or to inquire about your experience
         using our website or sites operated by others. From time to time, we'll also send you emails that may include automotive information,
         special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. Though we hope you'll find these communications
         informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions included in each email.
         And you can opt-out of receiving these types of commercial offers at all by indicating, when you list a car for sale or inquire
         about a car listed on our website, that you'd prefer not to receive these communications.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong> To help us tailor our website to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users
         by placing a cookie, a small entry in text file, on your hard drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track
         the pages you've visited. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic
         patterns. We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs of our users. We also use
         cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly during a single visit to our site. Cookies don't reveal personally
         identifying&nbsp;information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies can't
         read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and third parties that&nbsp;provide products and/or services through our
         site may also assign their own cookies, a process we don't control. The help function on most web browsers contains information
         on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept
         cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors. Our "Find
         Your Car" feature, for example, won't work properly if you configure your browser not to accept cookies.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong> To help us (and in some cases our advertisers) keep track of how many users are accessing particular pages and listings&nbsp;within
         our website, and to track how users respond to ads we place on third-party websites, we may place a small file, called a web
         beacon, on some of our pages and on some of the listings we distribute. In combination with cookies, these web beacons allow
         us (or our advertisers) to track the number of users who view particular pages and listings to fine tune the advertising messages
         delivered to users of this and other websites. We may use "clickstream" data collected using web beacons and cookies to help
         us tailor the content of promotional messages, including email messages, to the perceived interests of our users. Advertising
         networks with which we are affiliated and third-party advertising services that we use may also use web beacons on our site
         to gather similar anonymous "clickstream" information, which is used to fine tune&nbsp;advertising messages delivered to our visitors
         and visitors to other websites. (See "Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting," below, for more information
         regarding the information.)
      </p>
      <p><strong>Browser Level Information</strong> Our web server automatically collects limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our site, including
         the type of browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website
         that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the
         Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also
         use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who
         you are.) We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting</strong> AutoTrader.com works with leading third-party advertising companies, including DoubleClick, Advertising.com and Tacoda. Their
         services include targeting and serving some of the advertisements, promotions, or other marketing messages you see on the
         pages of our site and other websites. Anonymous tracking information called "clickstream" data is collected from our website
         and other websites so that DoubleClick, Advertising.com, Tacoda, AutoTrader.com, and others can use such information, sometimes
         in conjunction with similar anonymous information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements tailored to match&nbsp;the
         perceived interests of consumers. This clickstream data does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address,
         email address or telephone number, but it may include the IP address of your computer. Clickstream data is used for marketing
         research, targeting advertising, and other similar purposes. We also use DoubleClick software to serve our own ads and collect
         similar information in the process. DoubleClick, Advertising.com and Tacoda may also use cookies and/or web beacons to collect
         anonymous information directly from our users. If you would like to know more about DoubleClick's information gathering practices
         and opt-out procedures, please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">DoubleClick website</a>. To opt out of DoubleClick's ad targeting program, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookie/">click here</a>. If you would like to learn more about Advertising.com's information collection practices and opt-out procedures, please
         see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.advertising.com/privacy_policy.php">Advertising.com website</a>. For more information on Tacoda's information collection practices and opt-out procedures, please read the privacy policy
         posted on the <a href="http://www.tacoda.com">Tacoda website</a>.

<h5>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>When we present information to our advertisers-to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on
         our website--it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site. Any credit card
         information you may provide to us is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry--standard secure socket
         layer (SSL) encryption and is stored on our secure servers. (See "Security," below.) We use your credit card information only
         to bill you for the products and services you order from us. We don't share your credit card information with anyone, except
         as may be necessary to process your transactions or comply with law. We may collect, or have a third party collect on our
         behalf, aggregated statistical information about how visitors use and navigate around our site, such as the number of users
         who visit various pages within the site, what they click on, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages, fill out
         forms, etc. This aggregated information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve our site. We
         may also disclose this aggregated information to third parties.
      </p>
   </div>
</body_copy>
<h5>LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PROVIDERS</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we feature some products and services that come from other providers. Our
         finance, insurance, warranty, and inspection services, for example, are made available through cooperative arrangements with
         companies that specialize in providing such services. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary for
         them to provide the products or services. We have a strategic marketing relationship with our sister company, Cox Auto Trader,
         the publisher of Auto Trader Magazine. When you visit our site to purchase a combination print ad (in Auto Trader Magazine)
         and online ad (on AutoTrader.com), you may be redirected to a web page hosted by Cox Auto Trader to complete your transaction.
         Any information you submit on forms that appear on web pages hosted by Cox Auto Trader will be collected and used pursuant
         to Cox Auto Trader's <a href="http://traderpub.com/privacy.html ">privacy policy</a>. (You can tell which site hosts the page you're viewing by looking at the location bar at the top of your web browser. If
         it says "autotrader.com," you're on a page hosted by AutoTrader.com. If it says "traderpub.com," you're on a page hosted by
         Cox Auto Trader.) Of course, our site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered
         by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services
         or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of
         the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the
         course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy
         policy of the provider of those products or services. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find
         the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from their site's homepage or from the pages on which
         the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.

<h5>OTHER DISCLOSURES</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our
         Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, the public or AutoTrader.com.
         As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that AutoTrader.com, Inc., one of its business
         units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred
         assets. If you choose to unsubscribe in response to an email message that we send on behalf of an advertiser, we will share
         your email address and opt-out instructions with the advertiser to ensure that your email privacy preferences are honored.
         Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send its customers email offers on our behalf, we will share with that company
         (or its agent) a list of&nbsp;email addresses collected from website visitors who have opted out of our email program to ensure
         that their privacy preferences are honored.&nbsp;We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, for
         example) and to analyze the data they find there or aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours.
         Though some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the contact information included in
         a vehicle listing), we'll only allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is otherwise publicly
         available on our website. When we use other companies to help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you,
         we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that
         these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.
