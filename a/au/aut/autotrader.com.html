<p>Effective Date: <b>December 9, 2004</b></p>
<p>AutoTrader.com, LLC respects the privacy of visitors to our website. 

Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what 

information we collect through our website and what we do with that 

information. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected 

online through the Autotrader.com website and does not describe the ways in 

which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any 

means other than our website. If you have questions about this Privacy 

Statement, please <a href="/help/email.jsp?contact_email=atc_info">contact 

Customer Service</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bold">PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</span></p>
<p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending 

any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and 

phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Our website is 

not directed at children under 13 and we won't knowingly allow anyone under 

13 to provide us any personally identifying information; if you're under 13, 

please don't provide any information about yourself on this website.</p>
<p><span class="bold">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></p>
<p>The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information 

supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car for sale, perform a 

search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or initiate a 

transaction, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate 

through our website and review our email newsletters and other email 

messages. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website, 

such as vendors of products and services offered through our site by third 

parties, may be gathering information, as well, through processes we don't 

control.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Searches and Listings</span>  To make use of certain 

features on our site, visitors need to provide limited information about 

themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we 

provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close 

to home, we need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your zip 

code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search. We 

use this information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you 

find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email 

through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information you 

supply through our online form. If you call a dealer to inquire about a car 

listed on our site, we may provide the dealer with the date, time, and 

duration of your call, as well as the number from which the call originated. 

We may provide the dealer with your phone number and a record of the date 

and time that you tried to reach the dealer, even if your attempt was 

unsuccessful. After receiving this information, the dealer may call you back 

for marketing purposes. When you list a car for sale, we ask for information 

on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers. We also ask 

for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card. We use 

this information to create your ad and to process your payment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Sweepstakes and Other Promotions</span> From time to 

time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website. If you 

enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we'll ask you to provide 

information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). 

Among other things, we'll need this information to contact you if you win, 

and we may use this information for marketing purposes. We may share this 

information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, which we'll 

identify in the contest rules. We may also share this information with 

shipping or fulfillment companies or other third-party service providers who 

are responsible for some aspects of administering our promotions, such as 

conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you don't want 

us to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes 

registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please do not enter the 

contest or sweepstakes.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Email Addresses</span> If you provide us your email address, we may email you about our website or our services, or to inquire about your experience using our website or sites operated by others.  From time to time, we'll also send you emails that may include automotive information, special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. Though we hope you'll find these communications informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions included in each email. And you can opt-out of receiving these types of commercial offers at all by indicating, when you list a car for sale or inquire about a car listed on our website, that you'd prefer not to receive these communications.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Cookies</span>  To help us tailor our website to the 

needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by 

our users by placing a cookie, a small entry in text file, on your hard 

drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track the pages 

you've visited. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by 

other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this 

information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs of 

our users. We also use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad 

repeatedly during a single visit to our site. Cookies don't reveal personal 

information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is 

information you supply yourself. Cookies can't read unrelated data off your 

hard drive. Our advertisers and those who provide products and/or services 

through our site may also assign their own cookies, a process we don't 

control. We don't have access to these cookies or to any information they 

contain. The help function on most web browsers contains information on how 

to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable 

cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to 

take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other 

visitors. Our "Find Your Car" feature, for example, won't work properly if 

you configure your browser not to accept cookies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Web Beacons</span> To help us keep 

track of how many users are visiting particular pages within our website, 

and how many users are accessing particular listings that we distribute, we 

may place a small file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on 

some of the listings we distribute.  These web beacons allow us to track the 

number of users that view our pages and our listings, but they don't reveal 

any personally identifying information about individual users.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Browser Level Information</span>  Our web server 

automatically collects limited information about your computer configuration 

when you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the 

operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, 

the website that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a 

numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to 

identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) 

can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems 

administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell 

us who you are.) We use this information to make our site as useful as we 

can for as many users as possible.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and 

Targeting</span>  AutoTrader.com uses the services of DoubleClick, a leading 

third-party advertising company. Their services include serving and 

targeting some of the advertisements, promotions, or other marketing 

messages you see on the pages of our site and other websites. Anonymous 

tracking information called "clickstream" data is collected from our website 

and other websites so that DoubleClick, AutoTrader.com, and others can use, 

sometimes in conjunction with similar anonymous information gathered through 

other websites. This data is used for marketing research, targeting 

advertising, and other similar purposes. We also use DoubleClick software to 

serve our own ads and collect similar information in the process. 

DoubleClick also uses cookies, and it collects information directly from our 

users. If you would like to know more about DoubleClick's information 

gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, please see the privacy 

statement on the <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org">DoubleClick 

website</a> (<a href="http://www.privacychoices.org">http://www.privacychoices.org</a>).  To 

opt-out of DoubleClick's ad targeting program, please <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm">click here</a> 
(http://www.privacychoices.org/optout.htm).</p>
<p><span class="bold">USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>When we present information to our advertisers-to help them understand 

our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website-it is 

usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages 

within our site. When you list your car for sale on AutoTrader.com, we may 

provide your contact information to our sister company, Trader Publishing 

Company, which may use this information to contact you about listing your 

vehicle for sale in one of its Trader magazines. Any credit card information 

you may provide to us is secured during transmission over the Internet using 

industry-standard secure socket layer (SSL) encryption and is stored on our 

secure servers. (See "Security," below.) We use your credit card information 

only to bill you for the products and services you order from us. We don't 

share your credit card information with anyone, except as may be necessary 

to process your transactions or comply with law. We may collect, or have a 

third party collect on our behalf, aggregated statistical information about 

how visitors use and navigate around our site, such as the number of users 

who visit various pages within the site, what they click on, whether they 

scroll up or down on particular pages, fill out forms, etc. This aggregated 

information does not identify you personally. We use this information to 

improve our site. We may also disclose this aggregated information to third 

parties.</p>
<p><span class="bold">LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER 

PROVIDERS</span></p>
<p>To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we feature some 

products and services that come from other providers. Our finance, 

insurance, warranty, and inspection services, for example, are made 

available through cooperative arrangements with companies that specialize in 

providing such services. We share with these third parties such information 

as is necessary for them to provide the products or services. Of course, our 

site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and 

services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. 

When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct 

other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide 

is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're 

visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide 

information in the course of obtaining products or services through our 

site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy 

policy of the provider of those products or services. The provider's privacy 

policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of 

our provider partners via a link either from their site's homepage or from 

the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact 

the provider directly for more information.</p>
<p><span class="bold">OTHER DISCLOSURES</span></p>
<p>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release 

is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to 

protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our 

customers, the public or AutoTrader.com. As our business grows, we may buy 

or sell various assets. To ensure that the email marketing preferences of 

our visitors are honored, we may share email addresses collected on our 

website with advertisers (or their designated agents) for the limited 

purpose of identifying and removing from our distribution lists and/or the 

advertiser's distribution lists the email addresses of any persons who have 

"unsubscribed" or otherwise indicated a preference not to receive commercial 

electronic mail messages from, or transmitted on behalf of, the relevant 

advertiser. In the unlikely event that AutoTrader.com LLC, one of its 

business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another 

company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. 

We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, 

for example) and to analyze the data they find there or aggregate it with 

other data, either for their business purposes, or ours. Though some of the 

information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the 

contact information included in a vehicle listing), we'll only allow 

searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is 

otherwise publicly available on our website. When we use other companies to 

help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you, we may 

provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them 

to perform their services. We require that these companies commit to use the 

information only to perform the services that we request.</p>
<p><span class="bold">SECURITY</span></p>
<p>Information we gather on our website is stored within 

AutoTrader.com-controlled databases (or databases hosted on our behalf) on 

servers maintained in protected environments. Any credit card information 

you provide us is secured for transmission over the Internet using 

industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.  (<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html">Click here to learn more 

about the SSL protocol</a>.)  However, no physical or electronic security 

system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or 

databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be 

intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, 

any information you include in a vehicle listing is available to anyone with 

Internet access.</p>
<p><span class="bold">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</span></p>
<p>The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at 

some point in the future, we'll post the changes to this Privacy Statement 

on this website and update the reference to the effective date to reflect 

the date of the amendment. By visiting AutoTrader.com, you agree that your 

visit, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Statement 

and our <a href="/visitor.jsp">Visitor Agreement</a>.</p>
