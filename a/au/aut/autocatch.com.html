					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
								
					<p>All personal information collected and used from the Autocatch.com site will be processed in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection of Canada.</p>
						
					<h2>Information Collected</h2>

					<h3>Online Advertisements</h3>
						
					<p>In order to place an advertisement on the AutoCatch.com web site, you will need to register. We will require you to supply your name, e-mail address, and postal code. Registrants are also presented with the option of supplying their mobile number, and the make and model of any cars owned. Credit Card information is not collected through the web site.</p>

					<h3>Vehicle Searches</h3>
						
					<p>In order to conduct a vehicle search on the AutoCcatch.com web site, we will require you to supply a selection of identifying criteria matching your chosen vehicle, for example make, model and price.</p>

					<h2>Use of Information</h2>

					<h3>General</h3>
						
					<p>AutoCatch.com and information supplied in this site may be shared with other group companies. When you register with our site, we ask you whether you would like to receive our email newsletters detailing changes to the site, offers and services from third party companies via email and/or via post that we feel may be of interest to you. You have the ability to opt-out of receiving all or any of these offers during registration.</p>
					<p>We have taken measures to ensure that information supplied to us is held securely. As a consequence - we may occasionally request proof of identity before allowing access to your personal information.</p>
					<p>You have the right to access all personal information supplied to Autocatch.com and rectify any inaccuracies on the information held (a charge of $75 may be administered). Further enquiries should be made to info@autocatch.com.</p>
					<p>If you wish to access your personal details as held by AutoCatch.com, a charge of $75 will be made.</p>
					<p>Amendments and Updates to this policy may be made from time to time. Any revisions will be posted on this page so you will always be aware of what information we collect.</p>

					<h3>Online Advertisements</h3>
					
					<p>Telephone numbers and email addresses supplied as part of a vehicle advertisement will be published within the relevant advertisement for the duration of the booking, to enable a potential buyer to contact the seller. The postal code (if applicable) is collected in order to provide a positioning on each vehicle within our database, thereby enabling potential buyers to locate vehicles for sale within a set radius of their chosen location.</p>
						
					<h3>Vehicle Searches</h3>
						
					<p>Postcodes and vehicle information are collected in order to provide a relevant match of vehicles against a specified search. The inclusion of the postcode enables us to provide the potential buyer with a range of vehicles within a chosen locality, rather than vehicles randomly spread throughout the country.</p>

					<h3>Registration</h3>
						
					<p>Email addresses are collected in order to send registrants their chosen password, providing them with online access to their registration details. The user can access this information at any time in order to update their details or change the option on whether they would like to receive communication from AutoCatch.com or selected third parties. Other registration information is collected in order:</p>
					<p>To generate an overall audience profile of visitors using the AutoCatch.com web site. This information is then used to assist in developing relevant content on the site as well as ensuring that automotive trade advertisers looking to reach specific audience groups are encouraged to place their stock or promotions on the site.</p>
					<p>To provide our web site visitors with the option to receive the AutoCatch.com monthly email newsletter, as well as the option to receive email and postal offers from selected third party companies that AutoCatch.com believes may be of interest to them. If a visitor has supplied insurance renewal date information and/or vehicle ownership details, it provides AutoCatch.com with the potential to better target that visitor with relevant and timely consumer offers by email or post, providing that visitor has opted to receive notification on such offers.</p>
					<p>To support our E-alerts functionality - whereby visitors to our site can store settings on vehicle searches and/or set up alerts to be notified (by email) - when a specified vehicle appears for sale on the AutoCatch.com web site. Unless a visitor supplies their email address, we are unable to send such alerts.</p>
					<p>To limit access to the full range of fields within the search form in order to maintain an overall faster search facility. By providing limited access to all our search fields, notably free text entry boxes, we are able to limit the impact on the performance of our search engine during periods of intense user activity. Whilst all users gain unhindered access to the key database fields, (such as Make and Model) fields that generate more intensive database processing (such as free text fields), are limited to those users who register.</p>
						
					<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

					<p>When you visit our web site we issue a "cookie" or unique identification code that enables us to recognise your computer and store settings to help facilitate your use of our site.</p>
					<p>If your computer is configured to accept cookies we will be able to provide time saving functionality such as:</p>

					<div class="browse_general_list">
						<ul>
							<li><span>To maintain your preset location of choice</span></li>
							<li><span>If your computer is cookie enabled we are also able to limit the number of occasions you are exposed to certain display advertisements on our site (such as banners and pop-up boxes). On most occasions this will mean you never see the same pop-up advertisement more than twice each time you visit the AutoCatch.com web site.</span></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
						
					<p style="margin-top:20px;">Please note you need to enable cookies in your browser in order to place an advert. For further information on cookies or for details on how to delete them or refuse their installation on your computer, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org/</p>
						
					<p>AutoCatch.com uses cookies for 4 purposes:</p>

					<div class="browse_general_list">
						<ul>
							<li><span>To enable the delivery of functionality that improves the ease and speed of using the Autocatch.com web site.</span></li>
							<li><span>To frequency cap display advertisements, particularly pop-up boxes. By limiting advertisement exposure we provide a more compelling user experience for site visitors and also ensure that advertisements on AutoCatch.com are more evenly spread across our user base.</span></li>
							<li><span>To enable us to track the relative demand for different types of vehicles on the site. Such information enables us to better target advertising at users searching for specific vehicles.</span></li>
							<li><span>To enable us to track the relative popularity of disparate parts of our site. This in turn enables us to concentrate our efforts on developing those parts of the site that are generating the greatest consumer demand.</span></li>
