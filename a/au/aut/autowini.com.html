                        <p>AutoWini.com may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, the public or AutoWini.com. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. Furthermore, information on our visitors would be the transferred assets. If you choose to unsubscribe in response to an email message that we send on behalf of an advertiser, we will share your email address and opt-out instructions with the advertiser to ensure that your email privacy preferences are honored. Similarly, if we ask a third-party company to send its customers email offers on our behalf, we will share with that company (or its agent) a list of email addresses collected from website visitors who have opted out of our email program to ensure that their privacy preferences are honored. We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, for example) and to analyze the data they find there or aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours. Though some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the contact information included in an item listing), we'll only allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is otherwise publicly available on our website. When we use other companies to help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services. AutoWini.com requires that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.</p>

                        <p>Information we gather on our website is stored within AutoWini.com-controlled databases (or databases hosted on our behalf) on servers maintained in protected environments. Also, our servers are located in Seoul, South Korea. Autowini.com treats every data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools(encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect users' personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in an item listing is available to anyone with Internet access. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect our users' privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
