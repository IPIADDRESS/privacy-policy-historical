      <p>At AutoBarn.com, we ensure that it's safe by transferring all of your
      personal information, including your name, address and credit card, over a
      Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your information is
      encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet.
      The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. You will know you're
      in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon, located at the bottom of your
      browser, appears as "locked." You also can verify you are in
      secure mode by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a
      secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from
      "http" to "https." After the information reaches
      AutoBarn.com, it is stored on a secure server, which means it resides
      behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. At that
      point, your information can only be accessed by employees to process your
      orders. All such employees sign a privacy/security policy, which provides
      legal confidentiality protection for our customers. Violations of this
      policy results in disciplinary actions, including the possibility of
      termination, criminal prosecution and civil action.<br>
