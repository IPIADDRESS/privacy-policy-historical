                        <p>
                            Like most web sites, authorSTREAM uses cookies and web log files to track site usage.
                            A cookie is a tiny data file saved on your computer to allow authorSTREAM to recognize
                            you as a user whenever you return to our site using the same computer and web browser.
                            Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies you will not be able
                            to use our website. Like the information that you enter at registration or in your
                            profile, in the cookie and in the log file data is used to customize your experience
                            on the web site.<br>
                            One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you
                            have logged in to your authorSTREAM account. The next time you visit the authorSTREAM
                            web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user
                            and thus you need not log in to use the service. In order to access or change any
                            of your private information (like a credit card number), you must log in with your
                            password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Additionally, if
                            you log out of the authorSTREAM site in any of your visits you will be prompted
                            to input your password to log in to your authorSTREAM account. Another type of cookie,
                            called a “session” cookie, is used to identify your particular visit
                            to the authorSTREAM site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you
                            close your web browser.<br>
                            Complying with the communication standards on the Internet, we automatically receive
                            the URLs of the sites you previously surfed and moved on while your visit to authorSTREAM
                            site. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the
                            proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system
                            and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information
                            is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the authorSTREAM service. The
                            linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is
                            never shared with third-parties without your permission or except when required
                            by law.</p>

                            guardians and we always suggest minors (under the age of 18) not to submit any personal
                            information to us or use the service. authorSTREAM does not knowingly collect or
                            maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information
                            on the authorSTREAM Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our
                            website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then
                            please do not use or access the authorSTREAM Sites at any time or in any manner.
                            If authorSTREAM learns that personally identifiable information of persons less
                            than 13 years of age has been collected on the authorSTREAM Sites without verified
                            parental consent, then authorSTREAM will take the appropriate steps to delete this
                            information.</p>
