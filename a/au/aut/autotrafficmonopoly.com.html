<p>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see
explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how our Web site is
used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</p>

<p>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing
the products and services you requested, to process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our

<p>What Are Cookies?<br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web
site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive
specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it
has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.
However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse
cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not
function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or
pass on computer viruses.</p>

<p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br>
As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases,
we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in
conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web
site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site
and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not
intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>

<p>IP Addresses<br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number
that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our
web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you
request) can be sent to you.</p>

We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email
addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide
services that you have requested.</p>

database by emailing us at the usual address.</p>

<p>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?<br>
We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that
the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</p>

longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on
our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before
proceeding.</p>

Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>

<p>Our Commitment To Data Security:</p>

<p>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws
on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or
citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we
have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
information we collect online.</p>

considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>

<p>Privacy Policy Modifications</p>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will
email users who have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back
periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the

with this Privacy Policy, without your prior consent.</p>
