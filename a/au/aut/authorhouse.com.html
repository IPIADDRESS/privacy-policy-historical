								Privacy Policy
							
						</h1>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						
							<p>Privacy is one of the hottest issues today, on or off the Internet. <strong>AuthorHouseâ„¢</strong> is aware of these concerns and wants you to feel as comfortable shopping at our site as you do at your local bookstore. Our privacy policy, as detailed below, answers questions you may have about access, security, and control of personal information. It also describes how the information will be used and whether it will be provided to third parties. </p>
<p>AuthorHouse believes that your personal information -- including your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, and credit card data -- belongs to you. While we collect this type of information when you provide it to us, we do not rent or sell it to third parties. We use it only to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. </p>
<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission has created a website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/webredy.htm">How to Be Web Ready</a>, which provides general tips on how to protect your privacy online. The FTC has also created another website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm">Site Seeing on the Internet</a>, which provides general tips about navigating the Internet. Both websites are filled with information about how to use the Internet wisely, how to avoid fraud and deception online, and how to keep personal information private. </p>
<p>WHAT INFORMATION DOES AUTHORHOUSE COLLECT? <br>When users visit the AuthorHouse website, there are two types of information that may be collected. </p>
<p>The first type of information is known as "personally identifiable information" and can only be collected when an order is placed. This information includes your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, and credit card data. This information allows us to process and fulfill your order as well as to notify you of your order status. AuthorHouse has never, and will never, share this information with a third-party vendor. </p>
<p>AuthorHouse may use your email address to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you can change the preferences by clicking <a href="http://newsletter.1stbooks.com/">HERE</a>. </p>
<p>AuthorHouse may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with law, (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of AuthorHouse, our users, or others. </p>
<p>The second type of information is known as "non-personally identifiable information" and is collected upon each visit to our website. Our server automatically recognizes visitors' domain names and Internet Protocol addresses (where possible). We also collect information about how visitors use the site. This information, which is collected and maintained in an anonymous, non-personal and composite form, allows us to improve the content of our website and facilitate market research. </p>
<p>DOES AUTHORHOUSE USE NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? <br>On occasion, we may provide non-personally identifiable information about our users, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors to help us understand this information better. However, these statistics will not include any personally identifiable information. Other than improving our website and providing our visitors with the best experience possible, we make no other use of this information. </p>
<p>HOW DOES AUTHORHOUSE PROTECT USER INFORMATION? <br>AuthorHouse uses the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All of your ordering information -- including your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, and credit card data -- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security. </p>
<p>Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution called <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>, the world's recognized leader in e-commerce payment solutions. They receive the credit card data only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. </p><p>Furthermore, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, we store only the last five digits on a server that is not accessible from the Internet. </p><p>If you feel more comfortable doing so, you may place your book order over the telephone by calling 800-839-8640. AuthorHouse has a department fully dedicated to placing book orders. </p><p>COOKIES <br>When you visit a website, information may be stored in a file known as a "cookie." This file is stored on your computer and is used for future reference. If you revisit a website, the cookie allows that website to identify you as a returning guest and tailor your shopping experience to you. </p>
<p>AuthorHouse's cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. We use them in two places. The first is when a user places an order. We use cookies to fill in their name and email address in the form where appropriate (this is known as "auto-fill.") The second is when a customer uses the <a href="http://www.authorhouse.com/ContactUs/">Contact Us</a> page. Again, we use cookies for auto-filling the form.</p>
<p>Most web browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your web browser's help file to learn more about these functions. </p><p>The information contained in our cookies is only used by AuthorHouse. Your web browser will not pass a cookie to a site other than the one that created it. </p><p>SECURITY <br>AuthorHouse's website has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of all information. </p><p>Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. </p><p>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES <br>When you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to third-party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy on the Internet, AuthorHouse is not responsible for the actions of third parties. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any website. </p><p>YOUR CONSENT AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES <br>By using AuthorHouse website, you consent to the collection of personally identifiable information and the collection and use of non-personally identifiable information. If our privacy policy changes, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of access, security, control of personal information, how information will be used, and whether it will be provided to third parties. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users through email. AuthorHouse users will always have a choice if we use their information in a different manner. AuthorHouse will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
<p>TELL US WHAT YOU THINK <br>AuthorHouse welcomes your questions and comments about privacy. Please email us using the<a href="http://www.authorhouse.com/ContactUs/"> 'Contact Us'</a> page. </p>
