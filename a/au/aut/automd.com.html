Once your credit card is Synced within the matchback process, it is referenced by a unique identifier code rather than by the actual credit card number. The matchback process provides AutoMD with the date of the transaction, the amount, the unique merchant identifier code from the participating Shop, and the unique credit card identifier code which allows AutoMD to credit your Synced credit card with the AutoMD Insta-Quotes! Cash Back Rebate amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that we engage or partner with a trusted business or person, including without limitation, third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of the Site and our business (“Service Providers”), we may share Personal Information with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use mapping or location based services companies to provide information on services available near your location.  In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. </p>
<p>When you use these services, you are providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties or for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.</p>
<p>You should also note that Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Site, may become publicly available.

In particular, certain information that you may provide about yourself, including without limitation, your “Image”, “Display Name”, “Location” and “About Me” information will be accessible by other users of the site and may become publicly viewable by anyone.  Your posting to such public areas of the Site constitutes your consent to share such information publicly.</p>
<p>The Site may contain links to other sites or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and to read the privacy policies of any web site that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered this Site through another web site, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site before providing any Personal Information to that site. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.</p>
<p>If AutoMD becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information involved in such transactions and provide notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.</p>
<p>Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the AutoMD Web Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately by emailing us at <a href="mailto:ContactInfo@AutoMD.com">ContactInfo@AutoMD.com</a> if you believe your password has been misused. You should also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an unsecured email.</p>
<p>We restrict access to Personal Information to AutoMD employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3>Accessing and updating Personal Information</h3>
<p>When you use AutoMD Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact information needs to be updated, you may do so by accessing and updating your user profile.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>AutoMD regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is AutoMD’s policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between AutoMD and an individual.</p>
