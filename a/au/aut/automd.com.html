email addresses collected on our website with advertisers (or their designated

indicated a preference not to receive commercial electronic mail messages from,

that AutoMD, one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is
acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the
transferred assets. We may allow others to search some of our databases (our
listings database, for example) and to analyze the data they find there or
aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours.
Though some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying
(such as the contact information included in a vehicle listing), we'll only
allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is
otherwise publicly available on our website. When we use other companies to
help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you, we may
provide them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to
