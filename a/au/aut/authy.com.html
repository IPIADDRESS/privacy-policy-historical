        <h1>Twilio Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
          Twilio Inc., 645 Harrison Street, Third Floor, San Francisco, CA 94107 ("Twilio"), is the responsible entity and has created the following Privacy Policy to describe how Twilio uses information it collects when people visit Twilio's website located at www.twilio.com (the "Twilio Site") or sign up to use Twilio's services (the "Services"). Twilio may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that will be posted on this webpage. If Twilio makes any material changes to this Privacy Policy, Twilio will provide notice of such changes through a posting on the Twilio Site or through another reasonable means of communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twilio abides by the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, as provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce and regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information received from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Twilio has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Twilio's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/
        </p>
        <h3>What information does Twilio collect?</h3>
        <p>
          When you use the Twilio Site or sign up for the Services, Twilio may collect certain contact information from you, including without limitation: first and last name, organization name, city, state and zip code, email address, and phone number (collectively, "Contact Information"). When purchasing Services, you will be required to provide additional information that may include a credit card number or other banking or payment information ("Billing Information").
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve the navigation experience on the Twilio site, Twilio also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including the pages you request ("Site Information").
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain Site Information is collected through Twilio's use of cookies. Cookies are sets of data which are stored by your web browser and which contain data. In as far as your consent is necessary in this respect, this will only take place if you have granted the required consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same applies to web beacons and other standard collection tools. These tools help provide additional functionality to the Twilio Site and help us analyze use of the Twilio Site more accurately. We may also use cookies to help track the level of interest in different features of the Twilio Site and to compile data that can help us improve our Services. You can choose not to use cookies but then you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Twilio Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the collection of Site Information, in connection with your use of the Services, Twilio may collect information that is created or provided by you for such purposes (collectively, "Service Information"). For example, if you enable users to send SMS messages through the Services, Twilio will collect and maintain the call data (recipient phone number, size and time of message and other transactional data). Service Information may include information that is Personally Identifiable Data (as defined in the next paragraph).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Contact Information, Billing Information, Site Information and Service Information may be referred to below, collectively, as the "Data". "Personally Identifiable Data" means that data which directly, or used in conjunction with other provided information, enables the identification of a specific individual.
        </p>
        <h3>How is Data used?</h3>
        <p>
          Twilio may use the Site Information to monitor the use of the Twilio Site and to improve the user experience associated with the Twilio Site. Twilio uses the Site Information internally and only as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not a customer of Twilio (i.e., if you have not signed up to receive the Services), Twilio will use your Contact Information only for the purpose for which such information was provided. For example, if you have signed up to receive product information from Twilio, we will use your Contact Information only to send you that information. You may always opt-out of the receipt of any of those communications. Email opt out instructions are contained in each email.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twilio uses and stores Service Information only for the purpose of conducting business with you. For example, we will use your Contact Information to provide you with access to the Services you have ordered, as well as support services, technical updates or updates on changes in Twilio's usage policies. Twilio may also use your Contact Information to send you company updates and marketing offers and information as long as you have expressly consented to receiving these or in case we have received your Contact Information in the course of a purchase of our Products and Services and we limit such marketing communication to similar Twilio products and services. You may opt-out at any time from receiving marketing information from Twilio by clicking the link in the respective electronic marketing communication and, as described in the preceding paragraph. You may not opt out from non-marketing communications, including service notifications and other operational updates. To note, Twilio's use of the Service Information is also governed by the agreement you enter into with Twilio in connection with the Services (the "Services Agreement"). Please refer to the Services Agreement for specific provisions concerning confidentiality and data protection. In the event of any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Services Agreement, the Services Agreement will control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, for clarification, this Privacy Policy applies if you are a visitor to the Twilio Site or if you purchase the Services. If you use a third party application or service that is integrated with Twilio, then such third party's privacy policy will govern the use, storage and disclosure of your data in connection with such application or service. Twilio may receive orders, subpoenas or other legal demands for Personally Identifiable Data that has been collected on behalf of such third party providers through the use of their applications or services. In such cases, Twilio refers the party requesting the Personally Identifiable Data to the applicable third party provider. That provider will respond in accordance with its own policies and may disclose your Personally Identifiable Data in response to such subpoena or other demand for information. Please remember that Twilio is not responsible for the policies and practices of such third party providers. If you have questions about any such disclosures, you should contact the applicable provider directly. Twilio will have no liability in connection with any act or omission of any such provider with respect to your data or information or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twilio takes reasonable precautions such as policy-based access control to protect Data in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. Twilio follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the Data, both during transmission and once received by Twilio. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While Twilio strives to protect your Data, Twilio does not guarantee its security.
        </p>
        <p>
          CalOPPA Disclosures: Twilio does not collect Personally Identifiable Data about a consumer's online activities over time and across different Web sites when consumers use the Twilio Site or Services.
