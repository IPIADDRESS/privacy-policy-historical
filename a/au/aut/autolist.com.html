<h1>
Privacy Policy
</h1>
<h2>
AutoList.com
</h2>
<p>
Welcome to this website ("Site"), as operated by Vertical Brands Media, Inc.  ("Company" or "we"). Company operates the Site and other associated services and offerings , including, without limitation, mobile and tablet applications, that allow users to list and/or locate cars, trucks or other automobiles for sale (collectively, the "Service"), and makes it available to you subject to the
<a href="/pages/terms">Terms of Service</a>
(the "Terms"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Service.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
This statement governs information you provide to us or that we learn from you and other users of the Service (individually "User" or collectively, "Users") through use of the Service, and describes how we may collect, use, and disclose this information.
</p>
<h3>
The Information Company Collects
</h3>
<p>
<b>
<span>
User Provided Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
You may provide to Company what is generally called "personally identifiable" or "personal" information when you register or use the Service, such as your name, e-mail address, gender, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number, as well as a variety of other personal information such as information about your demographic profile and interests. Any time you enter information into a form or other data entry field available on the Service, Company collects and stores any personal information you include.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Aggregate Data.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
"Cookies" Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Company uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. By using these cookies, we can "remember" what you have done on the Service before and personalize our site for you. These persistent types of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality available via the Service.  In addition, in order to recognize you, store your preferences, and track your use of any application, we may store your mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer) when you use the Service. Unlike cookies, mobile device IDs cannot be deleted.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
"Automatically Collected" Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
When you visit the Service or open one of our HTML emails, certain information from your web browser, mobile device or email client may be recorded through use of different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons". This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), mobile device type, web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view, and the dates and times that you use the Service. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we also allow analytics companies to use tracking technologies to collect information about our Users computers or mobile devices and their online activities. These companies analyze this information to help us understand how the Service is being used. Analytics companies may use mobile device IDs, as described in the paragraph above.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Third Party Buttons
</span>
</b>
<span>
. We may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook "like" or "share" buttons or Twitter "tweet" buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties' browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button.&nbsp; Information collected through buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and Company does not participate in that data transmission.  Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span></span>
</b>
<span>
You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use
of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties
(each, an "Integrated Service"), such as Google or Facebook credentials, or you
may otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide
personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect
with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name,
email address(es), education, profile pictures, interests and activities, your
gender and age, your hometown, school, employer, your username and other
information that the Integrated Service makes available to us. Company may use
and disclose any such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You
should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and
change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please
review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully
before using their services and connecting to our Service.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Information from Other Sources.
</span>
</b>
<span>
If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect
through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information
in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<b>
<span>

</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Third-Party Marketing.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
We may sell or render access to User information, including contact information, to third-party organizations for their use in marketing or promoting products or services that they believe you may be interested in based on your use of the Service.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>

</span>
</b>
<span>
Information about our Users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed or otherwise transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of Company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information is transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Public Areas
</span>
</b>
<span>
.

We cannot control who reads your posting or what other Users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Your Choices and Account
</h3>
<p>
<span>
You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with
Company, in which case Company will not be able to provide to you some or all
of the features and functionality found on the Service.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
If you receive promotional email from
Company, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions
contained within the email. Even after you opt-out from receiving promotional
messages from Company, you will continue to receive administrative messages

</span>
</p>
<p>

</span>
</p>
<h3>
Children
</h3>
<p>
<span>
Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we
do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent. Any person who provides
their personal information to Company through the Service represents that they
are 13 years of age or older. If you believe that we have collected information
from an individual under the age of 13, please contact us so that we may take
appropriate steps to address the issue.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Advertising and Remarketing
</h3>
<p>
<span>
Company may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad
networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
and links that appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP
Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as
cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further, these
advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for
Company products and services) based on information collected from you while
using the Service. For example, Company uses Google's "remarketing" service to
target Company ads to you based on your prior use of the Service when you visit
other sites in Google's content network.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to users based on a
certain audience or audience segment. If you respond to this type of targeted
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they were trying to reach.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers
or ad networks. Company's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot
control the activities of, such advertisers or other websites.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Links to Other Sites
</h3>
<p>
<span>
The Service may contain links or references to external websites. These are
provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the privacy
or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any personal
information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third
party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Please learn about
the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites before
providing them with personal information.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Our Commitment to Data Security
</h3>
<p>
<span>
No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
transmission, we take steps to protect your information from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, which may include use of
industry standard technologies and procedures. However, please note that this
is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed,
altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
If Company learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you
electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the
Service or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can
communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and
administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. Company may post a
notice on the Service if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will
need a web browser enabling you to view the Service. Company may also send an
email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these
circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a
security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice)
you should notify us via email at feedback@autolist.com.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Special Note to International Users
</h3>
<p>
<span>
The Service
is hosted in the United States, and all or a portion of the Service may also be
hosted on the "cloud", or other similar distributed hosting platform. If you
are a User accessing the Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other
region with laws governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that
differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your
personal data outside your home jurisdiction, including to the United States
which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and other regions,
and by providing your personal data you consent to Company's use of your
personal data for the uses identified above in accordance with the Privacy
Policy; and the transfer of your personal data to the United States and other
jurisdictions as indicated above.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy
</h3>
<p>
<span>
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the
"last updated" date on the Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy
Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of
personal information that you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain
your consent before implementing the change, and without your consent, the new
policy will not apply to information collected prior to the change. We
encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about
how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use
of the Service constitutes your going forward agreement to this Privacy Policy
and any updates.
