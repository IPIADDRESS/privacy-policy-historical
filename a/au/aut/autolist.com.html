</h2>
<p>
Welcome to this website ("Site"), as operated by Vertical Brands Media, Inc.  ("Company" or "we"). Company operates the Site and other associated services and offerings , including, without limitation, mobile and tablet applications, that allow users to list and/or locate cars, trucks or other automobiles for sale (collectively, the "Service"), and makes it available to you subject to the
<a href="http://www.AutoList.com/pages/terms">
Terms of Service
</a>
(the "Terms"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Terms of Service.  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
This statement governs information you provide to us or that we learn from you and other users of the Service (individually "User" or collectively, "Users") through use of the Service, and describes how we may collect, use, and disclose this information.
</p>
<h3>
The Information Company Collects
</h3>
<p>
<b>
<span>
User Provided Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
You may provide to Company what is generally called "personally identifiable" or "personal" information when you register or use the Service, such as your name, e-mail address, gender, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number, as well as a variety of other personal information such as information about your demographic profile and interests. Any time you enter information into a form or other data entry field available on the Service, Company collects and stores any personal information you include.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Aggregate Data.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
Aggregate data is data we collect about a group or category of features, services or individuals, from which individual identities have been removed. For example, information about how you use a feature may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same feature, without any personal information included in the resulting data.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
"Cookies" Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies â€“ small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters â€“ to your computer. Company uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. By using these cookies, we can "remember" what you have done on the Service before and personalize our site for you. These persistent types of cookies can be removed, but each web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality available via the Service.  In addition, in order to recognize you, store your preferences, and track your use of any application, we may store your mobile device IDs (the unique identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer) when you use the Service. Unlike cookies, mobile device IDs cannot be deleted.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
"Automatically Collected" Information.&nbsp;
</span>
</b>
<span>
When you visit the Service or open one of our HTML emails, certain information from your web browser, mobile device or email client may be recorded through use of different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons". This "automatically collected" information may include your Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), mobile device type, web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view, and the dates and times that you use the Service. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we also allow analytics companies to use tracking technologies to collect information about our UsersÂ’ computers or mobile devices and their online activities. These companies analyze this information to help us understand how the Service is being used. Analytics companies may use mobile device IDs, as described in the paragraph above.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Third Party Buttons
</span>
</b>
<span>
. We may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook "like" or "share" buttons or Twitter "tweet" buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties' browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button.&nbsp; Information collected through buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and Company does not participate in that data transmission.  Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span></span>
</b>
<span>

of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties
(each, an "Integrated Service"), such as Google or Facebook credentials, or you
may otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide
personal information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect
with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name,
email address(es), education, profile pictures, interests and activities, your
gender and age, your hometown, school, employer, your username and other
information that the Integrated Service makes available to us. Company may use
and disclose any such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You
should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and
change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please
review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully
before using their services and connecting to our Service.

<b>

<b>

</span>
</b>
<span>
Information about our Users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed or otherwise transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, or sale of Company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information is transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
Public Areas

We cannot control who reads your posting or what other Users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Your Choices and Account

<h3>
Children
</h3>
<p>
<span>
Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we
do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent. Any person who provides
their personal information to Company through the Service represents that they
are 13 years of age or older. If you believe that we have collected information
from an individual under the age of 13, please contact us so that we may take
appropriate steps to address the issue.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Advertising and Remarketing
</h3>
<p>
<span>
Company may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to
serve advertisements within the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad
networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements
and links that appear on the Service. They automatically receive your IP
Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as
cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further, these
advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for
Company products and services) based on information collected from you while
using the Service. For example, Company uses Google's "remarketing" service to
target Company ads to you based on your prior use of the Service when you visit
other sites in Google's content network.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to users based on a
certain audience or audience segment. If you respond to this type of targeted
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they were trying to reach.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers
or ad networks. Company's Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot
control the activities of, such advertisers or other websites.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
Links to Other Sites
</h3>
<p>
<span>
The Service may contain links or references to external websites. These are
provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the privacy
or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any personal
information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third
party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Please learn about
the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites before
providing them with personal information.
</span>
</p>
<h3>
