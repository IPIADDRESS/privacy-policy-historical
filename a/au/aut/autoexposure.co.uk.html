</p>
<h4>2. Collection and Use of Data</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
2.1 The personal information we collect from you includes:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(a) personal information obtained from you via the Site;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(b) personal information you provide about yourself in order to sell or buy a vehicle or manage your account on the Site;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(c) personal information you send to us in personal correspondence such as emails, letters or over the telephone; and
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(d) personal information we receive from other users or third parties about you and/or your activities.
</p>
<p>
The type of personal information we collect could include your name and address, vehicle registration mark, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses and financial and credit card information.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
2.2 The personal information you provide to us will be used for the purposes of administration, processing the sale and purchase of a vehicle (including registering interest in vehicles for sale and advertising vehicles for sale), the evaluation of our services, business development, trend analysis and marketing. We will also use it to create offers specifically designed to meet your needs and as set out in clause 3 below. &nbsp;We may contact you by e-mail, text message or telephone calls based on transactional needs in relation to the purposes detailed in this clause 2.2 and for promotional purposes regarding marketing material and special offers that may be of interest to you. Should you wish to unsubscribe from any promotional communications from us, please follow the process outlined in such communication, or e-mail your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@motors.co.uk">privacy@motors.co.uk</a>.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
2.3 Please note that there may be times when we use third parties to store and process your information on our behalf. On any such occasions, we will require any such third parties to strictly comply with our instructions and to not use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
2.4 We may store, process and/or transfer personal information to countries outside of the EEA, especially to servers in the US. If you do not agree to this procedure you should not use our products or services. Your personal information, on some occasions, is transferred outside the EEA to a carefully selected third party, for our data management and business purposes, in particular, for certain outsourced data processing undertaken by organisations on our behalf. By using our products and/or services you consent to our transferring your personal information to countries outside the EEA, if necessary, for our legitimate business purposes as outlined above. We will take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is adequately protected.
</p>
<p>

To comply with the adequacy requirements of the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, any above mentioned third party will be a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union or have entered into an agreement with us that includes the EC model clauses approved by the European Commission.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
2.6 We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are small text files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customised services.

2.7 Please note that we will not hold your personal information for any longer than is reasonably necessary or required by law.
</p>
<h4>3. Disclosure of Data</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.1 We may share your personal information with:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
a) business partners, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with you;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(b) analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of the Site;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(c) credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(d) third party recipients of our services in order to demonstrate the commercial value of our services to those third parties, where we have informed you of this and obtained your consent at the time of collection of your personal information; and
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
(e) if you have provided your consent, third party marketers of auto-related products, motor manufacturers and other services that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, your personal information may sometimes also be used by us and members of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006) to inform you about changes to the Site, new services and offers that you might find interesting and for database maintenance.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to change personal information held about you or the information you receive from us, please email our Compliance Department or write to:
</p>

</p>
<p>
In your correspondence to us, please set out what it is that you would like to see changed about your personal information.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.2 Your personal information may also be shared with auditors or contractors or other advisers auditing or advising us on our business operations.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.3 We co-operate with law enforcement agencies, as well as other third parties, to assist in the enforcement of laws. We can (and you authorise us to by the acceptance of these terms through the continuous use the Site) disclose any personal information about you to such law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with any investigation by such law enforcement agencies or other government officials.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.4 We may transfer, sell or assign any of the personal information described in this Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business (or any part of our group).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.5 We have the appropriate security measures in place in relation to how your personal information is stored and used, and who can see it. We use industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal, identifiable information, including "firewalls" and "secure socket layers". While such measures help stop any unauthorised disclosure of your information, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our system.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
3.6 In addition, the transmission of personal information via the internet is not completely secure. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security measures to try to prevent unauthorised access. However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, any more than any other company can. Please note therefore that any transmission of your personal information to the Site is at your own risk and we cannot accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of any personal information which you have provided to us if there is a security breach.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">

<h4>5. Online Interactive Facilities</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">

</p>
<h4><a name="6. Manheim's Use of Cookies">6. Manheim's Use of Cookies</a></h4>
<p>
The law on cookies changed in May 2011. Under the revised regulations, the requirement is not just to provide clear information about the cookies but also to obtain consent from users or subscribers to store a cookie on their device. It has been designed to protect online privacy by making consumers aware of how personal information about them is collected by websites, and enabling them to choose whether or not they want it to happen. Please read on for more information.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
6.1 <strong>What is a cookie?</strong> A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from our web server to your browser, which is saved on the hard drive of your computer, smartphone or other device ("your device").
</p>
<p>
A cookie cannot:
</p>
<ul>
<li>read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites;</li>
<li>damage your system;</li>
<li>run programmes on your computer; or</li>
<li>deliver viruses.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being sent at any time. If you do choose not to accept cookies, some features of the Site may not work as intended (e.g. services accessed while logged in, customised areas of the Site). We do not use cookies to identify you personally, except when you opt to use the 'Remember me' facility when logging in.
</p>
<p>
There are two broad classes of cookie: session and permanent.
</p>
<h5>Session cookies</h5>
<p>
These are used to keep track of information needed by a user and their browser on their journey through a website. Session cookies have a short lifetime and expire within a few minutes of the user leaving the site. Occasionally we will use 30 Day cookies which are similar to Session cookies but last a bit longer. They remember basic date to help improve the service you receive from us (for example, remembering vehicles that you have viewed in the last 30 days).
</p>
<h5>Permanent Cookies</h5>
<p>
These are stored on your computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. This is so they can retain your preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.
</p>
<p>
Permanent cookies can be used to analyse users' surfing behaviour within the Site, so that we can improve our services and allows us to prioritise our enhancements to the Site.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
6.2 <strong>We use cookies to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">to keep you logged in for the duration of your visit, which enables you to complete certain actions on the Site, for example, move from one page to another within the Site, adding cars to a shortlist, using watchlists and viewing catalogues;</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site for you</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site;</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment"; and</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">enable basic web traffic analysis using Google Analytics and other web analytics tools</li>
<li style="margin-left: 80px;">deliver targeted adverts based on session data collected by cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also use some cookies from trusted third party sources to enable us to provide you with certain features on the Site, for example our live chat facility which uses cookies to enable the chat software to work.
</p>
<p>
When you access the Site you will receive a message advising you that if you continue to use the Site, you are consenting to cookies being placed on your device in order to maximise your experience on the Site and allow us to make improvements
</p>
<p>
Removing some of our cookies may seriously disrupt your use of the Site. You can always come back to this Privacy Policy at any time to find out how to change your preferences. You will find a link to this policy at the bottom of all of our web pages.
</p>
<p>
Information is collected by reference to the IP address that you are using and includes information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. The information is sometimes used to place interest-based advertisements on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
</p>
<p>
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. Visiting www.allaboutcookies.org will provide information on settings within your browser as well as other useful information on cookies. Please note however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site if you do so.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
6.3 How do I disable cookies?
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being sent at any time.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
Further guidance on how to control and delete cookies can be found at http://www.allaboutcookies.org. Please note that removing some of our cookies may seriously disrupt your use of the Site and some features may not work as intended.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
We do use some cookies from trusted third party sources to enable us to provide you with certain features on the Site and have included any relevant third parties on our cookie list so that you can control the cookies they place more easily.<br>
