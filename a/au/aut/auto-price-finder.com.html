	           <h3>Auto-Price-Finder Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Welcome to Auto-Price-Finder.com (the "Site").  Auto-Price-Finder PRIVACY POLICY (this "Policy") Effective Date: December 4, 2009.  Because your privacy is important to us, we provide this statement to explain the Site's online information practices.  Auto-Price-Finder ("Auto-Price-Finder", "we", "us" or "our") discloses the information collection and usage practices applicable to the Site in this Policy.</p>

<p>This privacy statement covers the website www.Auto-Price-Finder.com and applies to all information about you ("you") collected through the Site.</p>

<p>Auto-Price-Finder ("Auto-Price-Finder", "we", "us" or "our") discloses the information collection and usage practices applicable to the Site in this Policy. This Policy describes the types of information that we gather from you and the other people who visit the Site (the "Users") and how we may use that information. By providing any information, you agree to our use of that information consistent with this Policy.</p>

<p>We collect personally identifiable information from our Users at several different points on our Site. When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Please read this Policy carefully before providing us with any information. If you have questions about this Policy, e-mail us at info@Auto-Price-Finder</p>

<h3>Our General Policies and Practices</h3>

<b>Registration</b><br>

<p>We provide a service that helps people obtain price quotes for used or new vehicles and/or request quotes for vehicle financing and insurance. In order to perform that service, we need to collect and distribute personally identifiable information. We are committed to the responsible handling of any personal information you provide to us. This means we will use it only as outlined below. Users are welcome to browse our Site; however, in order to participate in some of our services, Users will be required to complete brief registration forms. These forms may or may not ask for personally identifiable information. When personally identifiable information is collected, it is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Information entered by Users may be transmitted to our trusted business partners who fulfill the services requested by those Users.</p>

<b>Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>

<p>All Users have the option of providing various types of personally identifiable information to us through the Site. For example, you may choose to provide us your personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, potential trade-in vehicles, employer and employment status, credit history, residence information, bankruptcy status, date of birth, household income and availability of a cosigner for a loan. We collect this personally identifiable information when you, at any point, manually enter it into any online form available on the Site. We may also store your personally identifiable information in our systems for use in other ways as described in this Policy.</p>

<p>In order for you to take full advantage of the Site, we encourage you to provide your personally identifiable information to us. Providing your personally identifiable information, however, is completely voluntary. You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information by simply not entering it on the Site. While you will still have access to the Site even if you do not provide us with your personally identifiable information, you should understand that you will not be able to use certain of the services or features available through the Site that require you to enter your personally identifiable information in order to function.</p>

<p>If you do not input any of your personally identifiable information, then the information we collect from you is limited. For example, we log your IP address in order to help us to diagnose problems with our servers, administer the Site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access the Site through an always-on type of Internet connection (such as cable or DSL), or through a dial-up connection. Either way, it would be very difficult for us to personally identify you through your IP address. We match IP addresses to completed User registration forms for validation and error checking purposes. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or ad from another website, then we may also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of our Users. In general, this information is used to generate overall anonymous reports on our Users that enable us to improve the effectiveness of the Site.</p>

<h3>Information collected without action on your part</h3>

<b>Cookies</b><br>

<p>When you visit the Site, we often send one or more small files known as "cookies" to your computer. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through the Site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you provide us with personally identifiable information, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow us to personally identify you. If you do provide personally identifiable information to us, the cookie is tied to this information so that our systems will recognize you each time you visit the Site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized version of the Site, without requiring you to log into the Site every time you visit. Our cookies cannot be used to read any other data from your computer and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other sites. We use cookies to help us understand how Users use the Site, and to help us to improve the Site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures for rejecting cookies specific to your web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Site, but other websites as well.</p>

<p>If you visit the website of one of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) by clicking on a link from our Site, they may also use cookies on their website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Auto-Price-Finder only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other websites.</p>

<b>User Activity Tracking</b><br>

<p>We employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a User's visit to the Site. This technology helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. The software uses two methods to track User activity: 1) "trackers" and 2) "clear gifs". Trackers are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, which are embedded in web pages and e-mail messages that track whether or not a User has viewed a particular web page or e-mail message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a User's session, such as IP Address and the type of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User.</p>

<p>If you arrive at the Site by "clicking through" from another website, and you have registered with that other website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Site, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Site in order to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information. We may or may not retain information about you provided to us by other websites. If we do, we will only use it in accordance with this Policy. Such information may or may not be associated with other User activity data or personally identifiable information.</p>

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Site. Users' personally identifiable information collected through surveys or contests is not shared with third parties who are not agents, service providers or business partners, unless we give prior notice and receive your permission for the sharing. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, these intermediaries will not use the Users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>

<b>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers</b><br>

<p>Auto-Price-Finder may contract with third parties to provide various services to Auto-Price-Finder relating to the Site on an outsourced basis. For example, we may contract with an e-mail provider to handle the distribution of e-mail messages to Users of the Site. We may contract with a website hosting provider to host the Site for us. We may also contract with various validation services to confirm contact information that you provide. By visiting the Site, all Users consent to Auto-Price-Finder providing all information (whether or not personally identifiable) received or collected from those Users to such third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to us. In addition, all Users consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their information (whether or not personally identifiable) by Auto-Price-Finder and these third party providers.</p>

<p>We will share information provided by Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with certain trusted business partners in our network so that they can contact you with information about the services in which you have expressed interest. In order to provide the services available to you on this Site, we may also supplement your information (whether or not personally identifiable) with information from third party sources with whom we have contracted for the purpose of verifying the contact information you have provided. You have the option not to have your information shared with business partners by not requesting these services.</p>

<p>We may also share information about Users (whether or not personally identifiable) with our business partners and affiliated companies so that we can offer you a broader range of services and information to meet your needs.

<b>Other Web Sites; Links</b><br>

<p>Please be aware that Auto-Price-Finder affiliated institutions, promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party web sites accessible through the Site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. Auto-Price-Finder is not responsible for any actions, content of websites or privacy policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information through linked websites.</p>

<b>Disclosure of Your Information</b><br>

<p>As you might expect, Auto-Price-Finder must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose information (including personally identifiable information) in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We don't expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the information required. We can also turn over information about you if we believe we must do so in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this Policy, you consent to our right to do so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we believe we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us:
	</p><ul>
	<li>To protect the company's rights and property;
	</li><li>To investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false e-mail address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages;
	</li><li>To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web site; or
	</li><li>During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at risk.
	</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>At some point, Auto-Price-Finder may establish subsidiaries or other related companies, or merge with or be acquired by another company. When that happens, then we may disclose to them your personally identifiable information, in which case we will request them to abide by this Policy. We may also disclose some personally identifiable information to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to normal and customary requirements.</p>

<p>If we make a material change to this Policy, we will post a notice on the home page regarding the amended Policy, so that you are aware of what personally identifiable information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review the Site frequently for any changes. Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any amended or revised Policy by your continued use of our services or the Site.</p>

<p>Of course, Auto-Price-Finder will take reasonable measures to secure the personally identifiable information Users provide to us, using industry-standard methods. All personally identifiable information is protected by password and accessible only to authorized Auto-Price-Finder personnel. However, there is a remote possibility that Internet transmissions containing a User's personally identifiable information may be intercepted by others. There is no way for us to ensure the privacy of User information before it arrives at the Site or after it leaves the Site.</p>
