<p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Last Revised: June 3, 2018</p>
<p>Autozel cares about your privacy.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our world-class products, services, websites and mobile applications (collectively, our “Services”). Your personal data includes information such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Telephone number</p>
<p>Date of birth</p>
<p>Email address</p>
<p>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data. It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at <strong><span style="background: white; font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><a href="mailto:privacy@autozel.com">privacy@autozel.com</a></span></strong>.&nbsp; This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">What information do we collect?</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services.<span>&nbsp; </span>Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number); </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.<span>&nbsp; </span>These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Account related information</span></strong> is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, purchases, when products renew or expire, information requests, and customer service requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
