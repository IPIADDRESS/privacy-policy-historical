<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our websites use cookies to enable certain functionality, and for user analytics. By using our site, you agree that we can place these cookies on your device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most websites set cookies and browsers are typically set up to accept cookies, at least for the duration of a single browsing session. If you wish to change your cookie preferences you can do so using your browser settings. Your browser’s ‘help’ function will show you how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have always used cookies on this website, and as part of a change in legislation, all websites are now required to provide additional information on what cookies are, how they are used and what benefits they bring. These changes will not affect the way in which you currently use our website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we include links to other websites, please bear in mind they will have their own privacy and cookie policies that will govern the use of any information you submit. We recommend you read their policies as we are not responsible or liable for their privacy practices.</span></p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE "COOKIES"</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply, cookies to help websites distinguish individual browsers from each other. Cookies are small pieces of data which are stored for a website by your browser. Every time it loads a page your browser will send that page back the cookies it had set previously. This allows a website to connect your interactions together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies can’t be shared between websites, and each site can only read and update the cookies it set itself. However when you visit our a single website your browser may connect to others, and each of these may set cookies of their own. You can find out more about the cookies set when you visit our websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cookie cannot give anyone access to your computer and doesn’t mean we’re collecting new information from you. If you want more information about cookies, you can get further details on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allaboutcookies.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><strong>WHAT COOKIES DO WE SET?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of cookies we use are divided into four categories:</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Functional cookies:</strong>&nbsp;these cookies let you move around our websites and use all their options. Without them, the website would not work as it should.</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Analytics and performance cookies:</strong>&nbsp;these help us improve the way our website works to give improved performance. They tell us how each page is used, which ones are most commonly viewed and whether any errors are reported.</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Customisation cookies:</strong>&nbsp;these cookies remember basic information that you’ve entered into the site, so next time you visit our website it’s all there for you. We do not store personal information in cookies.</span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Targeting cookies:</strong> these cookies help make sure adverts you see on your browser are relevant and useful to you because the cookie has detected what you’re looking for.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>CHANGE OF PURPOSE&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please </span><a href="https://www.autodata-group.com/uk/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</span></p>
<p><strong>7. DATA SECURITY&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</span></p>
<p><strong>8. DATA RETENTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</span></p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.autodata-group.com/uk/contact-us/">contacting us</a></p>
<p>More specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for 7 years after they cease being customers for tax, financial auditing, and record keeping purposes.</p>
<p>In some applicable circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research, analytics, or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see Glossary below for a more detailed explanation about these rights:</p>

<p><strong>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><strong>10. GLOSSARY</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Legitimate Interest </strong>means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you and the marketplace the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="https://www.autodata-group.com/uk/contact-us/">contacting us.</a></p>
<p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong>&nbsp;means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong> </strong>means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internal Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>Other companies in the Autodata Group, acting either as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the EEA and provide IT and system administration services and undertake information reporting.</p>
<p><strong>External Third Parties</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Service providers acting as processors based in the EEA who provide IT and system administration services.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Professional advisers, acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the EEA who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities, acting as processors or joint controllers, based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing, financial, or transaction activities in certain circumstances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Public authorities such as the police, acting as joint controllers, based in the United Kingdom who require personal data in certain circumstances to prevent or apprehend crime or fraud.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>   </div>
