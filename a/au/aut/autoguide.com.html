			<p>Primedia and its family of consumer publications and web sites are strongly 
				committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for

				publications and services to them. Because we gather certain types of 
				information about and from users and subscribers so that we can fulfill your

				terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of this information. 
				This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how 
				to correct or change it, and what steps we take to safeguard personal 
				information provided to us both online and offline. Please note that some of 
				our websites are subject to separate privacy policies. We encourage you to 
				always check the privacy policy on each website you visit to be sure you 
				understand the privacy policy governing that site. Please read the complete 
				Online Privacy Policy below, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, and

			</p>
			
			<p><strong><a name="1">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</a></strong></p>
			<p>You can visit our websites, read articles and other materials, and check on 
				offerings without giving us any personally identifiable information. So that we 
				can provide our users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced, 
				personalized service, we request information about you in certain 
				circumstances, and also collect certain information automatically. We also use 
				contact lists and other information we may obtain from third parties. For the 
				convenience of our customers and to better serve you, a customer account 
				includes all the collected personal information we may have, but you can update 
				or correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving 
				offers and information from us or third parties at any time.
			</p>
			<p><strong><em>Information Users Volunteer</em></strong></p>
			<p>We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing 
				addresses, and/or e-mail addresses, when you subscribe to one of our magazines 
				or place an order (see the section below for more information on subscriptions 
				and orders), or through optional, voluntary registration at one of our web 
				sites. Occasionally, we may also request demographic information, such as age, 
				gender, hobbies or interests. Often this additional information is optional or 
				requested anonymously in connection with a survey. Website visitors may 
				register to receive one of our e-mail updates, or to enter online contests and 
				sweepstakes, and we may offer offline contests and sweepstakes as well. 
				Registration may also be required to participate in message boards, bulletin 
				boards, or chat rooms at our websites, and may be requested in connection with 
				certain surveys.
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes registration can be accomplished by submitting only a user name and 
				password. Other types of offerings require submission of additional 
				information. The information we collect may include your e-mail address, name, 
				address, phone number, age, gender, hobbies, family information, and similar 
				demographic information or information related to your interests. For example, 
				our automotive publications and websites may ask about the type of car you 
				drive. Registration forms will indicate what information is required and what 
				information (if any) is optional. This information may be collected during 
				registration on a site or in connection with specific activities, for example, 
				signing up for a newsletter, entering a sweepstakes or contest, or answering a 
				survey.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Subscriptions and Orders</em></strong></p>
			<p>If you wish to subscribe to one of our publications or place an order for 
				products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account 
				with us or our vendors. In addition to the customary information needed to fill 
				your order (full name, address, ship-to name and address, gift information, 
				etc.), subscriptions and orders necessitate collection of additional personal 
				information, such as your credit card number and credit card expiration date. 
				Most of our websites allow visitors to subscribe to our publications online, 
				and some sites also offer areas where you may purchase items online. We offer 
				online and offline subscribers a "bill me" option if they do not wish to use a 
				credit card, but visitors should check online stores to see if other payment 
				options are permitted for online store purchases apart from credit cards.
			</p>
			<p><strong><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></strong></p>
			<p>We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times 
				and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at 
				our websites. In addition, we use cookies to track usage patterns at our site 
				and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities 
				(such as screening for age, helping to track items in your shopping basket at 
				sites which offer online shopping opportunities, and "recognizing" you to speed 
				up your log-in when you visit our sites). See below for more detail on cookies.<br>
				<br>
				<strong><em>Other Information</em></strong></p>
			<p>We conduct market research in an effort to continually improve our 
				publications and websites and may purchase lists of potential subscribers or 
				customers from third parties. Those lists may include information on current 
				subscribers or customers. This information is included in our database. That 
				helps us, for example, minimize multiple mailings and e-mailings, and provide 
				information tailored to your interests.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="2">WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</a></strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our 
				publications, products and services. We may, from time to time, produce reports 
				for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate 
				information about our users and subscribers, such as demographic, age and 
				online usage information. This allows us to provide content and offers that are 
				most relevant to our subscribers and users and to work more closely with 
				advertisers. We do not include any personally identifiable information of our 
				users in these reports.
			</p>
			<p>We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, 
				personalized content to our website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, 
				e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information 
				or offers to our users and subscribers. A user may, at any time, opt out of 
				receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and 
				administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, like 
				subscription and other orders, respond to any problems that may arise, such as 
				magazine delivery failures, difficulties in navigating our sites or accessing 
				certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products 
				and services are most popular with users.
			</p>
			<p>We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other 
				parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses 
				(unless you are a member who already has voluntarily provided your email 
				address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they 
				are sent, and do not share "send a friend" e-mail addresses with third parties.
			</p>
			<p>Of course, we use personal information to allow you to subscribe online or to 
				make product purchases at certain of our websites. Rest assured that we and our 
				technical and fulfillment agents and consultants follow careful procedures to 
				safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="3">HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
			<p>Personal information is available to Primedia and its technical and 
				fulfillment agents and consultants who make this site and our publications, 
				products and services available to you. Anonymous information is available to 
				our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. We share your 
				personal information with third parties only as described below.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Primedia and Its Agents.</em></strong> Primedia may access both 
				anonymous, aggregate demographic data and any personal information you provide 
				for internal marketing purposes, including sending you notices of subscription 
				renewal deadlines, new publications, services or products we offer likely to be 
				of interest, and filling subscription and other orders. To facilitate 
				subscriptions and orders, Primedia will cache your order information, and 
				create an authorization with a merchant account (i.e., your credit card 
				company). There are many companies who may be required to assist Primedia in 
				making its publications, products and web sites available to you. Web host 
				firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, and 
				fulfillment firms, including firms assisting us in offering contests and 
				promotions, may have access to personally identifiable information in the 
				course of making our products and services available. All companies working for 
				Primedia must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure 
				policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to 
				use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.
			</p>
			<p><strong><em>Participating Vendors</em></strong>. Some of our sites offer 
				opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On 
				sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will 
				also give participating manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or distributors 
				the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you 
				order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the 
				information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that 
				information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they 
				provide. Primedia is not responsible for their privacy policies, and urges you 
				to inquire about their information practices. In addition, all vendors will 
				receive the same anonymous, aggregate data that our advertisers do.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Credit Card Companies.</em></strong> As in any transaction, your 
				credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the 
				vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. Primedia will not otherwise 
				provide any personal data to your credit card company.
			</p>
			<p><strong><em>Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners.</em></strong>
				We share anonymous, aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, 
				income, hobbies, interests, etc.), and anonymous information obtained from 
				cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional 
				and business partners, and with participating vendors at sites offering online 
				sales opportunities. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any 
				of these third parties in providing these reports. Credit card numbers, bank 
				account numbers, and passwords are not shared with advertisers, sponsors or 
				promotional partners, and are only shared with specific vendors with whom you 
				place an online order.
				<br><br>
				We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. 
				These companies may use information (not including your  name, address, email address 
				or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide 
				advertisements about  goods and services of interest to you.  If you would like more 
				information  about  this  practice and to know your choices about not having this  
				information  used  by  these  companies, <a class="listedLink" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">click here</a>.
				
				</p>
			<p>Offline and online contact information is handled differently. As is customary 
				in the publications business, offline contact information is shared with third 
				parties who may send you offers or information about their products or 
				services. <strong>You must opt-out if you do not wish to receive information from 
					us or third parties by mail. </strong>
			</p>
			<p><strong>Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you opt-in 
					to receiving information from third parties.</strong> In other words, we may 
				extend e-mail offers to users or subscribers on behalf of our business partners 
				about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but only 
				if you have indicated that you would like to receive those offers. If you wish 
				to receive such offers, we do not share or disclose your name or e-mail address 
				to those business partners, but will send you the information or offers on 
				their behalf. As result, although Primedia may receive a fee from our business 
				partners for this service, Primedia sends all the offers so that your personal 
				information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may 
				opt out of receiving those offers at any time.
			</p>
			<p>Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers 
				from third parties not affiliated with Primedia. If you decide to accept these 
				offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the 
				third party. At our websites, visitors will also have opportunities to sign up 
				directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests or 
				sweepstakes, receive e-mail updates, or to receive information directly from 
				them. Third party vendors and advertisers will also use technical and other 
				consultants. We urge visitors to carefully review the privacy policies of these 
				firms. Primedia is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of 
				any third party.</p>
			<p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or 
				otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Primedia's websites or 
				any other service available online), that information can be collected and used 
				by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards or message 
				boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail 
				address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Primedia has no 
				control over this use of your personal information.
			</p>
			<p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p>
			<p>We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or 
				consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct 
				investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect 
				the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our 
				visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal 
				investigation.
			</p>
			<p><strong><a name="5">HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</a></strong>
			</p>
			<p>Your Web browser offers so-called "cookies" which, if you allow their use, 
				store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies 
				do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore 
				cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which 
				of our features you like best. Cookies also enable us to customize our content 
				according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline 
				cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you 
				disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, 
				some advanced and customized features or offerings will not be available to 
				you. Our third party advertisers may also use cookies.
			</p>
			<p><strong><a name="6">HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS?</a></strong>
			</p>
			<p>Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, 
				which are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users 
				who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may 
				include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to 
				count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not 
				used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a 
				technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web 
				beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, 
				time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web 
				beacon resides. Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there 
				by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our 
				advertising campaigns.
			</p>
			<p><strong><a name="7">WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</a></strong></p>
			<p>Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by outside 
				companies. These ads contain cookies and may also contain Web beacons. Unlike 
				cookies and Web beacons used by Primedia in content it controls at its Web 
				sites, cookies or Web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our 
				advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use reputable 
				third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within 
				our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable 
				information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in 
				serving advertisements to you. They may share anonymous information with their 
				clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP 
				address, etc. DoubleClick is our third party ad server. If you would like to 
				know more about their information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, 
				please see <a class="listedLink" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy</a>.
			</p>
			<p><strong><a name="8">HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
			<p>We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to customer 
				satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your contact 
				information or change your preferences.</p>
			<p>1. If you have an online account at one of our websites, you may be able to 
				log on and update or change your contact or account information. Check the site 
				for further information.
				<br>
				2. You may unsubscribe to any of our online e-mail updates by following the 
				unsubscribe instructions in the body of any message.<br>
				3. You may write to us and update your contact information or ask that we not 
				share your personal contact information with third parties at: Primedia, Inc., 
				c/o Privacy Coordinator, 745 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10151. In those 
				instances, we will retain your information in a "do not promote" file in our 
				database.
				<br>
				4. You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@primedia.com" class="listedLink">privacypolicy@primedia.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests 
				promptly, but you may still receive promotional information from us by mail for 
				up to 60 days due to printing and mailing schedules, and up to 10 days for 
				e-mail.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="9">SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</a></strong>
			</p>
			<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, 
				such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access 
				during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard 
				industry practices internally and with our service providers suitable to the 
				degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of 
				your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in 
				this policy.
				<br>
				Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created 
				when you registered at one of our websites where this feature is offered. The 
				confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime 
				by following the instructions at the website where you registered.
				<br>
				Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when 
				maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. 
				Primedia employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic 
				communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those 
				Primedia employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this 
				information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure 
				environments. To maintain the highest level of security, we conduct internal 
				reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Remember, however, that 
				any personal information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available 
				to anyone.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="10">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</a></strong>
			</p>
			<p>Most of our publications and web sites are intended for adults. Some web sites 
				and publications, however, are intended for teens 13 and older but may include 
				features or material that may be appealing to children under the age of 13. 
				Primedia is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children 
				who visit our Web sites. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
				online from children under 13 and have adopted techniques to age-screen users 
				on our teen-oriented sites to ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and 
				the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its 
				accompanying regulations establish United States federal law that protects the 
				privacy of children using the Internet. Many of our sites include chat rooms, 
				bulletin boards and other features that we believe are unsuitable for children 
				under 13 and which are not necessarily monitored. We encourage all parents to 
				talk to their kids about online safety and to monitor their children's use of 
				the Internet.
			</p>
			<p><strong><a name="11">LINKS</a></strong></p>
			<p>Primedia may offer links to or from Web sites it controls to other sites
