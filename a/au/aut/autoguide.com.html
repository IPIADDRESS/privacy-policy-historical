<p align="center"><strong>PRIMEDIA CONSUMER PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
		<p>Primedia and its family of consumer publications and web sites are strongly 
			committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for 
			all of our users and subscribers while offering the highest quality 
			publications and services to them. Because we gather certain types of 
			information about and from users and subscribers so that we can fulfill your

			This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, how

			<a href="#15">Contact Information</a></strong>
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><a name="1">WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</a></strong></p>
		<p>You can visit our websites, read articles and other materials, and check on 
			offerings without giving us any personally identifiable information. So that we 
			can provide our users and subscribers with the most efficient and enhanced, 
			personalized service, we request information about you in certain 
			circumstances, and also collect certain information automatically. We also use 
			contact lists and other information we may obtain from third parties. For the 
			convenience of our customers and to better serve you, a customer account 
			includes all the collected personal information we may have, but you can update 
			or correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving 
			offers and information from us or third parties at any time.
		</p>
		<p><strong><em>Information Users Volunteer</em></strong></p>
		<p>We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing 
			addresses, and/or e-mail addresses, when you subscribe to one of our magazines 
			or place an order (see the section below for more information on subscriptions 
			and orders), or through optional, voluntary registration at one of our web 
			sites. Occasionally, we may also request demographic information, such as age, 
			gender, hobbies or interests. Often this additional information is optional or 
			requested anonymously in connection with a survey. Website visitors may 
			register to receive one of our e-mail updates, or to enter online contests and 
			sweepstakes, and we may offer offline contests and sweepstakes as well. 
			Registration may also be required to participate in message boards, bulletin 
			boards, or chat rooms at our websites, and may be requested in connection with 
			certain surveys.
		</p>
		<p>Sometimes registration can be accomplished by submitting only a user name and 
			password. Other types of offerings require submission of additional 
			information. The information we collect may include your e-mail address, name, 
			address, phone number, age, gender, hobbies, family information, and similar 
			demographic information or information related to your interests. For example, 
			our automotive publications and websites may ask about the type of car you 
			drive. Registration forms will indicate what information is required and what 
			information (if any) is optional. This information may be collected during 
			registration on a site or in connection with specific activities, for example, 
			signing up for a newsletter, entering a sweepstakes or contest, or answering a 
			survey.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Subscriptions and Orders</em></strong></p>
		<p>If you wish to subscribe to one of our publications or place an order for 
			products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account 
			with us or our vendors. In addition to the customary information needed to fill 
			your order (full name, address, ship-to name and address, gift information, 
			etc.), subscriptions and orders necessitate collection of additional personal 
			information, such as your credit card number and credit card expiration date. 
			Most of our websites allow visitors to subscribe to our publications online, 
			and some sites also offer areas where you may purchase items online. We offer 
			online and offline subscribers a "bill me" option if they do not wish to use a 
			credit card, but visitors should check online stores to see if other payment 
			options are permitted for online store purchases apart from credit cards.
		</p>
		<p><strong><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></strong></p>
		<p>We also may collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times 
			and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at 
			our websites. In addition, we use cookies to track usage patterns at our site 
			and to control the display of ads, as well as to offer other functionalities 
			(such as screening for age, helping to track items in your shopping basket at 
			sites which offer online shopping opportunities, and "recognizing" you to speed 
			up your log-in when you visit our sites). See below for more detail on cookies.<br>
			<br>
			<strong><em>Other Information</em></strong></p>
		<p>We conduct market research in an effort to continually improve our 
			publications and websites and may purchase lists of potential subscribers or 
			customers from third parties. Those lists may include information on current 
			subscribers or customers. This information is included in our database. That 
			helps us, for example, minimize multiple mailings and e-mailings, and provide 
			information tailored to your interests.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="2">WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</a></strong>
			<br>
			<br>
			We use information you provide to fulfill your requests and improve our 
			publications, products and services. We may, from time to time, produce reports 
			for advertisers, sponsors and vendors containing anonymous, aggregate 
			information about our users and subscribers, such as demographic, age and 
			online usage information. This allows us to provide content and offers that are 
			most relevant to our subscribers and users and to work more closely with 
			advertisers. We do not include any personally identifiable information of our 
			users in these reports.
		</p>
		<p>We use personal information so that we may display or send custom, 
			personalized content to our website visitors and to send newsletters, mail, 
			e-mails, features, promotional material, surveys and other updates, information 
			or offers to our users and subscribers. A user may, at any time, opt out of 
			receiving such information. We also use collected information to evaluate and 
			administer our products and services, fulfill customer requests, like 
			subscription and other orders, respond to any problems that may arise, such as 
			magazine delivery failures, difficulties in navigating our sites or accessing 
			certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products 
			and services are most popular with users.
		</p>
		<p>We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other 
			parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses 
			(unless you are a member who already has voluntarily provided your email 
			address) of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they 
			are sent, and do not share "send a friend" e-mail addresses with third parties.
		</p>
		<p>Of course, we use personal information to allow you to subscribe online or to 
			make product purchases at certain of our websites. Rest assured that we and our 
			technical and fulfillment agents and consultants follow careful procedures to 
			safeguard credit card data in connection with your transactions.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="3">HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
		<p>Personal information is available to Primedia and its technical and 
			fulfillment agents and consultants who make this site and our publications, 
			products and services available to you. Anonymous information is available to 
			our advertisers, sponsors and promotional and business partners. We share your 
			personal information with third parties only as described below.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Primedia and Its Agents.</em></strong> Primedia may access both 
			anonymous, aggregate demographic data and any personal information you provide 
			for internal marketing purposes, including sending you notices of subscription 
			renewal deadlines, new publications, services or products we offer likely to be 
			of interest, and filling subscription and other orders. To facilitate 
			subscriptions and orders, Primedia will cache your order information, and 
			create an authorization with a merchant account (i.e., your credit card 
			company). There are many companies who may be required to assist Primedia in 
			making its publications, products and web sites available to you. Web host 
			firms, technical and database consultants, advertising agencies, and 
			fulfillment firms, including firms assisting us in offering contests and 
			promotions, may have access to personally identifiable information in the 
			course of making our products and services available. All companies working for 
			Primedia must comply with our information collection, use and disclosure 
			policies, and are not permitted to sell your information to third parties or to 
			use it except as authorized by us and you, or as permitted or required by law.
		</p>
		<p><strong><em>Participating Vendors</em></strong>. Some of our sites offer 
			opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On 
			sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will 
			also give participating manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers or distributors 
			the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you 
			order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the 
			information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that 
			information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they 
			provide. Primedia is not responsible for their privacy policies, and urges you 
			to inquire about their information practices. In addition, all vendors will 
			receive the same anonymous, aggregate data that our advertisers do.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Credit Card Companies.</em></strong> As in any transaction, your 
			credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the 
			vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. Primedia will not otherwise 
			provide any personal data to your credit card company.
		</p>
		<p><strong><em>Advertisers, Sponsors and Promotional and Business Partners.</em></strong>
			We share anonymous, aggregate demographic information (such as gender, age, 
			income, hobbies, interests, etc.), and anonymous information obtained from 
			cookies and similar technologies, with our advertisers, sponsors, promotional 
			and business partners, and with participating vendors at sites offering online 
			sales opportunities. No personally identifiable information is disclosed to any 
			of these third parties in providing these reports. Credit card numbers, bank 
			account numbers, and passwords are not shared with advertisers, sponsors or 
			promotional partners, and are only shared with specific vendors with whom you 
			place an online order.</p>
		<p>Offline and online contact information is handled differently. As is customary 
			in the publications business, offline contact information is shared with third 
			parties who may send you offers or information about their products or 
			services. <strong>You must opt-out if you do not wish to receive information from 
				us or third parties by mail. </strong>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Your e-mail address is not shared with third parties unless you opt-in 
				to receiving information from third parties.</strong> In other words, we may 
			extend e-mail offers to users or subscribers on behalf of our business partners 
			about a particular product or service that may be of interest to you, but only 
			if you have indicated that you would like to receive those offers. If you wish 
			to receive such offers, we do not share or disclose your name or e-mail address 
			to those business partners, but will send you the information or offers on 
			their behalf. As result, although Primedia may receive a fee from our business 
			partners for this service, Primedia sends all the offers so that your personal 
			information is never shared with any outside third party. Of course, you may 
			opt out of receiving those offers at any time.
		</p>
		<p>Sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to receive e-mail offers 
			from third parties not affiliated with Primedia. If you decide to accept these 
			offers, we will provide, with your consent, your contact information to the 
			third party. At our websites, visitors will also have opportunities to sign up 
			directly with certain advertisers and sponsors to enter contests or 
			sweepstakes, receive e-mail updates, or to receive information directly from 
			them. Third party vendors and advertisers will also use technical and other 
			consultants. We urge visitors to carefully review the privacy policies of these 
			firms. Primedia is not responsible for the privacy policies and procedures of 
			any third party.</p>
		<p>You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or 
			otherwise, online in any community area (whether through Primedia's websites or 
			any other service available online), that information can be collected and used 
			by others. For example, if you use chat, forums, bulletin boards or message 
			boards, or if you post personal information online (such as your e-mail 
			address), you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Primedia has no 
			control over this use of your personal information.
		</p>
		<p><strong><em>Important Note</em></strong></p>
		<p>We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or 
			consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct 
			investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect 
			the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our 
			visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal 
			investigation.
		</p>
		<p><strong><a name="5">HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</a></strong>
		</p>
		<p>Your Web browser offers so-called "cookies" which, if you allow their use, 
			store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies 
			do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore 
			cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which 
			of our features you like best. Cookies also enable us to customize our content 
			according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline 
			cookies by modifying your browser and our websites are viewable even if you 
			disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, 
			some advanced and customized features or offerings will not be available to 
			you. Our third party advertisers may also use cookies.
		</p>
		<p><strong><a name="6">HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS?</a></strong>
		</p>
		<p>Some of our Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, 
			which are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users 
			who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We also may 
			include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to 
			count how many messages have been opened and acted upon. Web beacons are not 
			used to access your personally identifiable information but they are a 
			technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web 
			beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, 
			time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web 
			beacon resides. Some of our Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there 
			by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our 
			advertising campaigns.
		</p>
		<p><strong><a name="7">WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</a></strong></p>
		<p>Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by outside 
			companies. These ads contain cookies and may also contain Web beacons. Unlike 
			cookies and Web beacons used by Primedia in content it controls at its Web 
			sites, cookies or Web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our 
			advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use reputable 
			third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within 
			our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable 
			information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in 
			serving advertisements to you. They may share anonymous information with their 
			clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP 
			address, etc. DoubleClick is our third party ad server. If you would like to 
			know more about their information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, 
			please see <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy">http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy</a>.
		</p>
		<p><strong><a name="8">HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</a></strong></p>
		<p>We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to customer 
			satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your contact 
			information or change your preferences.</p>
		<p>1. If you have an online account at one of our websites, you may be able to 
			log on and update or change your contact or account information. Check the site 
			for further information.
			<br>
			2. You may unsubscribe to any of our online e-mail updates by following the 
			unsubscribe instructions in the body of any message.<br>
			3. You may write to us and update your contact information or ask that we not 
			share your personal contact information with third parties at: Primedia, Inc., 
			c/o Privacy Coordinator, 745 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10151. In those 
			instances, we will retain your information in a "do not promote" file in our 
			database.
			<br>
			4. You may also contact us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@primedia.com">privacypolicy@primedia.com</a>.
		</p>
		<p>We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests 
			promptly, but you may still receive promotional information from us by mail for 
			up to 60 days due to printing and mailing schedules, and up to 10 days for 
			e-mail.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="9">SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</a></strong>
		</p>
		<p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, 
			such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access 
			during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard 
			industry practices internally and with our service providers suitable to the 
			degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of 
			your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in 
			this policy.
			<br>
			Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created 
			when you registered at one of our websites where this feature is offered. The 
			confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime 
			by following the instructions at the website where you registered.
			<br>
			Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when 
			maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions cannot be assured. 
			Primedia employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic 
			communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those 
			Primedia employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this 
			information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure 
			environments. To maintain the highest level of security, we conduct internal 
			reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Remember, however, that 
			any personal information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available 
			to anyone.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="10">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</a></strong>
		</p>
		<p>Most of our publications and web sites are intended for adults. Some web sites 
			and publications, however, are intended for teens 13 and older but may include 
			features or material that may be appealing to children under the age of 13. 
			Primedia is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children 
			who visit our Web sites. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
			online from children under 13 and have adopted techniques to age-screen users 
			on our teen-oriented sites to ensure compliance with this Privacy Policy and 
			the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its 
			accompanying regulations establish United States federal law that protects the 
			privacy of children using the Internet. Many of our sites include chat rooms, 
			bulletin boards and other features that we believe are unsuitable for children 
			under 13 and which are not necessarily monitored. We encourage all parents to 
			talk to their kids about online safety and to monitor their children's use of 
			the Internet.
		</p>
		<p><strong><a name="11">LINKS</a></strong></p>
		<p>Primedia may offer links to or from Web sites it controls to other sites 
			within the Primedia family as well as to sites operated by third parties. We 
			offer links to third party sites so that you can conveniently visit our vendors 
			and advertisers or locate other content likely to be of interest. We are not 
			responsible for the content, practices or policies of sites operated by third 
			parties and urge you to inquire about them before providing any 
			personally-identifiable information.</p>
		<p><strong><a name="12">CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE</a></strong>
