<h1><font color="#A50021">Privacy Statement</font></h1>

<p>The following is a statement about our privacy policy concerning the personal information we collect about you.</p>

<p>It is the policy of Dennis Publishing, the owner of this site, to act in accordance with current legislation and to meet the current best practice on the Internet.  Our aim is to be responsible, relevant and secure when using your data.</p>

<p>In order for you to use this site and to enable us to provide you with the best possible experience we ask you to "Register".  We ask you to submit contact information such as your name, postcode, email address and (optional) mobile phone number.   This is all that is required to become a member of our sites. Our registration goes on to ask for more personal data. This secondary stage is entirely optional and is clearly flagged as such. We also at this stage ask you if we can contact you with offers from ourselves or our ad partners, and it what ways we can communicate with you.</p>

<p>Basic registration information allows us to provide you with a better experience on our web sites.  For example, it allows you to sign up for newsletters, enter competitions, and take part in our forums without having to login each time.</p>

<p>Whenever you provide such personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy. We endeavour at all times to keep your data accurate and secure, and to honour your data preferences with regard to receipt of email, mobile messaging and mobile telephone calls.</p>

<p>Our web sites allow you to view the personal information you have provided to us and amend/delete it and your data preferences at any time. In addition every communication from us to you will include an option for you to stop receiving that form of communication.</p>

<p>We automatically log some personal data, via cookies, and we link that information with personal data you have supplied to us. We also link data from third parties, such as Experian, to flesh out the demographic profile of our users. Experian data is statistically modelled from UK postcodes and the electoral register. As such it is not specific about you, but is statistically accurate over a broad base of the UK population.</p>

<p>We collect data for the following purposes: Technical administration of the web site, to enhance your experience of the site, research and development, customer service, marketing, ad targeting and trading in personal data to selected partners. All of the above are subject to your stated preferences.</p>

<p>Where your data is used as targeting criteria for web advertising - for example you may see a particular banner ad as a result of your age, gender or demographic profile - this happens anonymously. That is, the advertiser does not have access to your data and nor does the ad server company which delivers the ads. The ad targeting procedure is carried out using software on our web servers such that only you know which ads have been delivered to you.</p>

<p>Where your data is used by an advertising partner to send you targeted electronic communications, such as email or mobile messages, the sender is expressly prohibited from viewing the data at the personal level and may not retain the data once the communication has been sent. We use only reputable advertisers and have procedures in place to prevent re-use of data once the contracted communication has occurred. But we cannot absolutely ensure that your data is never abused by advertising partners and cannot accept responsibility for the fraudulent use/abuse of user data by third parties. Basic registration on our sites requires only your name and contact details to be provided. We would ask you NOT to provide the optional personal data requested on page 2 of our registration if you feel that personal details such as your age, gender, job title, salary and family composition are particularly sensitive.</p>

<p>If we wish to use your personal data for new purposes, we will  ask for your consent to such use in advance.</p>
