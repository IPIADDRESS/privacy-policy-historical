In order to do that, we may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not gather any Personal Information about you; they simply track where you travel on the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web sites and what you look at. (Cookies may, however, store your login name which allows you access to our online forums.) In doing so, a cookie may enable AutoCricket Corporation U.S. to relate your use of the Web sites to Personal Information that has already been submitted. Many other web sites use cookies for very similar purposes.<br><br>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will generally not interfere with your use of a AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web site. However, refusal of a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using features of a site that require registration. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies.<br><br>We may also use web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow AutoCricket Corporation U.S. and our service providers and business partners to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future site development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. We may also use web beacons within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.<br><br>To the extent that the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web Site carries advertising by third parties, AutoCricket Corporation U.S.'s Web advertising technology companies.

Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us, e.g., another Web site or search engine. Our server cannot automatically record your name or address, but we may link this information with your Personal Information.<br><br><strong>How is the information used?</strong><br><br>We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web sites to fulfill a specific purpose.
