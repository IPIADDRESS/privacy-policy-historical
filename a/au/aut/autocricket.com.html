<h2>Site Usage Information</h2>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests. In order to do that, we may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not gather any Personal Information about you; they simply track where you travel on the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web sites and what you look at. (Cookies may, however, store your login name which allows you access to our online forums.) In doing so, a cookie may enable AutoCricket Corporation U.S. to relate your use of the Web sites to Personal Information that has already been submitted. Many other web sites use cookies for very similar purposes.<br><br>

Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will generally not interfere with your use of a AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web site. However, refusal of a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using features of a site that require registration. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties' policies.<br><br>

We may also use web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow AutoCricket Corporation U.S. and our service providers and business partners to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future site development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. We may also use web beacons within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.<br><br>

To the extent that the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web Site carries advertising by third parties, AutoCricket Corporation U.S.'s Web advertising technology companies. The non-personally identifiable information collected by these companies, for example, about your visits to this and other web sites is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it. For additional information on the information that is collected by AutoCricket Corporation U.S.'s Web advertising technology vendors and to know your choices about not having this information used by them, please click on their names or visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.<br><br>

<h2>IP Address</h2>

Our server automatically collects data about your server's domain address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you're on the Web. When you request pages from AutoCricket Corporation U.S., our servers log your IP Address. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us, e.g., another Web site or search engine. Our server cannot automatically record your name or address, but we may link this information with your Personal Information.<br><br>

<h2>How is the information used?</h2>

We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web sites to fulfill a specific purpose. For example, Personal Information will be used to enter you in a sweepstakes or contest, to send an e-newsletter or fulfill a product or service order. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. In addition, we may send you e-mail notices about products, services, companies and events that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from us by following the instructions in the e-mail you receive from us or sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided in the Right to Opt-Out section section above. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including our other Web sites, print publications and third parties, and such merged information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

We may use cookies to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of our Web Sites you have visited. We may also match information obtained from cookies with data provided by you or collected by third parties. We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users. This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests. We also provide the analysis of our users (as a group, of course) to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.<br><br>

AutoCricket Corporation U.S. uses IP Addresses for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider (i.e. AOL, Earthlink, etc.).<br><br>

<h2>Does AutoCricket Corporation U.S. share Personal Information and Site Usage information with others?</h2>

On the Site, AutoCricket Corporation U.S. may provide visitors an opportunity to receive offers from advertisers and other companies who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not at that time indicate a preference not to receive such offers, AutoCricket Corporation U.S. will from time to time provide your contact information to these entities so that they may send you these offers. If you change your mind and no longer want us to share your contact information with others, send an email to the email address provided in the Right to Opt Out section above.<br><br>


If you provide information to AutoCricket Corporation U.S. in connection with a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion that is being conducted with another entity or Web site, the information you provide may be used for the purpose for which you provided the information and may be shared with that partner. Your Personal Information may also be used for other purposes that may be disclosed at the time your information is requested.<br><br>

AutoCricket Corporation U.S. reserves the right to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in and use of the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web sites and AutoCricket Corporation U.S. e-mails. AutoCricket Corporation U.S. may disclose such analyses to advertisers or other third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.<br><br>

<h2>E-mail</h2>

If you contact AutoCricket Corporation U.S. by e-mail, you should be aware that e-mail transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by e-mail in transit. AutoCricket Corporation U.S. will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during transmission.<br><br>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

We may use third party partners to help operate our Web sites and deliver our products and services, and may share your information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for or through this Site or for our business (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf).<br><br>

<h2>Legal Authorities</h2>

We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas, at our discretion. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other AutoCricket Corporation U.S. site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.<br><br>

<h2>Business Transfer</h2>

In the event that AutoCricket Corporation U.S. or substantially all of its assets or the assets related to this particular Site are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.<br><br>

<h2>Consent to Transfer</h2>

You also acknowledge that governmental and other authorities in the United States and other countries and territories to which such information is transferred may have a legal right to obtain access to or the disclosure of such information.<br><br>

<h2>Access to other sites through the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Sites</h2>

When you are on an AutoCricket Corporation U.S. site you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other sites not operated by AutoCricket Corporation U.S.. These sites, some of which are AutoCricket Corporation U.S. advertisers and partners, may collect personally identifiable information about you. AutoCricket Corporation U.S. does not control sites that are operated by others and is not responsible for the information practices of these sites and this privacy statement does not address the information practices of those web sites or advertisers.<br><br>

<h2>AutoCricket Corporation U.S.'s Right to Change this Policy</h2>

AutoCricket Corporation U.S. reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other AutoCricket Corporation U.S. policy or practice, at any time and will notify users of such changes or updates by posting them on the Site and/or by additional means as determined to be appropriate under the circumstances. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site


<h2>Security/Enforcement</h2>

AutoCricket Corporation U.S. will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web sites.
