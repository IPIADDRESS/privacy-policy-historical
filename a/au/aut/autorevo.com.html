			AutoRevo has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to 
			demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the AutoRevo web 
			site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important 
			information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement 
			as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination 
			practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide 
			notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the 
			change taking effect. Collected Information: We require customers who register 
			to use the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact 
			information, such as their name, company name, address, ph one number, and 
			e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as 
			billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within 
			the organization that will be using the Services. At the time you express 
			interest in attaining additional information, or when you register for the 
			service, we may also ask for additional personal information, such as title, 
			department name, fax number, or additional company information, such as annual 
			revenues, number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing 
			this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update 
			or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the Website 
			and editing their Account Information within Admin. Customers can view their 
			updated profile to confirm their edits have been made.
			<br>
			<br>
			AutoRevo uses the information that we collect to set up Services for 
			individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact 
			customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Services 
			that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, 
			such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive an email 
			newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any 
			personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third 
			parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such 
			information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@AutoRevo.com. 
			Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when 
			registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We 
			may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and 
			will send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared 
			and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing 
			support@AutoRevo.com at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer 
			registers for the Service.
			<br>
			<br>
			Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as 
			provided for in the AutoRevo Master Subscription Agreement, we do not disclose 
			to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing 
			information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the 
			qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services. This billing 
			information is not used by AutoRevo for marketing or promotional purposes. 
			AutoRevo uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. 
			This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not 
			permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the 
			sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content 
			providers, may provide content on the web Site but they are not permitted to 
			collect any information nor does AutoRevo share any user information with these 
			parties.
			<br>
			<br>
			Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information 
			("Data"). AutoRevo will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any 
			such Data except as provided in the AutoRevo Master Subscription Agreement, or 
			as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or 
			accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or 
			suspected violation of the Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required 
			by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the 
			confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.
			<br>
			<br>
			AutoRevo may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of 
			the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help 
			diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly 
			improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze 
			non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our 
			visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
			<br>
			<br>
			If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our 
			site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. AutoRevo will 
			automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. 
			AutoRevo does not store this information.
			<br>
			<br>
			Cookies:
			<br>
			When you interact with the AutoRevo Website we strive to make that experience 
			easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a 
			cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a 
			computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors 
			have visited the Site previously.
			<br>
			<br>
			Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize 
			your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to AutoRevo, either by 
			responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a 
			14-day Test Drive, you remain anonymous to AutoRevo. Cookies come in two 
			flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an 
			online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser 
			software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer 
			after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such 
			information as a unique identifier for your browser.
			<br>
			<br>
			AutoRevo uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the 
			system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information 
			allows AutoRevo to process your online transactions and requests. Session 
			cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in 
			and are required in order to use the AutoRevo application. AutoRevo uses 
			persistent cookies, that only AutoRevo can read and use, to identify the fact 
			that you are a AutoRevo customer or prior AutoRevo Website visitor (whatever 
			the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and 
			confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, 
			we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who 
			disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse 
			our Website but will not be able to successfully use our service.
			<br>
			<br>
			Third-Party Sites:
			<br>
			The Site contains links to other web sites. AutoRevo is not responsible for the 
			privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and 
			visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to 
			understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may 
			be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user 
			to keep such information private and confidential.
			<br>
			<br>
			Security:
			<br>
			Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, 
			misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. AutoRevo implements an 
			advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session 
			identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a 
			firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from 
			outside intruders. Finally, AutoRevo provides unique user names and passwords 
			that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help 
			prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate 
			use of Data.
			<br>
			<br>
			Opt-Out Policy:
			<br>
			AutoRevo offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use 
			information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or 
			ordering Services, you change your mind about receiving information from us or 
			about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying 
			your new choice. Simply send your request to support@AutoRevo.com.
