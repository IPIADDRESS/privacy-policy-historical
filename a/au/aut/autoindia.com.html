        AUTOINDIA.COM PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
        Effective Date: <strong>September 16th, 2005<br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
        AutoIndia.com Online Pvt Ltd respects the privacy of visitors to our website. 
        We value our customers and are committed to protecting your privacy, as 
        well as safeguarding the information we receive and maintain about you. 
        We do not sell information about you to others. In this document, we explain 
        how we use information you supply us via the AutoIndia.com website. Please 
        read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what information 
        we collect through our website and what we do with that information. This 
        Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through 
        the AutoIndia.com website and does not describe the ways in which we may 
        collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other 
        than our website. If you have questions about this Privacy Statement, 
        please contact Customer Service. 
        <p><strong>THE INFORMATION AUTOINDIA.COM COLLECTS</strong><br>
          Tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our website 
          and review our email newsletters and other email messages and Information 
          supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car for sale, perform 
          a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or initiate 
          a transaction. Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our 
          website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our 
          site by third parties, may be gathering information, as well, through 
          processes we don't control. <br>
          If you provide us your email address, we may email you about our website 
          or our services, or to inquire about your experience using our website 
          or sites operated by others. From time to time, we'll also send you 
          emails that may include automotive information, special promotions and 
          other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. Though 
          we hope you'll find these communications informative and useful, if 
          you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions 
          included in each email. And you can opt-out of receiving these types 
          of commercial offers at all by indicating, when you list a car for sale 
          or inquire about a car listed on our website, that you'd prefer not 
          to receive these communications. <br>
          To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide 
          limited information about themselves and their interests so that we 
          can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to 
          help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what kind 
          of car you're looking for and your zip code. We ask you to provide this 
          information when you perform a search. We use this information to help 
          you find the car you're looking for. If you find a listing that interests 
          you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we'll 
          share with the seller the contact information you supply through our 
          online "Email Seller" form. If you do not wish to share your 
          email address or other contact information with the sellers who advertise 
          on our website, you should not use our "Email Seller" contact 
          form. Many of the dealer listings that appear on our website include 
          toll-free telephone numbers that can be used to contact the dealership 
          that is selling the advertised vehicle. If you call a dealer using one 
          of these toll-free numbers, we may provide the dealer with the date, 
          time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from which your 
          call originated. If you wish to contact a dealership that advertises 
          on our website without disclosing this information, please contact the 
          dealer by email or by dialing its local telephone number. When you list 
          a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can 
          be contacted by potential buyers. We may also ask for your credit card 
          number and the expiration date on your card. We use this information 
          to create your ad and to process your payment. <br>
          To help us tailor our website to the needs and interests of our visitors, 
          we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie, 
          a small entry in text file, on your hard drive. The cookie contains 
          an ID number that allows us to track the pages you've visited. We aggregate 
          this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall 
          visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our site 
          by making it more responsive to the needs of our users. We also use 
          cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly during a single 
          visit to our site. Cookies don't reveal personal information; the only 
          personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply 
          yourself. Cookies can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our 
          advertisers and those who provide products and/or services through our 
          site may also assign their own cookies, a process we don't control. 
          We don't have access to these cookies or to any information they contain. 
          The help function on most web browsers contains information on how to 
          set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable 
          cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be 
          able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available 
          to other visitors. Our "Find Your Car" feature, for example, 
          won't work properly if you configure your browser not to accept cookies. 
          Our web server automatically collects limited information about your 
          computer configuration when you visit our site, including the type of 
          browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution 
          of your computer monitor, the website that referred you, and your IP 
          address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers 
          connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such 
          as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also 
          use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting 
          purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who you are.) We use this 
          information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as 
          possible. <br>
          From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our 
          website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we'll ask 
          you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, 
          and email address). Among other things, we'll need this information 
          to contact you if you win, and we may use this information for marketing 
          purposes. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest 
          or sweepstakes, which we'll identify in the contest rules. We may also 
          share this information with shipping or fulfillment companies or other 
          third-party service providers who are responsible for some aspects of 
          administering our promotions, such as conducting drawings, and/or delivering 
          prizes to winners. If you don't want us to collect the information requested 
          in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to 
          co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes. <br>
          <strong><br>
          DISCLOSURE AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong><br>
          When we present information to our advertisers-to help them understand 
          our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website--it 
          is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various 
          pages within our site. Any credit card information you may provide to 
          us is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry--standard 
          secure socket layer (SSL) encryption and is stored on our secure servers. 
          We use your credit card information only to bill you for the products 
          and services you order from us. We don't share your credit card information 
          with anyone, except as may be necessary to process your transactions 
          or comply with law. We may collect, or have a third party collect on 
          our behalf, aggregated statistical information about how visitors use 
          and navigate around our site, such as the number of users who visit 
          various pages within the site, what they click on, whether they scroll 
          up or down on particular pages, fill out forms, etc. This aggregated 
          information does not identify you personally. We use this information 
          to improve our site. We may also disclose this aggregated information 
          to third parties. </p>
        <p><strong>LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS</strong><br>
          To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we feature some products 
          and services that come from other providers. Our finance, insurance, 
          warranty, and inspection services, for example, are made available through 
          cooperative arrangements with companies that specialize in providing 
          such services. We share with these third parties such information as 
          is necessary for them to provide the products or services. Of course, 
          our site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products 
          and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't 
          control. When you access another website or purchase products or services 
          or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information 
          you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the 
          site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When 
          you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services 
          through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed 
          by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services. 
          The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find 
          the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either 
          from their site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or 
          services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more 
          information. </p>
        <p>Information we gather on our website is stored within AutoIndia.com-controlled 
          databases (or databases hosted on our behalf) on servers maintained

          is secured for transmission over the Internet using industry-standard

          or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the 
          security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information 
          you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the 
          Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a vehicle listing 
          is available to anyone with Internet access. </p>
        <p><strong>OTHER DISCLOSURES</strong><br>
          We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release 
          is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, 
          or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, 
          our customers, the public or AutoIndia.com. As our business grows, we 
          may buy or sell various assets. To ensure that the email marketing preferences 
          of our visitors are honored, we may share email addresses collected 
          on our website with advertisers (or their designated agents) for the 
          limited purpose of identifying and removing from our distribution lists 
          and/or the advertiser's distribution lists the email addresses of any 
          persons who have "unsubscribed" or otherwise indicated a preference 
          not to receive commercial electronic mail messages from, or transmitted 
          on behalf of, the relevant advertiser. In the unlikely event that AutoIndia.com, 
          one of its business units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired 
          by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred 
          assets. We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings 
          database, for example) and to analyze the data they find there or aggregate 
          it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours. Though 
          some of the information in our databases may be personally identifying 
          (such as the contact information included in a vehicle listing), we'll 
          only allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information 
          that is otherwise publicly available on our website. When we use other 
          companies to help us operate our site or improve the services we offer 
          to you, we may provide them with information about our visitors that 
          is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that these 
          companies commit to use the information only to perform the services 
          that we request. </p>
        <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong><br>
          The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy 
          at some point in the future, we'll post the changes to this Privacy 
          Statement on this website and update the reference to the effective 
          date to reflect the date of the amendment. By visiting AutoIndia.com, 
          you agree that your visit, and any dispute over privacy, is governed
