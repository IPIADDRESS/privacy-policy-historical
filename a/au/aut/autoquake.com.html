		Privacy Policy
	</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for Autoquake.com.
		Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy
		to learn about the ways in which we use and protect your personal
		information. This Privacy Policy applies to the www.autoquake.com
		website (the "Site").
	</p>
	<p>
		This policy covers how Autoquake.com treats personal information that
		Autoquake.com collects and receives, including information related to
		your past use of Autoquake.com's products and services. By accepting
		this Privacy Policy and the Visitors Agreement, you expressly consent
		to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner
		prescribed in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all these
		terms and conditions, please do not provide us with any information
		and do not use Autoquake.com.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Effective Date: August 31, 2006.</strong>
	</p>
	<h2>
		1. Information We Collect
	</h2>
	<p>
		Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you
		with a safe, efficient, and personalized experience. We only collect
		personal information about you that we consider necessary for this
		purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
		In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or
		revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us
		your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose
		to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and
		identity information, financial information and other personal
		information as indicated by the Site. Where possible, we indicate
		which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always
		have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use a
		particular service or feature.
	</p>
	<p>
		Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial
		information, such as, but not limited to, credit card details if you
		are registering to sell on the Site or to registering to use our
		financial services. We use this financial information to help verify
		your name, address, and other information. We may also use this
		information to charge you for your use of our services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We automatically collect and process certain information based upon
		your use of the Site. We use this information to conduct internal
		research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to
		better understand and serve you and our community. This information
		may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on
		the Site or not), which links on our site you follow, browser
		information, and your IP address.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of
		the Site. "Cookies" are pieces of information, small files placed on
		your hard drive by your web browser between visits of our site that
		assist us in providing customised services and to help promote safer
		trading. We also offer certain features that are only available
		through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter
		your password less frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies
		can also help us provide information which we tailor to your
		interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are
		automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session
		using the Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your
		browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use
		certain features on the Site and you may be required to re-enter your
		password more frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies don't
		reveal personal information; the only personal information a cookie
		can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies can't read
		unrelated data off your hard drive.
	</p>
	<p>
		To help us keep track of how many users are visiting particular pages
		within our website, and how many users are accessing particular
		listings that we distribute, we may place a small file, called a web
		beacon, on some of our pages and on some of the listings we
		distribute. These web beacons allow us to track the number of users
		that view our pages and our listings, but they don't reveal any
		personally identifying information about individual users.
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on
		certain pages of the Site that are placed by third parties. For
		example, if you view a web page or an ad created by a user or partner,
		there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control
		the use of cookies by third parties.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge,
		we collect some additional information, including but not limited to a
		billing address, a credit card number and a credit card expiration
		date. We do not store credit card information except, for reference
		purposes only; we may store the last 4 digits of credit card numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or
		if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your
		activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information
		into a file specific to you.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you register for Autoquake.com (a) on another web site, or (b) use
		a web site providing a service for Autoquake.com, or (c) a web site
		that helps facilitate your activity on Autoquake.com, that web site
		may provide personal information about you and your transactions back
		to Autoquake.com.
	</p>
	<h2>
		2. Our Use of Your Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		We use information in the files we maintain about you, and other
		information we obtain from your current and past activities on the
		Site, to resolve disputes, provide customer support, troubleshoot
		problems and enforce our Visitors Agreement and policies. At times, we
		may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve
		disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to
		identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.
	</p>
	<p>
		To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide
		limited information about themselves and their interests so that we
		can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to
		help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what
		kind of car you're looking for and your postal code. We ask you to
		provide this information when you perform a search. We use this
		information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you find a
		listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email
		through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact
		information you supply through our online "Email Seller" form.
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about
		you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site
		usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customise the
		Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and
		better tailor it to meet your needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver
		information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your
		interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative
		notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of
		the Site. By accepting the Visitors Agreement and reading this Privacy
		Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.
	</p>
	<h2>
		3. An Important Note About Children
	</h2>
	<p>
		Our services are not available to children and we ask that persons
		under the age of 18 do not submit any personal information to us. If
		you are under 18 years old, you can use this service only in
		conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or guardian.
	</p>
	<h2>
		4. Our Disclosure of Your Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		As a matter of policy, Autoquake.com will never sell or rent your
		personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes
		without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some
		of the ways that we may disclose your personally identifiable
		information:
	</p>
	<p>
		(1) We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally
		identifiable information and disclose such information in a
		non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third
		parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these
		situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that
		could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as
		your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank
		account number are never disclosed to third party advertisers.
	</p>
	<p>
		(2) Autoquake.com cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well
		as other third parties, to enforce laws and third party rights, such
		as intellectual property rights and laws relating to fraud. Therefore,
		in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other
		government officials such as a the Data Protection Act 1998 form
		relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, or
		other activity that may expose us or you to legal liability, we can
		(and you authorise us to) disclose personal information such as name,
		address, telephone number, email address, User ID history, and bidding
		and listing history about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe
		necessary or appropriate. Further, we can (and you authorise us to)
		disclose your User ID, name, address, telephone number, email address,
		and company name to Autoquake.com under a confidentiality agreement as
		we in our sole discretion believe necessary to share information in
		order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal
		activity, suspected fraud, situations involving potential physical
		threats to any person, violations of our Visitors Agreement,
		intellectual property infringement or other unlawful activities.
	</p>
	<p>
		We respond to verified requests (subpoenas, search warrants, court
		orders, or other legal process) from law enforcement or other
		government officials relating to a criminal investigation of alleged
		illegal activity, or to establish or exercise our legal right or
		defense against legal claims.
	</p>
	<p>
		(3) At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect,
		including Personal Information, safely to help us improve our products
		and our Web site . In addition, if you order a product or service from
		us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third
		parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third
		parties are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in
		any way. To help us do this, we may measure the effectiveness of our
		web presence by determining what you clicked on to get to our site. To
		help us do this, we may measure statistics to personalize your Web
		site experience, as well as to evaluate statistics about usage of the
		Web site. Information about your computer may also be collected and
		linked to your Personal Information. This is to ensure that our Web
		site presents the best web experience for visitors, and that they are
		effective information resources.
	</p>
	<p>
		We cannot ensure that all of your communications with Autoquake.com
		and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed
		in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example,
		third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or
		private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information
		that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry
		standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, and
		you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information
		or communications with Autoquake.com will always remain private.
	</p>
	<p>
		We reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor
		in interest that acquires the right to such information by acquiring
		the Service, acquiring Autoquake.com or substantially all of
		Autoquake.com's assets, or merging with Autoquake.com. In any of these
		events, Autoquake.com will notify you before information about you is
		transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
	</p>
	<h2>
		5. Links
	</h2>
	<p>
		This site contains links to other sites. We will make every effort to
		link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for
		privacy. We are not responsible for any other Websites, their
		respective privacy practices, or privacy policies to find out how they
		treat your personal information. When you visit or access any
		third-party site, you are subject to that site's privacy policy and
		terms and conditions.
	</p>
	<h2>
		6. Control of Your Password
	</h2>
	<p>
		You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and
		password, including those actions that result in fees being charged to
		your account. Therefore we strongly recommend that you do not disclose
		your Autoquake.com password to any third parties. If you choose to
		share your User ID and password or your information with third parties
		when necessary for you to do so for them to provide you with
		additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with
		your User ID and password and therefore you should review that third
		party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may
		lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information
		and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
		Whenever there is any risk that your password or account has been
		compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your
		password as detailed in Section 6 below and check recent activity on
		your account.
	</p>

		7. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable
		Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		We offer you the ability to review and change the information you
		submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new
		information yourself or by sending us an email to
		<a href="mailto:privacy@autoquake.com">privacy@autoquake.com</a>. Upon
		your written request, we will deactivate your account, contact
		information, and financial information from our active databases. To
		make this request, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:privacy@autoquake.com">privacy@autoquake.com</a>. Such
		information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible in

		circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and
		enforce our Visitor Agreement. Further, such prior information is
		never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal
		constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you should
		not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will
		be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

		Marketing Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this
		page can opt out of receiving future marketing communications from
		these new categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions

		document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
		collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to
		other parties, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on the Site
		or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to
		their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To
		the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their
		own privacy policies. Since Autoquake.com does not control the privacy
		policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of
		that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you
		disclose your personal information to others.

		factors may lead to a security breach. If you have any questions about
		this, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:privacy@autoquake.com">privacy@autoquake.com</a>.
