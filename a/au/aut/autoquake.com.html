<p class="privacyCopy">Welcome to the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
for Autoquake. Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this
Privacy Policy to learn about the ways in which we use and protect your
personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to the
www.autoquake.com website (the "Site").</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">This policy covers how Autoquake treats personal
information that Autoquake collects and receives, including information
related to your past use of Autoquake's products and services. By
accepting this Privacy Policy and the Visitors Agreement, you expressly
consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the
manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all
these terms and conditions, please do not provide us with any
information and do not use Autoquake.</p>

<h2>Effective Date: August 31, 2006.</h2>

<div class="twoColSpanBox">

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p class="privacyCopy">Our primary goal in collecting personal
information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and personalized
experience. We only collect personal information about you that we
consider necessary for this purpose.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">In general, you can browse the Site without
telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about
yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not
anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you
to provide contact and identity information, financial information and
other personal information as indicated by the Site. Where possible, we
indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You
always have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use
a particular service or feature.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">Under some circumstances we may require some
additional financial information, such as, but not limited to, credit
card details if you are registering to sell on the Site or to
registering to use our financial services. We use this financial
information to help verify your name, address, and other information. We
may also use this information to charge you for your use of our
services.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">We automatically collect and process certain
information based upon your use of the Site. We use this information to
conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and
behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This
information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this
URL is on the Site or not), which links on our site you follow, browser
information, and your IP address.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">We use data collection devices such as "cookies"
on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are pieces of information, small
files placed on your hard drive by your web browser between visits of
our site that assist us in providing customised services and to help
promote safer trading. We also offer certain features that are only
available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you
to enter your password less frequently while you are using the Site.
Cookies can also help us provide information which we tailor to your
interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are
automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session using
the Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser
permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain
features on the Site and you may be required to re-enter your password
more frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies don't reveal
personal information; the only personal information a cookie can contain
is information you supply yourself. Cookies can't read unrelated data
off your hard drive.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">To help us keep track of how many users are
visiting particular pages within our website, and how many users are
accessing particular listings that we distribute, we may place a small
file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on some of the
listings we distribute. These web beacons allow us to track the number
of users that view our pages and our listings, but they don't reveal any
personally identifying information about individual users.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or
other similar devices on certain pages of the Site that are placed by
third parties. For example, if you view a web page or an ad created by a
user or partner, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We
do not control the use of cookies by third parties.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">If you establish a credit account with us to pay
the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, including
but not limited to a billing address, a credit card number and a credit
card expiration date. We do not store credit card information except,
for reference purposes only; we may store the last 4 digits of credit
card numbers.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">If you send us personal correspondence, such as
emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us
correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may
collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">If you register for Autoquake (a) on another web
site, or (b) use a web site providing a service for Autoquake, or (c) a
web site that helps facilitate your activity on Autoquake, that web site
may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to
Autoquake.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>



<h2>2. Our Use of Your Information</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">We use information in the files we maintain about
you, and other information we obtain from your current and past
activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, provide customer support,
troubleshoot problems and enforce our Visitors Agreement and policies.
At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or
resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to
identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">To make use of certain features on our site,
visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their
interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their
needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, we
need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your postal code.
We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search. We use
this information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you
find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email
through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information
you supply through our online "Email Seller" form.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">You agree that we may use personally identifiable
information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts,
to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and
customise the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve
the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">You agree that we may use your information to
contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are
targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements,
administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant
to your use of the Site. By accepting the Visitors Agreement and reading
this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.</p>


<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>





<h2>3. An Important Note About Children</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">Our services are not available to children and we
ask that persons under the age of 18 do not submit any personal
information to us. If you are under 18 years old, you can use this
service only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent
or guardian.</p>


<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>




<h2>4. Our Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">As a matter of policy, Autoquake will never sell
or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing
purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes
some of the ways that we may disclose your personally identifiable
information:</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">(1) We aggregate (gather up data across all user
accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such
information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and
other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in
these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information
that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such
as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank
account number are never disclosed to third party advertisers.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">(2) Autoquake cooperates with law enforcement
inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws and third
party rights, such as intellectual property rights and laws relating to
fraud. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement
or other government officials such as a the Data Protection Act 1998
form relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity,
or other activity that may expose us or you to legal liability, we can
(and you authorise us to) disclose personal information such as name,
address, telephone number, email address, User ID history, and bidding
and listing history about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe
necessary or appropriate. Further, we can (and you authorise us to)
disclose your User ID, name, address, telephone number, email address,
and company name to Autoquake under a confidentiality agreement as we in
our sole discretion believe necessary to share information in order to
prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activity,
suspected fraud, situations involving potential physical threats to any
person, violations of our Visitors Agreement, intellectual property
infringement or other unlawful activities.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">We respond to verified requests (subpoenas,
search warrants, court orders, or other legal process) from law
enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal
investigation of alleged illegal activity, or to establish or exercise
our legal right or defense against legal claims.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">(3) At times we may retain third parties to
analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, safely to help
us improve our products and our Web site . In addition, if you order a
product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to
suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or
service. These third parties are not authorized by us to use your
Personal Information in any way. To help us do this, we may measure the
effectiveness of our web presence by determining what you clicked on to
get to our site. To help us do this, we may measure statistics to
personalize your Web site experience, as well as to evaluate statistics
about usage of the Web site. Information about your computer may also be
collected and linked to your Personal Information. This is to ensure
that our Web site presents the best web experience for visitors, and
that they are effective information resources.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">We cannot ensure that all of your communications
with Autoquake and other personally identifiable information will never
be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For
example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information
that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry
standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, and you
should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or
communications with Autoquake will always remain private.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy">We reserve the right to transfer information
about you to a successor in interest that acquires the right to such
information by acquiring the Service, acquiring Autoquake or
substantially all of Autoquake's assets, or merging with Autoquake. In
any of these events, Autoquake will notify you before information about
you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>






<h2>5. Links</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">This site contains links to other sites. We will
make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards
and respect for privacy. We are not responsible for any other Websites,
their respective privacy practices, or privacy policies to find out how
they treat your personal information. When you visit or access any
third-party site, you are subject to that site's privacy policy and
terms and conditions.</p>


<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>







<h2>6. Control of Your Password</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">You are responsible for all actions taken with
your User ID and password, including those actions that result in fees
being charged to your account. Therefore we strongly recommend that you
do not disclose your Autoquake password to any third parties. If you
choose to share your User ID and password or your information with third
parties when necessary for you to do so for them to provide you with
additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with your
User ID and password and therefore you should review that third party's
privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose
substantial control over your personally identifiable information and
may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Whenever
there is any risk that your password or account has been compromised for
any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in
Section 6 below and check recent activity on your account.</p>

<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>

<h2>7. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable
Information</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">We offer you the ability to review and change the
information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in
the new information yourself or by sending us an email to <script>
			document.write("<a href=\""+privacyMAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("\" class=\"more\" target=\"_blank\">"+privacyAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("</a>");
			</script>. Upon your written request, we will deactivate your
account, contact information, and financial information from our active
databases. To make this request, please contact us at <script>
			document.write("<a href=\""+privacyMAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("\" class=\"more\" target=\"_blank\">"+privacyAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("</a>");
			</script>. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably
possible in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.

We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in
some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems
and enforce our Visitor Agreement. Further, such prior information is
never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal
constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you should
not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be
completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. New
categories of marketing communications may be added to the Marketing
Preferences page from time to time. Users who visit this page can opt
out of receiving future marketing communications from these new
categories or they can unsubscribe by following instructions contained
in the messages they receive.</p>

<h2>8. Other Information Collectors</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">Except as otherwise expressly included in this
Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of
information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your
information to other parties, whether they are bidders, buyers or
sellers on the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different
rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you
disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers,
they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since Autoquake does not
control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the
privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions
before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>


<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">Autoquake has implemented reasonable security
measures in order to protect both personal information from loss, misuse
and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration. We limit access to
personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably
need that information to provide products or services to you. Our
employees are made aware of and are accountable for compliance with
these procedures. All Member accounts are password-protected. We go to
great lengths to protect the account information that you have provided
us. Access to this information is limited to only the Autoquake
employees who need it in order to perform their job function, such as
customer service representatives. However, please note that we do not
guarantee account security. Hardware or software failure and other
factors may lead to a security breach. If you have any questions about
this, please contact us at <script>
			document.write("<a href=\""+privacyMAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("\" class=\"more\" target=\"_blank\">"+privacyAddr().replace(/\+/g,""));
			document.write("</a>");
			</script>.</p>


<p class="privacyCopy"><a href="#top" class="more">back to top</a></p>


<h2>10. Changes in our Privacy Policy</h2>
<p class="privacyCopy">As we update and expand our services, this
Privacy Policy may change to accurately reflects the regulatory
environment and our own data collection and disclosure practices so it
is your responsibility to refer back to it periodically.</p>
