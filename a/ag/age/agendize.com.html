						<h3>AgendiZe Privacy Policy</h3>
						

<p>At AgendiZe we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a visitor to AgendiZe.com, you prefer to control your own personal information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information and preferences when you visit certain areas of www.agendize.com, create a free trial account, download free software, request information, or subscribe to AgendiZe Newsletter.</p>

<p>We will guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the content and services that we provide on AgendiZe.com are always tailored to your current, designated preferences.</p>

<p>When you provide AgendiZe with your name (or alias), e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number, and you do not 'opt out,' AgendiZe and AgendiZe representatives and affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information, classes, new services, and other AgendiZe information. Representatives and affiliates may include value-added resellers and authorized training partners. Beyond its representatives and affiliates, AgendiZe does not offer or allow the selling of any user-provided information to third parties.</p>

<p>AgendiZe respects the rights users give us when opting to receive e-mail communications and enforces internal policies to preserve those rights. It is our objective to retain the long-term ability to continue to communicate with our users.</p>

<p>If you do not want AgendiZe or AgendiZe representatives to contact you, you may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're online or contacting AgendiZe directly. As part of your preference flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt back in and have AgendiZe contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For instructions, please see the section "Contact Us," below.</p>

<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still visit most AgendiZe websites; however, you will not have access to areas that require personal identification.
If a user elects to use our “Tell A Friend” application for forwarding a AgendiZe e-mail to their friend or informing a friend about our website, we ask them for the friend’s name and e-mail address. AgendiZe will automatically send the friend the specified e-mail or the specified website information. AgendiZe will not use the friend's information to contact them in the future.</p>

<h2>How AgendiZe will protect your personal information?</h2>

<p>AgendiZe will always protect the personal information that you share with us. AgendiZe stores information internally in a controlled, secure environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the transaction at hand and will not use the number for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

</p><p>If AgendiZe requests general demographic information, this information is limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for demographic reports with outside entities.</p>

<p>AgendiZe may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to provide personal information. If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that effect.</p>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.</p>

<h2>Contact us / How to update your personal information and preferences?</h2>

<p>You can help AgendiZe maintain the accuracy of your personal information by notifying us when you change your name, address, title, phone number, e-mail address, or your content preferences. If at any time you wish to update your information or preferences, or you prefer to stop receiving communication from AgendiZe, feel free to contact us at any time.</p>
