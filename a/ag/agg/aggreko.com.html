<h1>Privacy policy - Aggreko plc</h1>
<p>The following sets out the Data Protection and Privacy Policy
(the "Policy") for Aggreko plc ("Aggreko") and the manner in which
Aggreko collects, uses and stores personal data and information
submitted to it by its subscribers and/or users of its website
("you") or ("your").&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy is to be read in conjunction with Aggreko's legal
statement and in accessing and using Aggreko's website, you confirm
that you have read and understand this Policy and that you consent
to the collection and use of your personal information and details
by Aggreko in accordance with this Policy.&nbsp; If you wish at any
time to withdraw your consent, please notify the Data Protection
Manager of Aggreko at the email address set out in Section 9 of
this Policy.</p>
<p>1. PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>Aggreko is committed to protecting the privacy of those who use
its website, and the confidentiality of any personal information or
details submitted or provided to it by you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. DATA PROTECTION</p>
<p>Aggreko is fully registered in the UK under current data
protection legislation.&nbsp; As a company registered in England,
Aggreko is obliged to comply with European and UK data protection
legislation in all its dealings with your personal information and
data.</p>
<p>3. AGGREKO'S WEBSITE</p>
<p>Aggreko operates a global website.&nbsp; It can be found at
<a href="http://www.aggreko.com/"><strong>http://www.aggreko.com/</strong></a>
but can also be accessed in certain countries via national domain
name addresses.&nbsp; The Aggreko website is translated into
various languages for accessibility by users in certain
countries.&nbsp; Users should know, however, that Aggreko holds and
manages its website from the United States.&nbsp; This means that
information submitted to the Aggreko website will be transferred to
the United States as explained in paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>4. TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EEA</p>
<p>Aggreko is required to tell you if it transfers or intends to
transfer information which it holds about you to countries outside
the European Economic Area ("EEA").&nbsp; Aggreko currently
transfers information outside the EEA in the following
circumstances: (a) to its servers which are currently located in
the United States and which may in the future be located in another
country outside the EEA; and (b) to businesses in the Aggreko group
operating in countries outside the EEA for the purposes set out in
paragraph 3 below.&nbsp; Because Aggreko's servers are located in
the United States, the transfer of all of Aggreko's data outside
the EEA is necessary to enable Aggreko to operate its website and
to provide the products and information offered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By submitting your personal information and data to Aggreko, you
consent to the transfer and storage of your personal information
and data outside the EEA as set out herein.&nbsp; If you do not
wish any of your personal data or information to be stored or
transferred outside the EEA, you may withdraw your consent to such
at any time by notifying Aggreko's Data Protection Manager at the
email address set out in Section 9 of this Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Any personal information or details you provide to Aggreko on
this website, will be treated and kept in confidence and will not
be provided to anyone outside Aggreko's group of companies, but may
be used by Aggreko in the following ways:-</p>
<p>5.1. Where you have provided your contact details in order to
receive information from Aggreko, Aggreko or members of its group
may use your contact information to let you know about the products
or services it offers, (including online reports and newsletters)
and about enhancements or changes to its website or to enable
Aggreko to respond to complaints or to form management decisions
regarding the future development of its websites.&nbsp; If you
indicated your consent on the e-mail submission page, Aggreko may
also use your personal data for future e-mail mailings in relation
to the subject of interest that you identified on the email contact
page or the needs analysis page, in relation to support, and in
relation to new products or services that may be relevant to
you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2. Where you have provided personal information for the
purposes of employment with Aggreko, Aggreko or members of its
group may use the information submitted on the CV/resume page of
this website for the purposes of processing your application.&nbsp;
Aggreko may also use your personal data to notify you of job
openings within Aggreko which may be of interest to you.&nbsp; The
information you provide on the application form will be kept on
file by Aggreko in our CV management system for a period of six (6)
months from the date of submission.&nbsp; If after that period no
job has been matched to the information you provided, your personal
information will be inactivated on our database.&nbsp; If you are
contacted directly by Aggreko's Human Resources department after
the date of submission of your CV, Aggreko will be bound by the
relevant legislation regarding the retention of your CV on its
database during the period when it is considering hiring or
employing you and if you are employed, during your employment
period.</p>
<p>If you initially agree to Aggreko's use and storage of your
personal information in accordance with this Section 5, but later
wish to withdraw consent, you may unsubscribe at any time by
notifying Aggreko's Data Protection Manager at the email address
set out in Section 9 of this Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. SECURITY</p>
<p>Aggreko has put in place measures to ensure the security of
information it collects and stores about you, and will use its
reasonable endeavours to protect your personal data from
unauthorised disclosure and/or access including through the use of
network and database security measures, but it cannot guarantee the
security of any data it collects and stores.</p>
<p>7. HYPERLINKS</p>
<p>Where Aggreko's website provides links to other websites, it is
not responsible for the data protection policies of such other
websites, and you should check the privacy policies of such other
websites if you have any concerns about them.</p>
<p>8. RIGHT OF ACCESS</p>
<p>Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you have the right at any
time in writing to request access to any personal information or
details which Aggreko holds about you.&nbsp; Aggreko shall comply
with your request, in accordance with its obligations under the
Act, provided you have paid to Aggreko the necessary access fee and
Aggreko is satisfied as to your identity.&nbsp; If after accessing
such information you believe any of the personal data or
information that Aggreko holds about you is incorrect, please
provide Aggreko with your correct details and information by
contacting Aggreko's Data Protection Manager at the e-mail address
set out in Section 9 of this Policy.</p>
<p>9. LEGAL OBLIGATIONS</p>
<p>Aggreko may have obligations under certain legislation to check
the identity of users of its website and in such circumstances it
may need to make enquiries and obtain information from you for that
purpose.&nbsp; You confirm that all information you supply to
Aggreko will be accurate and you accept and agree that Aggreko may
pass on such information as it considers necessary to comply with
any legal/reporting obligations it has or may have from time to
time.</p>
<p>10. CHANGES TO THE POLICY</p>
<p>Aggreko may from time to time post changes to the Policy. In
such instances, Aggreko will post such changes on this page of its
website and Aggreko would invite you to review the Policy from time
to time in order to keep abreast of any changes to it.</p>
