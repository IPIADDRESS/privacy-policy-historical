<span class="diff_size">User Accounts:</span><br>

To provide you with an open, but also civil, discussion forum, we track user involvement in our community discussions.

<br><br>
</p>

	 <div class="policy_list">

            <li>We may share information about you to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Site's  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terms.html" target="_blank" class="mail_link">Terms and Conditions</a>, or as otherwise required by law. </li>

<span class="diff_size">Third-party services</span><br>

To customize your experience on the Site and to simplify the Site's registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to the Site through these third-party services, we may share information about you with these third-party service providers and they may share data about you with us. <br><br>

When you allow us to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site profile, we may use this data for several purposes, including: <br>
</p>

	<div class="policy_list">
    	<ul>
        	<li><i>Creating relationships automatically within our system. </i>For example, if you connect to us via a service with a public friend list, like Twitter, we may check to see if any people you follow on Twitter are also Site members. If we find a match, we will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans, followers, or friends on our Site. </li>
            <li><i>Suggesting relationships.</i> For example, if you connect via a service that has a private contact list (like Google and Yahoo!), we check for people in your contacts who are Site members and suggest that you become a fan of these users. This process is not automatic; you must affirmatively choose to become a fan of these suggested users. </li>
            <li><i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails.</i> When users share content with their friends using, for example, the forward-to-a-friend feature on the Site, we may use friend lists from third-party services to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send the email message. </li>
            <li><i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send service-specific messages.</i> For example, we may use friend lists from a third-party service to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send an invitation to view an interactive slideshow. </li>
            <li><i>To enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.</i> When you are connected via a third-party service, we may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about certain articles or blog posts, in order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
         <p class="conditions_txt">In addition, if you connect to a Facebook account, your experience on the Site may be personalized. For example, you may automatically see what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about particular stories.<br><br> 

Please note that you may disconnect third party accounts at any time. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/users/login/" target="_blank" class="mail_link">Click here</a> for a link to your social profile, where you may set your privacy preferences or disconnect all of your third-party service accounts.
