<h1>AGU - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>AGU respects the privacy of members, users of its services, and visitors to
its various Web sites and operates according to the following policies.</p>
<h1>E-mail Addresses</h1>
<p>Several AGU online services require the user to supply an e-mail address.
These addresses are used only for those services; they are not used to update
membership records unless so directed by the member. The e-mail addresses are
never shared with others. Subscribers to any AGU online service can stop the
service by following the instructions for that service or by sending an e-mail
message to service@agu.org.</p>
<h1>Other Personal Information</h1>
<p>Personal addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other demographic
information are collected for membership, subscriptions, meeting registrations,
submission of articles, and the like. </p>
<p>Contact information supplied when ordering publications, registering for
meetings, etc. is used for internal purposes only and is not shared with others
except as required to fulfill an order or service.</p>
<p>AGU’s online Membership Directory is a service restricted to members.
It contains basic contact information and membership data. AGU does not sell or
rent this information to anyone but does occasionally exchange postal addresses
with other scientific societies.</p>
<h1>Credit Cards</h1>
<p>AGU collects credit card numbers only to bill for specific services. These
numbers are not kept for future reference or use.</p>
<h1>Cookies</h1>
<p>A “cookie” is a file a Web site places in your computer for future
reference. AGU uses cookies to improve some of its services. For example, when
you return to that AGU service, the cookie will identify you as a previous
visitor. Information supplied through an AGU cookie is used only by AGU and not
shared with others.. </p>
<h1>Links to Other Sites</h1>
<p>AGU links to some other sites. AGU is not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of those sites.</p>
