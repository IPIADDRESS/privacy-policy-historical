<p>The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide periodically reviews its Privacy Policy and reserves 
the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time.
The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide considers the responsible use of personal information 
to be of vital importance. The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide is committed to ensuring that 
to the best of our ability we meet all the requirements of the National Privacy Principals and the 
Privacy Act.</p> 

<p>In general, you can visit the Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide website without revealing any 
personal information about yourself. 
However there are times when information will be collected, such as when you register for competitions 
or memberships, for billing purposes, appraisals or in connection with community postings such as 
message boards or feedback to us or to receive information from us. This information may include your 
name, home or business address and e-mail address. Personal information will only be collected when 
knowingly and voluntarily submitted.</p> 

<p>The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide may share the information obtained with other 
organisations with a similar purpose to our own. We will endeavour to limit the use of the information 
to the purpose for which it was provided.</p>
 
<p>The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide will seek your permission to send you further 
communications at the time you provide us with your personal information. If at any time after 
submitting your personal information to The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide you would 
no longer like to receive information from us, simply follow the ‘unsubscribe’ directions at the 
end of any e-mail communications you receive.</p> 

<p>No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event 
of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect server logs. 
The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way 
necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by 
The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide.</p>
 
<p>In general on The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide websites, IP addresses (a number that 
is unique to the computer through which you are connected to the internet) are logged to track a 
user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyse this data for certain trends and 
statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. 
In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. In 
those limited cases where session information is not anonymous, The Australian Good Food &amp; 
Accommodation Guide will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to 'opt out.'</p>

<p>When The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide receives information about your session 
or about you, we may also use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you.</p> 

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Some The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide web pages use "cookies".</p>

<p>Cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. You can set your 
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to 
accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may 
not be permitted to access certain information.). A server cannot find out a name or e-mail address, 
or anything about a user's computer, by using cookies. Cookie information is not stored or collected 
by The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide.</p> 

<p>Once The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide receives information from you via e-mail or 
any other means, the information is in a secure environment. Your personal information will not be 
released unless The Australian Good Food &amp; Accommodation Guide believes in good faith that the law 
requires it or your permission is granted.</p>
 
<h2>Security</h2>

privacy of personal information submitted to our sites, and periodically updates its security 
measures in light of current technologies. You need to be aware of inherent risks associated with

of obtaining and providing information. Normal mail, telephone and fax facilities are available.</p>
