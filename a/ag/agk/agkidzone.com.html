                    <h1>AGKidZone.com Privacy Policy</h1>

     The purpose of this policy is to inform you about the types of
     information we gather about you and your child when you visit our site,
     how we use that information, and your rights regarding our use of the
     information.<br>
     <br>
      
     AGKidZone.com and Parents.AGKidZone.com comply with the Children's
     Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We encourage you to participate
     in your child's online activities and monitor your child's use of this
     site. <br>
     <br>
      
     <b>1. What Is Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
      
      
     Personally identifiable information is information that can identify you
     or your child as an individual, such as your full name, your email
     address, or your postal address. Some information, like a first name or
     age, is personal in nature, but is not personally identifiable
     information because it cannot be used to identify or contact you or your
     child. <br>
     <br>

      
     <b>2. What Information Do You Collect and How Do You Collect It?</b><br>
      
     We will only collect the personally identifiable information that is
     necessary for you or your child to participate in an online activity. <br>
     <br>
      
     We do collect information in a variety of ways, although most of the
     information we collect is not personally identifiable information.
     <ol type="A">
      <li><b>Registration.</b> When your child registers on our site,
      we ask that your child create a username. Your child should not use
      any personally identifiable information as part of his or her
      username. We will also ask that your child tell us his or her age.
      Neither the username nor age is personally identifiable information,
      because it can't be used to contact you or your child or identify her
      offline. <br>
      <br>

      
      We will also ask for your email address, so that we may contact you to
      explain how we use the information we collect about your child and
      obtain your permission to do so. <br>
      <br>
      
      We will also collect your child's email address for various
      communications relating to the site. This is personally identifiable
      information and will not be disclosed except as described below. <br>
      <br>
      
      </li><li><b>Contests &amp; Sweepstakes. </b> From time to time we may conduct contests or sweepstakes. If your child participates in the contests or sweepstakes, under certain circumstances we may ask 
      you for personally identifiable information such as a postal address and full name if necessary to award prizes. 
      Personally identifiable information obtained specifically for contests and sweepstakes will not be shared with third parties.<br>
      <br>

      </li><li><b>Surveys and Feedback.</b> We may collect information in
      connection with surveys or online activities. We do not collect any
      personally identifiable information with surveys or feedback requests.
      Information you or your child provides in connection with feedback or
      surveys will not be connected with any personally identifiable
      information we have.<br>
      <br>
      
      </li><li><b>Website.</b> We use technology to collect information
      about the users on the site. For example, we use cookies, which are
      pieces of information that are placed on your computer for
      record-keeping purposes. As you move from page to page at our website,
      a cookie is the only way that we have of knowing who you are. An
      activity on one page may depend on what you selected on a previous
      page. We use a cookie to keep track of your selection. Without
      cookies, users may be asked to provide the same information
      repeatedly. Some activities may not function at all. <br>
      <br>
      
      You can control cookies from your end. Internet browsers (like
      Netscape, AOL and Explorer) give you the ability to control the use of
      cookies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you
      prefer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are in use.
      You may set your browser to disable or refuse cookies. You can also
      erase a cookie that has been placed on your computer by us or by
      others. If you do not allow cookies to be used in the traditional way,
      it is possible that some parts of the website will not function as we
      designed them. <br>
      <br>
      
      These techniques may transmit data directly to us, or to third parties
      we authorize to collect information on our behalf. None of the
      information collected through these methods is personally identifiable
      information, nor is it connected to any personally identifiable
      information about you or your child.<br>
      <br>
      
      </li><li><b>Email Communication From Us.</b> Our site may allow you or
      your child to sign up to receive newsletters, ecards, and emails from
      our site, containing special information or offers. In order to sign
      up for these activities, we will collect your child's first name and
      email address, and your email address if your child is under 13. If
      your child is under 13, we will contact you by email to notify you
      that your child has provided this information to us, to provide you
      with the opportunity to opt your child out of the collection of the
      information.<br>
      <br>
      
      </li><li><b>Safety and Security.</b> We may collect your personally
      identifiable information where necessary for your safety. We may also
      collect your personally identifiable information for the limited
      purposes of protecting the security and integrity of the website,
      taking precautions against liability, or responding to law
      enforcement.
     </li></ol>

     <b>3. Do You Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To Others?</b><br>
      
     We use all of the personally identifiable information we collect only to
     provide services related to the website. We do not share any personally
     identifiable information with third parties for marketing or advertising
     purposes. We may engage third parties to assist with services related to
     the website, such as technical and processing services, order or contest
     fulfillment, and analysis and website performance. These third parties
     are required to keep the information secure, can only use your
     information to provide services to us, and cannot use your information
     for marketing or advertising.<br>
     <br>
      
     If AG KidZone, or most or all of its assets, is transferred or sold to
     another entity, all information, including personally identifiable
     information would be transferred to that entity.<br>
     <br>
      
     We may also share personally identifiable information with third parties
     in order to comply with court orders, requests by law enforcement
     agencies, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect, the rights,
     safety, or property of our website and other users of the website.<br>
     <br>

      
     <b>4. Can Personally Identifiable Information Be Reviewed Or
     Corrected?</b><br>
      
     You can review the personally identifiable information provided by your
     child, request corrections to the information, ask that we delete the
     information from our database, or refuse further collection or use of
     the information by contacting help@agkidzone.com or by calling
     1-866-228-2429.<br>
     <br>
      
      
     <b> 5. How Do I Contact You About Your Privacy Policy?</b><br>
      
     To request further information about our privacy policy, you may email
     us at help@agkidzone.com, or send us a letter at: AG KidZone, American

     <br>

      
     <b> 6. Changes To The Privacy Policy</b><br>
      
     This website will change over time as we add exciting new features. The
     internet will also change as new capabilities and laws emerge. As a
     result, this privacy policy will be updated from time to time to reflect
     changes in our website. The date of the last revision of the privacy
     policy will be at the top of this policy. You should check the policy
     periodically to make sure you understand any changes to it.<br>
     <br>
      
     <b> 7. What Are The Privacy Policies Of The Links On Your Site?</b><br>
      
     Our website may contain links to other sites, including websites
     directed to children. We cannot control the privacy practices of these
     other sites, or their content. These other sites may use cookies and
     collect personally identifiable information. We urge to check the
     applicable privacy policy of the website sponsor when connecting to
     other websites.<br>
     <br>
      
     <b>8. California Residents&nbsp;&nbsp;. </b><br>

     who are visitors to the website to request information regarding our
