      <h1>AGKidZone.com Privacy Policy</h1>
      The purpose of this policy is to inform you about the types of
      information we gather about you and your child when you visit our site,
      how we use that information, and your rights regarding our use of the
      information.<br>
      <br>
      
      AGKidZone.com and Parents.AGKidZone.com comply with the Children's
      Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We encourage you to participate
      in your child's online activities and monitor your child's use of this
      site. <br>
      <br>
      
      <b>1. What Is Personally Identifiable Information?</b><br>
      
      
      Personally identifiable information is information that can identify you
      or your child as an individual, such as your full name, your email
      address, or your postal address. Some information, like a first name or
      age, is personal in nature, but is not personally identifiable
      information because it cannot be used to identify or contact you or your
      child. <br>
      <br>
      
      <b>2. What Information Do You Collect and How Do You Collect It?</b><br>
      
      We will only collect the personally identifiable information that is
      necessary for you or your child to participate in an online activity. <br>
      <br>
      
      We do collect information in a variety of ways, although most of the
      information we collect is not personally identifiable information.
      <ol type="A">
        <li><b>Registration.</b> When your child registers on our site,
        we ask that your child create a username. Your child should not use
        any personally identifiable information as part of his or her
        username. We will also ask that your child tell us his or her age.
        Neither the username nor age is personally identifiable information,
        because it can't be used to contact you or your child or identify her
        offline. <br>
        <br>
      
        We will also ask for your email address, so that we may contact you to
        explain how we use the information we collect about your child and
        obtain your permission to do so. <br>
        <br>
      
        We will also collect your child's email address for various
        communications relating to the site. This is personally identifiable
        information and will not be disclosed except as described below. <br>
        <br>
        </li><li><b>Contests. </b> From time to time we may conduct contests. If your child participates in the contests, under certain circumstances we may ask 
        you for personally identifiable information such as a postal address and full name if necessary to award prizes. 
        Personally identifiable information obtained specifically for contests will not be shared with third parties.<br>
        <br>
        </li><li><b>Surveys and Feedback.</b> We may collect information in
        connection with surveys or online activities. We do not collect any
        personally identifiable information with surveys or feedback requests.
        Information you or your child provides in connection with feedback or
        surveys will not be connected with any personally identifiable
        information we have.<br>
        <br>
        </li><li><b>Website.</b> We use technology to collect information
        about the users on the site. For example, we use cookies, which are
        pieces of information that are placed on your computer for
        record-keeping purposes. As you move from page to page at our website,
        a cookie is the only way that we have of knowing who you are. An
        activity on one page may depend on what you selected on a previous
        page. We use a cookie to keep track of your selection. Without
        cookies, users may be asked to provide the same information
        repeatedly. Some activities may not function at all. <br>
        <br>
      
        You can control cookies from your end. Internet browsers (like
        Netscape, AOL and Explorer) give you the ability to control the use of
        cookies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you
        prefer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are in use.
        You may set your browser to disable or refuse cookies. You can also
        erase a cookie that has been placed on your computer by us or by
        others. If you do not allow cookies to be used in the traditional way,
        it is possible that some parts of the website will not function as we
        designed them. <br>
        <br>
      
        These techniques may transmit data directly to us, or to third parties
        we authorize to collect information on our behalf. None of the
        information collected through these methods is personally identifiable
        information, nor is it connected to any personally identifiable
        information about you or your child.<br>
        <br>
        </li><li><b>Email Communication From Us.</b> Our site may allow you or
        your child to sign up to receive newsletters, ecards, and emails from
        our site, containing special information or offers. In order to sign
        up for these activities, we will collect your child's first name and
        email address, and your email address if your child is under 13. If
        your child is under 13, we will contact you by email to notify you
        that your child has provided this information to us, to provide you
        with the opportunity to opt your child out of the collection of the
        information.<br>
        <br>
        </li><li><b>Safety and Security.</b> We may collect your personally
        identifiable information where necessary for your safety. We may also
        collect your personally identifiable information for the limited
        purposes of protecting the security and integrity of the website,
        taking precautions against liability, or responding to law
        enforcement.
      </li></ol>
      <b>3. Do You Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To Others?</b><br>
      
      We use all of the personally identifiable information we collect only to
      provide services related to the website. We do not share any personally
      identifiable information with third parties for marketing or advertising
      purposes. We may engage third parties to assist with services related to
      the website, such as technical and processing services, order or contest
      fulfillment, and analysis and website performance. These third parties
      are required to keep the information secure, can only use your
      information to provide services to us, and cannot use your information
      for marketing or advertising.<br>
      <br>
      
      If AG KidZone, or most or all of its assets, is transferred or sold to
      another entity, all information, including personally identifiable
      information would be transferred to that entity.<br>
      <br>
      
      We may also share personally identifiable information with third parties
      in order to comply with court orders, requests by law enforcement
      agencies, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect, the rights,
      safety, or property of our website and other users of the website.<br>
      <br>
      
      <b>4. Can Personally Identifiable Information Be Reviewed Or
      Corrected?</b><br>
      
      You can review the personally identifiable information provided by your
      child, request corrections to the information, ask that we delete the
      information from our database, or refuse further collection or use of
      the information by contacting help@agkidzone.com or by calling
      1-866-228-2429.<br>
      <br>
      
      
      <b> 5. How Do I Contact You About Your Privacy Policy?</b><br>
      
      To request further information about our privacy policy, you may email
      us at help@agkidzone.com, or send us a letter at: AG KidZone, American
      Greetings Corporation, One American Road, Cleveland, Ohio, 44144.<br>
      <br>
      
      <b> 6. Changes To The Privacy Policy</b><br>
      
      This website will change over time as we add exciting new features. The
      internet will also change as new capabilities and laws emerge. As a
      result, this privacy policy will be updated from time to time to reflect
      changes in our website. The date of the last revision of the privacy
      policy will be at the top of this policy. You should check the policy
      periodically to make sure you understand any changes to it.<br>
      <br>
      
      <b> 7. What Are The Privacy Policies Of The Links On Your Site?</b><br>
      
      Our website may contain links to other sites, including websites
      directed to children. We cannot control the privacy practices of these
      other sites, or their content. These other sites may use cookies and
      collect personally identifiable information. We urge to check the
      applicable privacy policy of the website sponsor when connecting to
      other websites.<br>
      <br>
      
      <b>8. California Residents. </b><br>
      California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits residents of California
      who are visitors to the website to request information regarding our
      disclosure of their personal information to Third Parties for marketing
      purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:help@agkidzone.com">help@agkidzone.com</a>.<br>
      <br>
      
      <b> 9. Residents outside the U.S.</b><br>
      Personal information collected on the website may be stored and
      processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our
      affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities. By using the
      website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your
      country.
