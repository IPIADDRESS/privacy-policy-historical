          <p><strong>Privacy Policy<br>
			<br>
			</strong><span class="style13">As an Internet pioneer, 
			AgricultureInformation understands the power that the Internet holds 
			for changing people's lives, expanding their horizons, and enhancing 
			the ease with which they perform their jobs. All these benefits are 
			at risk if people are concerned about their personal privacy. 
			Agriculture Information is committed to providing its users with an 
			Internet experience that respects and protects their personal 
			privacy choices and concerns.<br>
			<br>
			Our privacy policy and practices are detailed below, and we ask you 
			to read them thoroughly. This policy is derived from three pledges 
			that we make to you, our users:<br>
			<br>
			We pledge that we will not release personally identifiable 
			information about you without your permission (except as needed to 
			provide to you the services you have expressly requested, as 
			explained in greater detail in the section on "third party 
			relationships" below).<br>
			<br>
			We pledge that we will provide the means for you to manage and 
			control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us.<br>
			<br>
			We pledge that we will provide mechanisms for you to communicate 
			your privacy questions and concerns to us and that we will respond 
			to them thoroughly and thoughtfully.<br>
			<br>
			We are constantly improving the tools you can use to manage the data 
			that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time 
			to see these new features.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Coverage</strong><br>
			<br>
			This policy applies to sites whose URL terminates in Agriculture 
			Information. Our affiliates have their own privacy policy 
			statements, which we encourage you to read whenever you visit these 
			sites. When we talk about "Agriculture Information" or "we" in this 
			policy, we are referring to Company and its majority-owned or 
			majority-controlled subsidiaries.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Helpful Definitions</strong><br>
			<br>
			Personally identifiable information is information—such as your 
			name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address—that can be used 
			to uniquely identify you.<br>
			<br>
			Anonymous Information is not personally identifiable information. 
			Anonymous information is information about how you use our site 
			(such as places visited and search queries performed). Anonymous 
			information also includes the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as 
			explained in greater detail below) of browsers that visit our site, 
			time of day the site was visited, and other non-personally 
			identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that 
			is not tied to any individual, but helps to characterize Agriculture 
			Information's users.<br>
			<br>
			The next sections tell how and when Agriculture Information collects 
			anonymous information and personally identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
			<br>
			<em>Registration</em><br>
			<br>
			We want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of 
			our services without telling us who you are or revealing any 
			personally identifiable information about yourself to us. It is only 
			during registration to become a registered user will you be asked to 
			provide us with personally identifiable information.<br>
			<br>
			Although the majority of our services do not require any form of 
			customer registration, we do require registration for the use of 
			certain services, the auctions and classifieds. During this 
			registration process we require you to complete certain fields, 
			offer optional fields for you to complete, and ask you to select a 
			user name and password. For example, we ask for contact information 
			(such as first and last name, email address, and zip code). 
			Agriculture Information uses this contact information in several 
			ways:<br>
			<br>
			to welcome you to the Agriculture Information Network<br>
			<br>
			to send communications from us about new features and services 
			available through Agriculture Information (unless you tell us not 
			to)<br>
			<br>
			to display advertisements on your screen that closely match your 
			interests (unless you tell us not to)<br>
			<br>
			to provide a first and last name on messages sent from your 
			Agriculture Information email account<br>
			<br>
			to share your information with select sponsors and partners who work 
			with Agriculture Information, only if you allow us to do so (as we 
			explain below)<br>
			<br>
			to allow our sponsors and partners to communicate with you, but only 
			if you tell us you want to receive these communications about their 
			services and offers<br>
			<br>
			If you indicate to us that you do not want to receive certain types 
			of communications at the time of registration, we will respect your 
			wishes, and comply with your preferences. If you already are a 
			registered user and would like to review or change the choices you 
			have made, you will be able to do so.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Contests, Etc.</em><br>
			<br>
			From time to time, we may run contests on our site in which we ask 
			participants for contact information, such as their email address(es). 
			If you participate in contests, your contact information will be 
			used primarily to reach you in connection with the contests. We may 
			also use the collected contact information to send you information 
			about Agriculture Information, our services, as well as offers 
			tailored to your interests by our advertisers and sponsors, if you 
			have opted to receive these communications. You may choose to 
			opt-out of receiving such mailings at the time of registration for 
			the contest, or afterwards.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</em><br>
			<br>
			To deliver advertising to you that most closely matches your 
			interests, we share your personal information with carefully 
			selected companies with whom we have relationships and trust. 
			However, we will not share your personally identifiable information 
			unless we have first given you notice that we might share your data, 
			and you have authorized us to do so. If you have not opted-in to 
			receive these offers, and would like to do so now, you will be able 
			to change your preferences. If you have previously opted-in, but now 
			wish to remove yourself from these mailing lists, you will be able 
			to change your preferences, or you may send email directly to us, 
			and we will modify your preferences accordingly. Our partners who 
			receive information from us have the right to use the data we 
			provide them (sometimes, in connection with other information they 
			may have gathered about you), but are generally prohibited from 
			sharing this information with other companies or people. In 
			addition, if we add new features or services that might require the 
			sharing of your personal information with an additional advertiser 
			or sponsor, we will provide you with notice and the opportunity to 
			opt-in to receive these offers.<br>
			<br>
			PLEASE NOTE: In certain special cases, we may disclose your 
			personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe 
			that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact 
			or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to 
			you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with Agriculture 
			Information's rights, property or operations, other Agriculture 
			Information users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such 
			activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable 
			information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to 
			any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a 
			criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in 
			connection with a pending civil case or administrative 
			investigation.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Anonymous Information</em><br>
			<br>
			When you use our site, we collect anonymous information, even if you 
			have not registered with Agriculture Information. We use this 
			information to personalize your experience at our site, show you 
			more relevant advertising messages, and generally to improve our 
			services. We share this anonymous information with selected 
			advertisers and partners, in order to deliver to you more relevant 
			advertising messages.<br>
			<br>
			Agriculture Information will not share any anonymous information 
			about your use on our site if that information is or will be linked 
			to your personally identifiable information unless we have given you 
			notice as described above and you have given us authorization to do 
			so. If you prefer that anonymous information not be shared with 
			other companies, then you may choose to opt-out during registration, 
			or by updating your preferences at any time.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Cookies: How They Are Used and Opting-Out</em><br>
			<br>
			How They Are Used<br>
			<br>
			A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser 
			from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies 
			do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way. We 
			use cookies to help us provide customizable services and to allow 
			you to sign-in to our site. For example, we can store your zip code 
			in a cookie and this enables us to display your local weather each 
			time you visit our site. Cookies also make web surfing easier for 
			you by saving your preferences while you're on our site. Cookies may 
			also be used by Agriculture Information partners on co-branded Web 
			pages, as explained below in "third party relationships," so please 
			be aware of this as you visit these Web pages.<br>
			<br>
			You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of 
			your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or 
			allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you 
			choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our site and 
			other Web sites may be diminished and some features will not work as 
			intended.<br>
			<br>
			Opting-out<br>
			<br>
			You can opt-out during the Agriculture Information Member 
			registration process or at any time from our site. You can also ask 
			to have all information related to your registration removed by 
			choosing this from our site.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Special Categories of Information</em><br>
			<br>
			Agriculture Information will not share any personally identifiable 
			information about our users that is of medical, financial or sexual 
			nature.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Use of IP Addresses</em><br>
			<br>
			An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers that is 
			automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your 
			internet service provider or through your company's local area 
			network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers - the powerful 
			computers that provide web pages for viewing - automatically 
			identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your 
			session online.<br>
			<br>
			Agriculture Information may collect I.P. addresses for purposes of 
			system administration, to report anonymous user information to our 
			advertisers (as explained above), and to audit the use of our site. 
			We do not ordinarily link a user's I.P. address to personally 
			identifiable information of that user, which means each user's 
			session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 
			However, we can and will use I.P. addresses to identify users of our 
			site when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our 
			site's terms of use or terms of service, or to protect our service, 
			site, or other users.<br>
			<br>
			PLEASE NOTE: Under certain circumstances, I.P. addresses and/or 
			domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, 
			when said information is stored in databases managed by Internet 
			registrars or registries.<br>
			<br>
			<em>Keywords</em><br>
			<br>
			Certain advertisers have paid for the right to display 
			advertisements on search results pages corresponding to certain 
			words. For instance, a particular resistor manufacturer may want its 
			advertisement to be displayed when users search for its resistor. We 
			want to be clear: by serving these ads, we are not affecting the 
			integrity of the search results in any way. The only difference is 
			that the ads that you see on the page may be influenced by the words 
			searched. Of course, many of the ads on the search results page may 
			also be randomly generated, so there is no clear-cut way of knowing 
			which ads are targeted to certain "key words" searched for, and 
			which are not. This is true whether or not you are a registered user 
			of our site.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Third-Party Relationships</strong><br>
			<br>
			In order to provide you with news and features that match your 
			interests, Agriculture Information has relationships with many of 
			the best media and services companies throughout the world. You can 
			recognize these sites by the joint branding of Agriculture 
			Information and such companies. For example, if you see a logo in 
			the upper-right corner of the page that says 'Powered by ______', 
			you will know you are on a co-branded Web page. If you ever have any 
			questions about whether certain information, content or services 
			pertain to us, or are "powered by" one of our partners, please 
			contact us at support@agricultureinformation.com.<br>
			<br>
			Whenever you provide registration information on certain co-branded 
			Web pages or for certain services provided in conjunction with third 
			party partners, we want to be clear that some data you provide is 
			shared with partners. You should make every effort to read the 
			privacy policies provided by or in association with such third 
			parties, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to 
			continue utilizing the services based upon the privacy policies 
			posted on these co-branded Web pages, at your own discretion. 
			However, we will make every effort to ensure that you have the 
			ability to opt-out of the sharing of such data with partners. You 
			may email us directly at support@agricultureinformation.com and we 
			will forward your request to the appropriate company, and help you 
			follow up to ensure that your concerns are adequately handled.<br>
			<br>
			In addition to finding co-branded Web pages, you will find direct 
			links on Agriculture Information to the sites offered by third 
			parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use the Agriculture 
			Information brand and/or logo. Agriculture Information carefully 
			evaluates all parties that are authorized to use its brand and/or 
			logo, and believes that all such sites have adopted acceptable 
			privacy policies. Again, you should read these third party privacy 
			policies, and make an informed decision on your own as to whether or 
			not to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices, at your 
			own discretion. No third-party sites are covered by this Privacy 
			Policy.<br>
			<br>
			VERY IMPORTANT: If you feel that a site using the Agriculture 
			Information brand and/or logo has not posted an acceptable privacy 
			policy, or is not following the privacy policy it has posted, please 
			send us an email at support@agricultureinformation.com. We will 
			forward complaints to the appropriate third parties and help you 
			follow up to ensure that your concerns are adequately handled. Of 
			course, if any of these third party companies does not have a 
			privacy policy that is acceptable to you, you should refrain from 
			providing information until your concerns have been satisfactorily 
			addressed.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Security</strong><br>
			<br>
			Agriculture Information operates secure data networks protected by 
			industry standard firewall and password protection. Agriculture 
			Information has security measures in place to attempt to protect 
			against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our 
			control.<br>
			<br>
			Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide 
			us. For example, we impose strict rules on Agriculture Information 
			employees who have access either to the databases that store user 
			information or to the servers that host our services. While we 
			cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not 
			occur, we make every effort (such as the use of employee passwords 
			and non-disclosure agreements) to prevent such unfortunate 
			occurrences.<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Contacting Us</strong><br>
			<br>
			If you have questions about this privacy policy or the practices of 
			this site, please contact:<br>

			Agriculture Information reserves the right to change this Privacy 
			Policy at any time. All changes will be posted to this page, and we 
			will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any 
			material changes to this privacy policy.</span><span class="genmed"><span class="style13"><br>
