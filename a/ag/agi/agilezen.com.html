			Rally Software Development Corp. ("Rally") has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate
			our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Rally web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because
			we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement as a means to
			communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement
			and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.
		</p><h3>Collected Information</h3><p>
			We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact information,
			such as their name and e-mail address, and billing information, such as their credit card number. Rally uses the
			information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information
			to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send
			information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive periodic
			communication via email by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will
			not be distributed or shared with any third parties other than Rally employees, consultants and representatives.
			Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by un-checking the
			<em>receive email announcements</em> checkbox on the Settings page.
		</p><p>
			Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">AgileZen Terms of Service</a>
			or this Privacy Statement, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing
			information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers
			and to bill for Services. This billing information is not used by Rally for marketing or promotional purposes.
			Rally uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in
			the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the
			sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on
			the Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Rally share any user information with
			these parties.
		</p><p>
			Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Rally will not review, share,
			distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">AgileZen Terms of Service</a>,
			or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving
			a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">AgileZen
			Terms of Service</a>, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the
			confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.
		</p><p>
			Rally may also collect certain information from visitors to and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses.
			This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly
			improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume
			statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.
		</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>
			When you interact with the Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site,
			our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive
			and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.
		</p><p>
			Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to
			identify yourself to Rally, you remain anonymous to Rally. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based.
			Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser
			software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or
			turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.
		</p><p>
			Rally uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while
			you are logged in. This information allows Rally to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies
			help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Rally
			application. Rally uses persistent cookies, that only Rally can read and use, to identify the fact that you are
			a Rally customer or prior Rally Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the
			security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account
			numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies
			will be able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use our service.
		</p><h3>Third-Party Sites</h3><p>
			The Site contains links to other web sites. Rally is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
			these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites
			to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private
			information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential.
		</p><h3>Security</h3><p>
			Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data
			under our control. If your AgileZen plan supports it, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is used to protect
			information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and
			available only to you. Critical information such as your password and credit card number are always encrypted
			using SSL, regardless of whether your plan lists SSL as a feature. Rally also implements an advanced security
			method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment
			that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.
			Finally, Rally provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on.
			These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
		</p><h3>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information</h3><p>
			You can update your contact information at any time by accessing the Settings page after you log in. From your
			dashboard, you can also update your billing information by clicking the <em>Change Billing</em> button on
			the account you would like to update. If you would like to discontinue service, you can do so by clicking the
			<em>Delete Account</em> button on the account you wish to cancel.
		</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><p>
			Questions regarding this Statement or the practices of this Site should be directed to Rally's Security Administrator
			by e-mailing such questions to <a href="mailto:security@rallydev.com">security@rallydev.com</a>.
