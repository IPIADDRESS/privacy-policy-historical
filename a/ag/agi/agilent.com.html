<h2>
	1. Notice</h2>
<h3>
	What information we collect</h3>
<p>
	During the course of your relationship with us, we collect personal information to enable you to order products or services, download software updates, make requests, register for customized communications programs and enhance your experience on our websites.</p>
<p>
	We may collect such personal information as your name, e-mail address, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information. While you are visiting our website, we may collect some technical data related to your browsing session such as IP address, browser type and language, number of times of you visited our website and the hyperlinks you visited.</p>
<p>
	In most cases, we use such technical data in aggregate form without identifying you personally for Agilent’s own reporting, statistics and website enhancements, as well as for information security purposes.</p>
<p>
	Through your in-person communications and/or on-line interactions with Agilent, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. In order to best serve you, we may correlate the information you provide to us through different communications and contact channels, such as data collected on-line may be combined with information provided off-line; for example, information provided via hard-copy form while attending an Agilent-sponsored seminar.</p>
<p>
	In addition, personal information will be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our site.</p>
<p>
	We are committed to keeping your personal data only as long as required to respond to your request, provide you with the product/service you are interested in, or for the time period necessary to fulfill our own legal obligations. Login or other tracking information that may identify you through website navigation will be stored for short time periods for technical security, website improvements, customer relationship purposes and so far as you continue interacting with Agilent.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>How we use the information</strong></h3>
<p>
	Agilent uses your personal information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your personal information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, provide updates on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites and communications with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Whenever we collect credit card numbers or other financial data, these are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	From time to time and with your permission, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. To unsubscribe from promotional emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Furthermore Agilent and its third party service providers may use cookies (as described below) to provide a more relevant and personal online experience.</p>
<p>
	For more information about how you can express your choice regarding the use of your personal information, please read below (“Choice”).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	2. Choice</h2>
<p>
	Agilent will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first notifying you and offering a choice.</p>
<p>
	We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt-out at any time of certain or all contacts from Agilent, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of our on-line or off-line communications to you as well as on our web registration pages.</p>
<p>
	You can choose to opt out from an offer or service you have previously accepted at any moment, at no cost and without any negative effect to your relationship with Agilent. To do so or if you have any difficulty exercising your choices or feel that choices you made on particular websites have not been taken into account, please use this <a href="/agilent/globaloptout.jspx">Unsubscribe form</a>.</p>
<p>
	Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your personal information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	3. Onward Transfer</h2>
<h3>
	Whom we share the information with</h3>
<p>
	Agilent does not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others except as described in this privacy statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We only share your personal information with other Agilent entities or distributors of Agilent products and services or service providers (e.g., a shipper, credit card processor, market research company, etc.) who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Agilent entities and business partners are required to keep this data confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Agilent.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
	– Agilent may also disclose your personal information (i) if we are required to do so by law; (ii) if we believe that it is necessary to protect and defend the rights of Agilent; (iii) in order to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry; or (iv) if Agilent is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Subject to your permission or as permitted by law, the personal information that you provide to us may be transferred across state or country borders to consolidate data storage, simplify information management or synchronize customer relationship activities globally.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	4. Access and Accuracy</h2>
<p>
	Agilent strives to keep your personal information accurate. We will provide you reasonable access to personal information you provided to Agilent and reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for deletion, as applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.</p>
<p>
	To access your personal information, return to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	If you cannot access your information on the web page, please telephone the nearest Agilent Call Center for assistance, or send your request to&nbsp; <a href="mailto:mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com">privacy_advocate@agilent.com</a></p>
<p>
	We will respond to your request for access within 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	5. Security</h2>
<p>
	Agilent is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and organizational measures to safeguard and secure it. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number) the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<h2>
	6. Tailoring E-Mail Communications and Web Experiences</h2>
<p>
	Agilent may employ technologies, such as web-tracking tools (described in section “7. How Agilent Uses Cookies”), designed for website session analysis and profiling of the users of our website. Such technologies enable us to optimize our website content and tailor it and other communications to you.</p>
<h2>
	7. How Agilent Uses Cookies</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Types of data collected through cookies and purposes of cookies’ use</strong></p>
<p>
	A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily (session cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user and serve up customized web pages and/or login information to the user's web browser when revisiting a web page.</p>
<p>
	We may use session and stored cookies (which may be provided by a third party operating on our behalf) to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. No personal information stored in Agilent cookies can be accessed by other websites.</p>
<p>
	The cookies help you avoid entering identification details each time you visit our website or repeatedly type the same information you are looking for on our website (search terms, key words, names of products, etc.). Cookies help us promptly display the information you need and other information which we consider may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookie and Clear gif usage and your choices about tracking technologies</strong></p>
<p>
	By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies we can provide a better web and marketing experience. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Provide an automated log-in process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an Agilent web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.</li>

	Website analysis operated through the cookies help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what is working and what is not. Agilent wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced in Agilent. While acknowledging the concerns that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile.</p>
<p>
	As a user you have the ability to accept or decline the use of cookies. Agilent tries to indicate data tracking through cookies and strives to find ways to display you relevant information and provide consent options when it dynamically interacts with you (e.g. on “sign-in” session or upon your registration on certain websites).</p>
<p>
	Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, to ask for permission to accept them, or to decline cookies completely.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p>
	We may also employ Clear Gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We also may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, clear gifs may be tied to personally- identifiable information.<br>
