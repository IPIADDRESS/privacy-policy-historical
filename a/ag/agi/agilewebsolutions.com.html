<h3>Our Commitment To Privacy</h3>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We collect information submitted by you for the purposes of purchasing Agile Web Solutions products, registering to use our support forums, signup for additional services, or to receive our newsletter or direct e-mail from us.</p>
<p>In most cases, we only only require your name and e-mail address. In the case of a purchase, we collect your address as well and we do not store any of your credit card or bank account information, but pass it directly to the payment service for the purpose of completing the transaction. We keep records of your purchase for the purpose of receipt and licensing information. Our web servers collect information that identify your IP address, browser information, operating system, and other non-personal information.</p>

<p>For those that opt-in, we e-mail a newsletter with information about Agile Web Solutions products and services. We do not share your name or e-mail address with other parties. When collecting address and payment information from you, it is only shared with other parties for the purposes of processing payments generated by you in our web store. We only retain the information necessary to track your transaction and retain payment information only for the purpose of supporting your order, such as resending lost license keys, issuing refunds, and filing tax returns.</p>
<p>Occasionally we may obtain special deals from other companies and notify or promote them to our current customers and newsletter subscribers. However, your information will never be sold; communications will be initiated by Agile Web Solutions and not outside parties.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
