However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.

</p><p><strong>Information Relating to Children</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at http://www.ftc.gov/. The AKVIS Website and any products or services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply. However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase products and services, or download software programs. The collection of information is covered above. Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so by contacting us by letter (using the address information provided at the bottom of this page). 
</p><p><strong>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</strong>
</p><p>AKVIS operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. AKVIS takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.
</p><p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our companyâs security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After personally identifiable information reaches AKVIS it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of AKVIS. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where AKVIS and its service providers conduct business. All AKVIS employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.
</p><p><strong>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong>
</p><p><strong>How your personal information is used</strong>

We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected.

Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, AKVIS will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.
</p><p>However, you should be aware that some of your contact information in advertisements and postings may be visible for all other visitors, and we cannot guarantee that someone will not use it for commercial or other purposes or activities.
</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong>
</p><p>Our Website uses âcookieâ technology. âCookiesâ are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a userâs computer. Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages together. Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with us. In addition, cookies are used to: 
</p><p>â¢	measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; 
</p><p>â¢	identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns; and 
</p><p>â¢	provide functionality such as online orders, AKVISâ services and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you. 
</p><p>The types of cookies that we use are referred to as âsessionâ cookies and âpersistentâ cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with AKVIS. Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.
</p><p>In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our e-mails, use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no cookies in the advertisement or e-mail. A cookie is placed on your computer only if and when you click on an advertisement or open the e-mail. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it.
</p><p>You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our Website.  
</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong>
</p><p>AKVIS may use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of AKVIS.  These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose AKVIS specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the AKVISâ affiliates for their use without your approval.
</p><p>AKVIS may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. AKVIS may also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating this Privacy Policy, the terms of your agreements with the Company or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.
</p><p>In the event that all or substantially all of AKVISâ stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, AKVIS may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.
</p><p><strong>Choices available to you </strong>
</p><p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the AKVIS Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to âopt-inâ and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such services. 
</p><p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AKVIS or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to âopt outâ we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.
</p><p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.
</p><p>AKVIS is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. 
</p><p>When you create a personal account with AKVIS and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal identification information, based on your personal preferences, we may periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.  These communications will relate to AKVIS offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom AKVIS has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you.  We may use a third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send AKVIS related e-mail.  If you do not wish to receive e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: unsubscribe@akvis.com.  In addition, every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.  You may also opt-out online by updating your personal account as described in <strong>Updating Your Personal References</strong> Section above. 
</p><p>To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide AKVIS with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to AKVIS when you requested services or products. AKVIS reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record. 
</p><p><strong>D. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</strong>
</p><p>AKVIS takes and addresses its usersâ privacy concerns with utmost respect and attention. If you believe that there was an instance of non-compliance with this Online Privacy Policy with regard to your personal information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write or contact AKVIS at email: <a href="mailto:privacy@akvis.com">privacy@akvis.com</a>.
</p><p>In your message, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the AKVIS Online Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly. 
</p><p>Please note that if you provide AKVIS with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), AKVIS cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.
</p><p>Please note that AKVIS does not collect any credit card information unless and until you provide such information in connection with your payment for AKVISâ paid services. AKVIS will never contact you to ask you for your credit card data or other personal information via e-mail, phone etc.
