<p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We may also allow certain business partners to place these technologies on the inMusic websites. These partners use these technologies to (1) help us analyze how you use the inMusic websites, such as by noting the third-party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise inMusic products and services to you on the inMusic websites and third-party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, or (4) collect information about your activities on the inMusic websites, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. For example, to help us better understand how people use the inMusic websites, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time. For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page</a>, or <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/">http://youronlinechoices.eu</a>. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings</a> page. To the extent advertising technology is integrated into the inMusic websites and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

As a result of this, you may send to the third party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of the inMusic websites. If you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity.

<h4><a name="_OUR_INTERNATIONAL_OPERATIONS">OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND DATA TRANSFERS</a></h4>
<p>We operate internationally and transfer information to the United States and other countries for the purposes described in this policy.</p>
<p>The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law.</p>
<p>To the extent that inMusic is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Model Clauses</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@inmusicbrands.com">privacy@inmusicbrands.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield</strong></p>
<p>inMusic does not participate in Privacy Shield at this time. However, inMusic Europe may rely on the EU-US Privacy Shield to transfer personal information to some of our third-party service providers in the United States, where they are certified to receive such information under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">Privacy Shield Program</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Necessary for the performance of the contract</strong></p>
<p>inMusic provides a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the services. However, if you want to use the services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between inMusic and its members. As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the services. Simply put, we cannot provide you with the services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.</p>
<h4><a name="_CHANGES_TO_THIS">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</a></h4>
<p>If and when inMusic makes changes to this site, inMusic may have to update this Privacy Policy to better reflect those changes. When we update it, we will change the “Last Update” date at the top of this page.&nbsp; Because changes to our sites or updates to this Privacy Policy may occur, you should review this Privacy Policy from time to time. Remember, your decision to continue using our sites after this Privacy Policy Statement is updated will signify that you have agreed to any new terms.</p>
