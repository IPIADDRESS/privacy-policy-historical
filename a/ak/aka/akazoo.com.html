<h2>
	YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHT
</h2>
<p>
	Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the
	right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all
	third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the
	preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that
	if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an "Opt-outâ€ or "Opt-inâ€
	choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers
	or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide
	you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
</p>
<p>
	Akazoo qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy
	and provides you with details on how you may either decline to permit ("Opt-out")
	or consent to ("Opt-in") the use of your Personal Information by third
	parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain
	or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information
	for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your
	third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address
	with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal
	mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at Akazoo.com or you may contact
	us via postal mail at:
</p>
<p>
	Akazoo â€“ Internetq Inc. 4720 Center BLVD, Suite PH5 11th Street, Long Island
	City, NY 11109<br>
	Attn: Your California Privacy Rights
</p>
<p>
	All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy
	Rightsâ€ on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request.
	For all requests, please include your name and home address. We will not accept
	requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that
	are not labeled or sent properly, notices that are illegible or do not have complete
	information.
</p>
<p>
	To all users of the Website, if you have any questions about this Privacy Statement,
	please contact our Privacy Administrator at Akazoo.com or:

	of the Terms of Use. Your continued use of our Service indicates your acceptance
	of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, maintenance, management
	and storage of your Personal Information as described. We may from time to time,
	transfer or merge your Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases
	or store off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal
	Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including
	information received from our advertisers and promotional partners. This Privacy
	Policy remains applicable to your Personal Information for as long as your Personal
	Information is in our possession, even if you terminate or discontinue your use
	of our Service and you acknowledge and agree you will be bound by its terms.
</p>
<p>
	Collection and Use of Personal Information: We collect Personal Information about
	you when you use our Service, as a user, Registered User and/or Subscriber, whether
	or not you register, enroll or sign up for particular activities, services, features
	or functions, participate in promotions, order or purchase goods or services or
	simply in the course of exchanges of information, transactions and activities (including,
	but not limited to, Posting) in connection with our Service. We may use your Personal
	Information to tailor your experience on our Services, serve advertising we think
	may be of relevance to you, to understand your preferences, and among other things,
	to provide you with offers we think may be of interest to you. It is your responsibility
	to give us current, complete, truthful, and accurate information and to keep the
	Personal Information that you provide us up to date. We cannot and shall not be
	responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate,
	truthful or complete information or you fail to update the information you give
	us. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your User
	ID. Bear in mind when you submit information to us, it does not guarantee that we
	will permit you to register, subscribe and/or participate in or use any or all of
	the activities, services, features or functions of our Service.
</p>
<p>
	Registered Users and Subscribers. Registered Users and Subscribers are required
	to submit certain Personal Information and maintain a User ID. If a Trial Period
	is available to you when you subscribe to any of our Subscription Services, we will
	allow you, subject to the terms and conditions (including any applicable time limitations)
	of such Trial Period, to use certain features and functions of our Subscription
	Services available to Subscribers and to take advantage of such a Trial Period you
	will be required to also provide us with Personal Information. At a minimum, when
	you sign up, enroll, register for or subscribe to any of our Services, we will require
	you to submit your mobile phone or wireless device number and in order to take advantage
	of our Subscription Services you must also give us your wireless or mobile carrier

	Terms of Use, (and, if applicable our Subscription Agreement) of which this Privacy
	Policy forms a part. Registered Users and Subscribers may be provided with opportunities
	to subscribe to text-message and/or email newsletters, alerts and other periodic
	communications and information we may send you. In some cases, when you as a user
	(even if you are not a Registered User or Subscriber), sign up for certain features
	or functions or submit your wireless or mobile device number to us or you elect
	to receive Content, send User Generated Content and/or Post, your actions in doing
	so may also include and be deemed to give us your consent for us to create a non-subscription
	account, send you and for you to receive such text-messages, email, e-newsletters
	and other communications from us. We will always disclose this to you if that is
	the case and you will be given the opportunity at that time and thereafter, to Opt-Out
	of receiving or continuing to receive these. You understand, acknowledge and agree
	that you are giving us your consent to track your use of the Service and all your
	activities, exchanges of information and transactions in connection with any Services
	you have agreed to receive or participate in as described. You are also confirming

	available on the Service (for example, sponsored contests or sweepstakes) and in
	addition to the Additional Terms that may apply, you may be required to submit Personal
	Information (e.g., your name, home address, email address, telephone number and
	date of birth) in order to participate. When you participate in any such promotion
	or offer, in addition to the Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy is a part,

	that apply. We may also make advertisements and promotional material and offers
	from third parties available on all or certain portions of our Website or in connection

	respond, take advantage of and/or accept any offer or redirect or have your browser
	redirected from our Website, or otherwise engage in any transactions or activities
	with such third parties, their privacy policies, terms and conditions and policies
	(and not ours) will govern their relationship with you, including, without limitation,
	the treatment of Personal Information and we shall have no liability, nor do we
	control or have any responsibility.
</p>
<p>
	Opt-Out Procedures. We may post notices, advertising and promotional material on
	our Website and/or we may contact you by email or text message or otherwise to promote
	our Services or to send you offers we believe may be of interest to you. You may
	chose to Opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional emails or text messages
	or similar electronic messages from us by sending us an email to <a href="mailto:support@akazoo.com?subject=Support">
		support@akazoo.com</a>. We may always contact you via email or SMS for administrative

	and for more information, please contact these third parties directly.
</p>
<p>
	Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities. We may provide our users with
	the opportunity to register for special promotions, alerts, services, music, video
	and other news, programming and information delivered via text messaging to your
	wireless or mobile device. If any of these are included in a sign up, registration
	or enrolment process, we will disclose that to you at the time you are requested
	to provide us with your Personal Information and we will advise you that continuing
	will constitute your consent to receive these from us. Users may be required to
	register or re-enter or provide additional Personal Information such as a wireless
	or mobile device number, email address and sometimes your wireless or mobile carrierâ€™s
	name to participate or take advantage of these Services. Optional information may
	be requested for specific offers, promotions or services and we may also collect
	an email address or other information. We caution that most wireless transmissions

</p>
<p>
	You understand and hereby acknowledge and agree you will be charged by your wireless

	has access to your User ID or your wireless or mobile device, device number or email
	address.</p>
<p>
	Use of Information. We will not use any Personal Information submitted to us in
	connection with our Service for any purpose but to provide the Services as you have
	requested, unless we provide advance notice to you of any other use. We will not
	share Personal Information we obtain solely in connection with our Service with

</p>
<p>
	Cookies and Similar Technology. We use "cookie" technology to collect
	data regarding your visits to our Website and your use of our Services. This data
	is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual.
	We use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Saving your User ID, wireless or mobile device number or other information so you
		donâ€™t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Website or use our Services;
	</li>
	<li>Keeping count of your return visits to our Website, advertisersâ€™ or partnersâ€™
		sites;</li>
	<li>Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with
		our Services and Content; and </li>
	<li>Determining which Services, Content, features and functions users like best.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update and
	enhance our Service, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. We use
	tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate, enhance, and improve
	our Services and display advertising and marketing information. You can choose to
	have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent or you
	can choose to turn off all such mechanisms. This is done through your browser. If
	you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features and functions of
	our Service that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and some of our
	Services may not function properly.
</p>
<p>
	Our Services may contain advertisements, references and links to other services,
	web sites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising
	and to communicate to you. Often these third parties employ cookie and web bug technologies
	to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules apply
	to the collection, storage, maintenance, use and disclosure of your information
	by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions, and other
	web sites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third
	parties is within their control and not ours and even if we have a relationship
	with a third party, we do not control their web sites, their technology or policies
	and practices regarding your information. This Privacy Policy does not cover any
	use of Personal Information that a third party, an advertiser or ad server may collect
	from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in
	this regard.
</p>
<p>
	Postings. We respect the privacy of the contents of certain non-public Postings
	you provide or make, however, even with respect to private Postings (including,
	without limitation, User Generated Content), we do reserve the right to monitor,
	edit and disclose your use of our Services and/or any information pertaining to
	a Posting and any of the contents to a third party if we believe such action is
	required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce our
	<a href="/site/documents/terms-of-use"><strong>Terms of Use </strong></a>or
	to protect our interests or the interests of our users, Registered Users, Subscribers,
	advertisers, suppliers, operational service providers or others.
</p>
<p>
	Disclosure to Third Parties. We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal
	Information to non-affiliated entities (i.e., entities that are not our parent or
	subsidiary or affiliated companies) or entities that are not our advertisers or
	operational service providers, except in the limited circumstances disclosed in
	this Privacy Policy. If we plan to disclose your Personal Information to any non-affiliated
	entities, we will ask you to Opt-in and allow it, in which case their use of your
	information is subject to their privacy policies. We may also offer co-branded services,
	features and functions, which are activities, events and promotions (for example,
	a contest) that we put together with another third party ("Co-Branded Partner").
	We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary
	use or participation in a co-branded promotion, activity, service, feature or function
	means you have given your affirmative consent to us and our Co-Branded Partner to
	collect, maintain, store and use your Personal Information. If you wish to Opt-out
	of a Co-Branded Partnerâ€™s future use of your Personal Information, you will need
	to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly.
</p>
<p>
	We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for
	the purpose of administering and maintaining our Services and our operations. These
	third party specialists that provide support to our Services, Website and Content
	are our "operational service providersâ€ and we use them to efficiently provide
	the full range of Content, subscription plans, services, promotions, advertising,
	downloading, streaming and other features and functions we offer or make available
	to you. We request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy
	and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not
	associated with our Services although we are not responsible for their failure to
	do so. Additionally, these operational service providers are not permitted to use
	your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.
</p>
<p>
	We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties
	in the following limited circumstances:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g.,
		to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); </li>
	<li>If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of
		the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, our Community
		Requirements or any Additional Terms or if you threaten the rights, property or
		safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Services, any
		of our operational service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users,
		registered users, Subscribers or any other party; </li>
	<li>If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate
		to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries to protect our business
		and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and regulatory
		obligations; or </li>
	<li>In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture
		or other business combination involving us. </li>
</ul>
<p>
	Security and Protection of Personal Information. We maintain reasonable standards
	of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites and wireless and
	mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or
	access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We
	conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure
	other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Services
	by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of
	such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and
	confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our
	operational service providers follow the same policy although we are not responsible
	for their failure to do so.
</p>
<p>
	Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information. Generally, you may review, update
	or delete any of your Personal Information collected by or through our Service,
	as well as your profile or any other user information you may have entered during
	the registration and/or subscription process or your participation in our Services
	or any prior updates you may have given us. You may also correct factual inaccuracies.
	However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date
	of birth or age or wireless or mobile device numbers, may be modified with sufficient
	verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete
	or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and
	all rights you may have to use our Services, your status as a Registered User, Subscriber
	and/or other aspects of our Service or offers we make available to you. If you have
	registered for or subscribed to any Services or provided any information as part
	of an account or profile in connection with our Service, you may review, update
	or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow
	the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with
	some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
	If you do not understand or are not sure what Personal Information may be collected
	or used for particular purposes, you should contact our Privacy Administrator via
	email with a request at support@akazoo.com and be prepared to provide verification
	of your identity.
</p>
<p>
	Personal Information collected for certain offers and promotions are subject to
	corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon
	the userâ€™s request. We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information
	by any person without the Registered Userâ€™s or Subscriberâ€™s User ID or, if applicable,
	appropriate identification.
</p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration,
	subscription, status as a Registered User, Subscriber, and/or the use of or access
	to any or all of our Services and any other services, content, activities, features
	or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person
	trying to use or access any portion of our Service, to use or access any information
	or to use a User ID. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal
	Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate
	rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such
	information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access
	cannot be provided and a contact for further inquiries.
</p>
