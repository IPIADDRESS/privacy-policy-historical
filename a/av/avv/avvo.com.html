	<p>Last Revised: June 1, 2007</p>

	<p>This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Web site owned and operated by Avvo, Inc. ("Avvo" "we" or "us")
	located at www.Avvo.com (the "Site").  The Policy is designed to tell you how we collect and use personal information
	(as defined below) so you can make an informed decision about using our Site.  Please read this statement before
	using our Site or submitting any personal information to us.  By using our Site, you represent that you are 13
	years old or older and you consent to the information collection and use practices described herein.  <strong>We
	reserve the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time by posting a revised privacy
	policy on the Site and indicating on the privacy policy the date it was last updated.  Your use of the Site
	following the posting of such changes or revised statement shall constitute your acceptance of any such changes.</strong>
	We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you visit our Site to determine if any changes have been
	made and to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p> 

	 
	<h2>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2> 

	<p>As used herein, the term "personal information" generally means information that specifically identifies
	an individual (such as user's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account
	number) or that is associated with an identifiable person (such as demographic information or information
	about a person's activities when such information is linked to personally identifying information).  However,
	personal information does <u>not</u> cover, any publicly available information and public records about lawyers,
	including without limitation information obtained from bar associations, courts, law enforcement agencies,
	and websites that are available to the public.  Personal information also does not include "aggregate" information,
	which is data we collect about the use of the Site or categories of Site users, from which any personal information
	has been removed.  For example, information that forty-seven percent of the Site's registered users identify
	themselves as male, is aggregate information.  We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including
	to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and
	services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires.  This policy in no
	way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information.</p>
 	
	
	<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

	<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site or use the various services
	 and activities available on our Site.  At several places on our Site, we may collect certain information you
	 voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information.  For example, if you register for the Site,
	 send us an email, contact or recommend a lawyer, or submit client ratings or peer endorsements, we may collect
	 your name, address, phone number, email address, and other personal, professional, demographic and business
	 information that you provide.    If you are a lawyer and claim or update your profile ("Profile"), we may also
	 collect your credit card information, photographs and professional and business information about you, your
	 practice areas and your educational background.  In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic,
	 contact or other personal or demographic information you provide in connection with your participation in
	 surveys, promotional offers, forums and other interactive areas of the Site.</p>

	<p>When you visit our Site, some information is also automatically collected through the use of log files,
	 such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type,
	 the address of a referring web site and your activity on the Site.  We use this information for purposes such
	 as analyzing trends, administering the Site, improving customer service, diagnosing problems with our servers,
	 tracking user movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may also automatically
	 collect certain information through the use of "cookies."  Cookies are small data files that are stored on a
	 user's hard drive at the request of a Web site to enable the site to recognize users who have previously visited
	 them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.  If we combine cookies with or link
	 them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat this information as personal information.
	  If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser instructions or help screen
	 to learn about these functions.  However, if your browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a
	 cookie, you will not be able to sign in to your Avvo account or lawyer Profile and will not be able to access
	 certain Site features or services.</p>

	<p>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site, provide certain functionalities (such as maps), or to
	 collect, track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from users, such
	 as the user's browser type, operating system, browsing behavior and demographic information.  These third parties
	 may collect personal information from you in connection with the services they provide and may place cookies, web
	 beacons or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal information  which may be used, among other
	 things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our
	 Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  We are not responsible for, and do not control, any
	 actions or policies of any third party service providers.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
	 Google Maps imagery is supplied by Google, Inc., and use thereof is subject to the Google Privacy Statement.</p>

	<h2>Usage and Disclosure</h2> 
	
	<p>In general, we use personal information we collect to facilitate your use of the Site, to provide you with
	 information, products and services you request, to administer and assist us with the operation of the Site and
	 of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.  For example, we may use the
	 information we collect: </p> 

	<p></p><ul>
		<li>to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Site, such as for administrative purposes or to provide you with customer service;</li>

		<li>if you are a lawyer, to verify your identity when attempting to claim your Profile;</li>
		
		<li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints;</li> 
		
		<li>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and our information and services; and</li>
	
		<li>for the specific purpose for which the information was provided. </li>
	
	</ul><p></p>
	
	<p>In addition, if you so indicate at the time of registration or on the my account page, we may use the information
	 we collect to send you legal news and product and service updates, including contacting you about our services,
	 products, activities , special events or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and
	 promotional purposes, including notifications about new features and or improvements to the Site or our products
	 and services; </p>
	
	<p>We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, and may combine
	 this information with the other personal information we have about you. In such cases, this Policy governs our 
	use and disclosure of such information.</p>

		
	<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h2> 
	
	<p>We do not sell, share, or rent any personal information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in
	 this Policy without first obtaining your consent, although we may provide aggregate information or other
	 nonpersonal information to third parties without your authorization.  We may share your contact information with
	 third parties if you have indicated to us that you wish to receive information from such parties.  In the event
	 that we engage or partner with third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the
	 operation of the Site and our business ("Service Providers"), we may share personal information with such Service
	 Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us.  For example, we may use credit card
	 processing or verification service companies to verify credit card information.  In addition, we may offer various
	 features through a third party service provider.  For example, mapping services are provided by Google Maps, and
	 our client rating service is operated by Bazaarvoice.  When you use these services, you are providing information
	 directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such party's own
	 privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage
	 you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with
	 which you come into contact.</p>
	
	<p>You should also note that personal information that you post to public areas of the Site, may become publicly
	 available.  For example, information you post  in your Profile or in  client ratings, peer endorsements,  forums,
	 blogs or any other interactive areas, or other information that is provided for the purpose of being shared may
	 be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone.  Your posting to such public areas of the Site
	 constitutes your consent to share such information publicly. </p>

	<p>We also may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with
	 the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other
	 policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our
	 customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our
	 Site; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person
	 requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information.  In addition, information
	 about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt
	 financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which
	 personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the
	 Company.</p>

	<p><u>Please note</u>:  The Site may contain links to other sites, including Avvo blogs or other interactive forums
	 hosted by a third party.  Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are
	 not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave our
	 Site and to read the privacy policies of any Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  Similarly,
	 if you entered this Site through another Web site, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that
	 site, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating site before providing any personal information
	 to that site.  This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by us.</p>


	<h2>WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?  </h2> 

	<p>Avvo endeavors to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure by putting into
	 place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect through this Site.
	  For example, when we collect credit card information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
	encryption software and store such credit card information  using encryption methods designed to prevent unauthorized
	 access.  Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.  Please
	 be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  To protect the
	 confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any
	 other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us
	 immediately by emailing us at customercare@avvo.com if you believe your password has been misused.  You should
	 also note that email is not secure, and you should not send any confidential or sensitive information to us via an
	 unsecured email.  </p>




	<h2>WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION? </h2> 
	
	<p>We will not use your personal information to send you legal news and product and service updates, unless you
	 "opt in" to receiving such emails  by so indicating at the time of registration or by changing your account
	 settings on the email and notifications page of the My Account section of the website.  In addition, you may
	 "opt out" of receiving marketing or promotional email from Avvo by following the unsubscribe instructions or using
	 the unsubscribe links within the emails we send.  Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account,
	 you may not "opt out" of receiving service or account-related emails from Avvo.</p>

	 
	<h2>HOW CAN YOU CORRECT AND UPDATE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2> 

	<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Policy or the practices relating to this Site, or you wish to
	 verify, correct or delete any personal information we have collected, please contact us at customercare@avvo.com,
	 and we will endeavor to respond to your inquiry or to correct, update or remove the personal information you have
	 provided us as you indicate to the extent possible.  You can correct certain information by logging into your
	 account and changing the information, and you may also delete certain information by closing your account.  In
	 addition, lawyers may change certain information contained in their Profile by claiming their Profile and editing
	 the information contained therein, by sending an email to customercare@avvo.com.  However, please note that in
	 certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information, even in the
	 event an account is closed.  For example, we may retain certain information, such as credit card information,
	 for a certain period of time, and we also may retain and continue to display any information you provided in
	 connection with a lawyer Profile or a blog or other interactive forum.  In lieu of email, you may also contact us
	 by mail at the following address:</p>
