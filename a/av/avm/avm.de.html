Definitions </h4>
<p class="bodytext">The definitions are in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter "General Data Protection Regulation" or "GDPR"). In particular, the definitions of Article 4 and Article 9 of the GDPR apply. For your information we have listed the essentially relevant definitions below under (X).
</p>
<h4>2. Scope of Personal Data Processing</h4>
<p class="bodytext">We collect and use the personalized data of our users in principle only insofar as this is necessary to render and provide our services and to prepare our web presence or online offers (including mobile apps).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Apart from this, personalized data are collected and used on a regular basis only
</p>
<p class="bodytext">(i) with the user's consent,<br>(ii) if the processing is required for the purpose of contract performance or <br>(iii) for the protection of legitimate interests, insofar as this is not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights of the persons affected that require the protection of personalized data. This also includes the transmission of data to authorities and/or courts.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Moreover, such cases are excepted in which it was not possible to obtain prior consent for practical reasons, or in which the processing of the data is permitted by statutory regulations.
</p>
<h4>3. Legal Bases</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Insofar as personalized data are processed on the basis of consent by the data subject, Article 6(1a) of the GDPR is the legal basis for such processing.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">For the processing of personalized data for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Article 6(1b) of the GDPR is the legal basis; this also applies for processing which is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If personalized data are processed in order to comply with legal obligations (such as, for example, retention periods stipulated by tax or commercial law, or information provided by authorities, etc.), Article 6(1c) of the GDPR is the legal basis.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">For the case that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person necessitate the processing of personalized data, Article 6(1d) of the GDPR is the legal basis.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Should processing take place in order to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party, and this interest is not overridden by the interests, fundamental rights and basic freedoms of the data subject, Article 6(1f) of the GDPR is the legal basis for processing.
</p>
<h4>4. Obtaining Consent / Right of Revocation</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Consent in accordance with Article 6(1a) of the GDPR is generally obtained electronically. The user consents by checking the checkbox in the corresponding field for the purpose of documenting that consent was granted. When consent is granted electronically, the "opt-in" method is used in the area for registered users (e.g. for Newsflash); for the purpose of identifying the user, "double opt-in" is used (e.g. to register for newsletters). The contents of the consent form are logged electronically.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Right of revocation: Please note that consent already granted can be revoked prospectively at any time – in full or in part; the legality of any processing that took place on the basis of consent up to the time consent was revoked remains unaffected. Please direct any revocation to the contact information for the responsible authority or the data protection officer listed under (II).
</p>
<h4>5. Possible Recipients of Personalized Data</h4>
<p class="bodytext">In order to provide our web and/or online services, we also employ third-party service providers ("processors") to act on our behalf and upon our instructions in the framework of service provision. In the framework of service provision, these service providers can receive personalized data or come into contact with personalized data, and constitute third parties or recipients in the terms of the GDPR.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">In such cases we ensure that our service providers offer sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject (cf. Article 28 of the GDPR).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Insofar as a transmission of personalized data to third parties and/or recipients outside of processing a job, we ensure that this occurs only in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR (e.g., Article 6(4) of the GDPR) and only where there is a corresponding legal basis (e.g., Article 6(4) of the GDPR).
</p>
<h4>6. Processing of Data in So-called "Third Countries"</h4>
<p class="bodytext">In general, the processing of your personalized data takes place within the EU, or within the European Economic Area ("EEA").
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Only in exceptional cases (e.g., in connection with the involvement of service providers to provide web analytic services) can it happen that information is transferred to so-called "third countries". "Third countries" are countries outside of the European Union and/or the Agreement on the European Economic Area, in which it cannot necessarily be assumed that the level of data protection is adequate according to the standards of the EU.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Insofar as the transmitted information also includes personalized data, we ensure before such a transfer that an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed in the given third country, or by the given recipient in the third country, or that you have provided your consent to such transfer, or there is another basis that permits such a transfer (e.g. Article 49 of the GDPR). An adequate data protection level can arise from what is called an "adequacy decision" by the European Commission or be guaranteed by application of the "EU standard contractual clauses". In the case of recipients in the US, compliance with the "EU-US Privacy Shield" can guarantee an adequate level of data protection. We are happy to provide you with further information on appropriate and suitable guarantees for adherence to an adequate level of data protection upon request; the contact information is provided at the beginning of this data protection documentation. Information on the participants in the EU-US Privacy Shield program is presented here: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank">www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>
</p>
<h4>7. Data Erasure and Storage Period</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Personalized data on the data subject are erased or locked as soon as the purpose of processing has expired. Data are stored after the purpose of processing has expired only when this is provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other directives to which our company is subject (e.g., to satisfy legal record-keeping requirements and/or when there are justified interests in storage (e.g. during the period of statutes of limitation for the purpose of legal defense against any claims). The data are also erased or locked when a storage period prescribed by the relevant standards expires, unless there is a necessity for the further storage of the data for the conclusion of a contract of for other purposes.
</p>
<h4>8. Rights of the Data Subjects</h4>
<p class="bodytext">The GDPR grants certain rights to data subjects effected by the processing of personalized data (known as "rights of the data subject", especially Articles 12 through 22 of the GDPR). The individual rights of the data subjects are clarified in (XI). If you would like to exercise one or more of these rights, you can contact us at any time. Please do so by using the contact information listed under (II).</p></div></div><!--TYPO3SEARCH_end--></div></div><div class="grid-element-accordion-header"><!--TYPO3SEARCH_begin--><div id="c129678" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n1"><h3 class="csc-firstHeader">IV.

Such a registration can further serve the purpose of providing certain contents and services for registered users as part of contract performance and/or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">The legal basis for processing data for the purpose of registration with the user's consent is Article 6(1a) of the GDPR. If registration serves the performance of a contract to which the user is party, or the implementation of pre-contractual measures, the legal basis for processing is Article 6(1b) of the GDPR. Insofar as registration serves the purpose of access restriction and/or control, the protection of legitimate interest is the legal basis as stipulated in Article 6(1f) of the GDPR; in this case the legitimate interest is in the restriction of access to protect the contents and information we developed.
</p>
<h4>2. Data Erasure and Storage Period</h4>
<p class="bodytext">Should registration take place in connection with performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures (Article 6(1b) of the GDPR), the registration data are stored for the duration of the given working or contractual relationship, and then erased or locked after expiration of the given contract, or after the period of notice as stipulated in (III.7).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">If registration does not take place in connection with performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures, the registration data are erased as stipulated in (III.7) as soon as a registration with our website is withdrawn, modified or deleted by the user.
</p>

The legal basis for the use of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing by post is Art. 6 (1f) of the GDPR (legitimate interest); the legitimate interest here consists in addressing potential customers for the purpose of direct advertising for our products and services. For advertising and/or marketing measures via email for the purpose of direct advertising for similar wares or services of our own, the legal basis is Section 7(3) of the German Fair Trade Practices Act (UWG); this is subject to the condition that (i) we received your email address in connection with the sale of a good or service, (ii) you did not refuse to allow your email address to be used for the purpose of direct advertising and (iii) upon the collection of your email address and every time we use it, we clearly point out that you may refuse at any time to have your email address used in this way (on the right to refuse, see [XI.6]).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Your personal data will be stored and used for advertising purposes indefinitely, depending on the respective legal basis for the advertising measure (consent or legitimate interest), until you object to the use of your data for advertising purposes or until you revoke your corresponding consent. You can revoke consent to a processing of personal data at any time, with effect for the future. You may object to processing on the basis of legitimate interests at any time; a right of objection exists in particular in the case of profiling in accordance with Art. 21 of the GDPR. In the event of revocation and/or objection, the personal data will no longer be processed for the purposes concerned; with the exception of processing of data which is still required for the purpose of fulfilling the contract (Art. 6 (1b) of the GDPR) including statutory storage obligations and/or if the data is still required within the framework of legitimate interests (Art. 6 (1b) GDPR) (e.g. in the event of an advertising objection, processing of data in a so-called blacklist in order to prevent future advertising approaches).

<h4>6. Messaging apps</h4>
<p class="bodytext">As a subscriber to our instant messaging services, for example WhatsApp News, you will receive the latest updates and news directly to your smartphone or tablet. To register, AVM generally needs a phone number or similar. In order to check whether you are the owner of the phone number provided, or that the owner of the phone number consents to receiving the news updates, after the first registration step we will send an automated text message to the phone number provided (the so-called "double opt-in"). Save the sender of the message as a new contact in your smartphone or tablet.  Only after you've sent a message to this contact e.g. "START" can we start sending you the latest updates and news. We do not collect any personal data other than the phone number and the information that the registration has been confirmed. Your data are processed exclusively for the purpose of providing with information about the latest news from AVM, as requested by you. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1b) of the GDPR. You can unsubscribe from the news service at any time; in addition, the remarks on the right of revocation in (III.4) apply.</p></div></div><!--TYPO3SEARCH_end--></div></div><div class="grid-element-accordion-header"><!--TYPO3SEARCH_begin--><div id="c129696" class="csc-default"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n1"><h3 class="csc-firstHeader">IX.

The communication is ended, or there is a conclusive response, when the circumstances indicate that the matter in question has been settled. Instead of erasure, data will be stored and locked if further storage of the data is required for the reasons listed in (III.5).

<p class="bodytext">The additional personalized data collected during the process of transmission are erased after a period no longer than seven days.
</p>
<h4>3. Opt-out and Elimination Options</h4>
<p class="bodytext">The user has the possibility to terminate communication with us and/or rescind his request at any time, and to object to the corresponding use of his data.
