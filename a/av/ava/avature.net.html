    <h3>Personal information</h3>
      <p>In general, you can visit Avature on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you.<br>
      You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Avature that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. </p>
    <h3>Marketing Use of Personal Information</h3>
      <p>The information you provide to Avature on Avature Web sites may also be used by Avature for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. </p>
    <h3>Avature Career Sites</h3>
      <p>In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an Avature Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout Avature and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration and we may share this information with our client companies.  We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume/CV from the Avature Web Site, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to the Avature resume database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles in these instances.</p>
    <h3>Posting to Public Areas of Avature Web Site</h3>
      <p>Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas of the Avature Web Site, such as in online forums or chat rooms, or in the Avature searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Avature Web Site. In addition, each participant's opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of Avature. </p>  
    <h3>Our Worldwide Practices</h3>
      <p>Avature is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders.<br>
    Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for your personal information, all over the world.<br>
    We may share your personal information within Avature and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business.<br>
    Some countries may provide less legal protection for your information. In such countries Avature will still handle information in the manner described here.</p>
    <h3>Information Security and Quality</h3>
      <p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality.</p>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." Avature may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better service.<br>
    We collect non-identifiable information through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some Avature pages use cookies, sent by Avature, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly.</p>
    <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
      <p>Avature Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.<br>
    You may not decline web beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
    <h3>Personalized URL Link</h3>
      <p>On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services or career opportunities that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions with Avature and information you have provided to us. While you are visiting these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web site.<br>
    If you choose to visit one of these Web sites, you are agreeing to let Avature collect information about your visits and also to its association with other information about you and your relationship with Avature. If you do not wish your information to be used in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.</p>
    <h3>Disclosures Required By Law</h3>
      <p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.</p>
