                    This policy applies to personal data collected by Avature from its customers, providers, partners, business associates, advisors, prospects and their respective employees, representatives and agents, from applicants for employment and from members of the general public.<br>
                    If you are an Avature employee, you should also consult Avature’s Privacy Policy regarding Employee’s Data.<br>
                    If your information is being processed by Avature on behalf of one of Avature’s customers, such customer’s privacy policy applies to the processing.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Avature provides software application services, which include data processing activities, and hosting activities. Avature’s customers primarily use our hosted services for Recruiting, Recruitment Marketing and Communication, and Talent Management activities. Avature’s customers upload their data (including Personal Data of prospective job candidates and employees) to the Avature hosted environment. Depending on our agreement with the respective customer, this data may be stored in the United States of America, the Netherlands, Argentina, Germany, Russia and Singapore, and it may be transferred by Avature to other countries where we have operations. Once the data is stored, our customers access our solution and their data for staffing purposes. Individuals involved in these recruitment and staffing activities interact directly with Avature’s customers, rather than with Avature. Avature is a “data processor” for our customers, who operate as “controllers” of Personal Data.<br>
                    Avature does not collect Personal Data for resale, sell Personal Data it has collected, or sell access to Personal Data.

                    In general, you can visit Avature on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may request information from you.<br>
                    You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail address, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us or a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Avature that you wish to be considered for. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.<br>

                    Purpose and Practices
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In general, Avature may retain Personal Data about several different types of individuals, including (i) website visitors, (ii) customers, suppliers, providers, partners, business associates, advisors, prospects and their employees, representatives and agents, (iii) candidates for employment with us or our customers, and (iv) Avature’s own employees. Avature’s practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Website visitors</strong><br><br>
                    In general, we do not store personal information about website visitors. However, we might use cookies to improve your and other’s experience. Please refer to the cookies section of this policy.<br>
                    If you choose to provide some personal information in our website, we will use that information for the purpose for which you provided it and in accordance with this policy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Customers, Suppliers, Providers, Partners, Business Associates, Advisors, Prospects AND their Employees, Representatives and Agents</strong><br><br>
                    Avature may obtain Personal Data about employees, representatives and agents of our customers, suppliers, providers, partners, business associates, advisors and prospects. Such data may include contact information (names, titles, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses); information about products and services ordered or provided; financial and payment information; user ID, passwords, and information collected through Internet-based activities.<br>
                    Avature may use these types of Personal Data for business purposes, including delivering products or services; establishing or maintaining client and business relationships; providing access to Internet-based activities; performing accounting functions; and conducting other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.<br>
                    Employees, representatives and agents of our customers, suppliers, providers, partners, business associates, advisors and prospects may contact us if any of their Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and correct Personal Data that we maintain about them. In any event, such persons can also contact us by sending an email to Avature’s Privacy Officer (<a href="mailto:privacyofficer@avature.net">privacyofficer@avature.net</a>), or by using the information at the end of this privacy statement.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Candidates for Employment with Us</strong><br><br>
                    Avature may obtain Personal Data about candidates for employment. Our goal in collecting your personal data is to evaluate your qualifications to work directly for us. We ask candidates for their names, addresses, and other Personal Data such as work experience, education, and skills, contact details, work preferences, and other information. When hiring employees, we may also request Personal Data that is considered "sensitive," such as information necessary to provide health benefits. Avature recommends that you do not disclose sensitive personal characteristics (e.g., gender.) on the initial resume or curriculum vitae (CV) you submit to us. The amount of Personal Data you are required to supply will normally be limited to information needed to evaluate your ability to perform the job for which we are considering you.<br>
                    Avature may use this type of data to facilitate the selection, hiring, and internal mobility of individual candidates for specific employment.<br>
                    If you would like to correct, amend, or delete your personal data, you should contact us directly with any such requests.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>End Users of Avature’s Hosted Application Service (including candidates for employments with our customers)</strong><br><br>
                    In cases where we are acting as a data processor on behalf of our customers, such as when we act as an application service provider that delivers Human Resources software, we conduct such activities strictly in accordance with our customer’s instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. It remains the responsibility of our customers to inform the individuals of the purposes for which they collect and use Personal Data, about the choices and means, and any ways that the individuals may limit the use or disclosure of their information. In this instance, the software would be clearly identified as belonging to our customer and would be branded with their logos and company information. If you are a candidate with one of our customers through this software, or an End User of this software with an existing relationship with one of our customers, you should refer to the customer’s website or their human resources manager to understand the privacy practices that apply to Personal Data that we may maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to correct, amend or delete your Personal Data, you should contact our customer (your potential or existing employer) with any such requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our customers to assist with such responses.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Avature’s employees</strong><br><br>
                    Avature’s HR privacy policy is available on the Wiki, you may consult it any time you want to see what data we hold about our employees and how and for what purpose we use it.
