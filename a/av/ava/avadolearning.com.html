            objective. Very occasionally, we may also invite you to participate in a customer survey to improve our
            service to you.</p><h3>Website customisation and targeting of adverts</h3><p>We use the data you give us about yourself to build up a picture of your interests - we then try to
            ensure that when you visit the site, you don’t miss the offers and information relevant to you.</p><p>We and our reputable third party companies will collect website usage information about visitors to our

                patterns across AVADO website. You may wish to print this page.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is in a cookie?</h3><p>A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s
                server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie
                is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier
                and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your
                preferences or whether you are logged into a site to protect your privacy.</p><h3>What to do if you do not want cookies to be set:</h3><p>Some people find the idea of a website storing any information on their computer or mobile device
                intrusive, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without their
                knowledge. Although AVADO cookies are quite harmless, you may not, for example, want to see
                advertising that has been targeted to your interests. If you prefer, it is possible to block some
                cookies, all cookies, or even cookies that have already been set; but you need to be aware that you
                might lose some functions of the website.</p><h3>Web browser cookies</h3><p>If you do not want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when
                cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have
                already been set.</p><p>If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do
                this through your browser settings; the Help function within your browser should tell you how.
                Alternatively, you may wish to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a>, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide
                variety of desktop browsers.</p><p>The AVADO website does work without cookies, but you will lose some features and functionality if
                you choose to disable cookies. For example, you won’t be able to see the homepage banner, which
                often showcases customer promotions and discounts.</p><h3>Adobe Flash Player Cookies</h3><p>The Adobe Flash Player, used to provide services such as MyWeb Presenters, is also capable of
                storing information on your device. However, these cookies cannot be controlled through your web
                browser. Some web browser manufacturers are developing solutions to allow you to control these through
                your browser, but at the present time, if you wish to restrict or block Flash Cookies, then you must do
                this on the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">Adobe website</a>.</p><p>Please be aware that restricting the use of Flash Cookies may affect the features available to
                you.</p><h3>Strictly necessary cookies</h3><p>Some cookies are strictly necessary in order to enable you to move around the website and use its
                features. Without these cookies, we will not be able to determine the number of unique users of the
                site or provide certain features.</p><hr><h3><br></h3><table class="table table-striped k-table"><thead><tr><th style="width:30%;">Cookie name</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Persist-Session</td><td>This cookie allows us to choose a web server with the most resources to provide you
