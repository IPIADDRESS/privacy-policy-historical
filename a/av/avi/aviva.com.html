		<p><strong>What “we” means</strong></p>
		<p>This privacy policy is issued on behalf of the Aviva Group companies within the United Kingdom. When we mention "Aviva", "we", "us" or "our", what we mean is the relevant company in the Aviva Group that <strong>processes</strong> your <strong>personal information</strong>.</p>
	
		<p><strong>We have separate privacy notices for our products</strong></p>
		<p>If you’re one of our customers, we will give you separate privacy notices when we ask for your <strong>personal information</strong>, for example, when you get a quote or apply for our products. Read them carefully, as they’ll tell you which Aviva company is responsible for managing your <strong>personal information</strong> and provide more details about how we’ll use it in relation to that product.</p>
		<p>You’ll find more privacy notices when you use our apps and platforms such as Drive or MyAviva. This Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.</p>
		<p>We’ll keep this Policy up to date with the latest legal requirements, so please check back here for the current version.</p>

		<p><strong>Sensitive information</strong></p>
		<p>Sometimes we’ll ask about your <strong>health</strong>, details of <strong>offences and convictions</strong> or other sensitive information about the person(s) who is/are being insured and their family members. We know how sensitive that data is, so protecting it is a top priority.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Payment information</strong></p>
		<p>If you buy a product directly from our website or other Aviva sales channel, we’ll ask for <strong>payment information</strong>. We need this to complete your purchase.</p>

		<p><strong>Information about other individuals</strong></p>
		<p>Most of the information we collect relates to the person taking out a product (or persons where it’s taken out jointly). We may also ask for information about other individuals if we need it. Examples include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>if you ask us to provide insurance for other household or family members, or members of a group</li>
			<li>if we ask an <strong>insured person</strong> to provide <strong>health information</strong> about other family members where this is relevant to the risk we’re covering when we <strong>arrange</strong> a policy</li>
			<li>if we need information about other individuals when we handle a <strong>claim</strong>, such as injured third parties</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you provide us with information about someone else, we’ll assume that you have their permission. We’ll <strong>process</strong> their <strong>personal information</strong> according to this Privacy Policy so please encourage them to read it if they want to find out more.</p>

		<p><strong>Brokers, intermediaries, employers and third parties</strong></p>
		<p>Many customers buy our products through an insurance <strong>broker</strong>, financial adviser or one of our <strong>business partners</strong>. We also receive <strong>personal information</strong> from other third parties, including attorneys, trustees and family members. It is their responsibility to make sure they explain to the person whose information is being shared that they are doing so, and ask for permission if needed.</p>

		<p><strong>Who we share personal information with</strong></p>
		<p>Depending on the product or service, we’ll share <strong>personal information</strong> with a number of our trusted third parties, including:</p>
		<ul>

		</ul>

		<p><strong>Extraordinary circumstances</strong></p>

		<h5 id="motorInsurance"><strong>1.1 Motor and home insurance</strong></h5>
		<p>When you take out a motor or home policy, we’ll collect and use your <strong>personal information</strong> to <strong>arrange</strong>, <strong>underwrite</strong> and <strong>manage</strong> your policy, as well as prevent fraud and <strong>handle claims</strong>.</p>
		<p>The <strong>personal information</strong> we use for these types of policies includes any relevant <strong>offences and convictions</strong> for each person to be insured under the policy as well as any relevant <strong>health information</strong>, for example if a <strong>claim</strong> is made involving a personal injury.</p>
		<p>If you take out a motor policy we’ll also collect and use information about you and your vehicle. We’ll get this information from you, public registers, our trusted third parties such as the <strong>MIB</strong> and from information already held by us, eg from previous policies or quotes. If you’re seeking a policy with telematics capability, we’ll also use <strong>telematics data</strong>.</p>

		<h6>Your driving history</h6>
		<p>We may ask you to provide the driving licence number so we can quickly get useful data from the DVLA such as the licence status of each driver, their licence entitlement, relevant restriction information, endorsement and conviction details. If you do not wish to provide us with your licence information, you can choose to answer the questions about your licence information yourself.</p>
		<p>We’ll also add details of the policy to the Motor Insurance Database maintained by the <strong>MIB</strong>. The <strong>MIB</strong> may make this information available to authorised bodies such as the <strong>DVLA, DVLNI</strong> and <strong>IFB</strong>.</p>

		<h6>About your home</h6>
		<p>When you take out a home policy, we may obtain information about you and your home from publicly available registers and databases. These may include land registers, as well as information already held by us, such as information about previous policies or <strong>claims</strong>, or from our trusted third parties, such as commercially available property databases where this will help us <strong>underwrite</strong> the policy.</p>
		<p>In some cases when you apply for motor or home insurance, we may share your information with credit reference agencies so they can carry out searches relating to you. Find out more about how we work with credit reference agencies <a href="#creditReference">here</a>.</p>

		<h6>Automated decision making</h6>
		<p>We need your <strong>personal information</strong> when you apply for a policy to decide if we can offer a policy and, if so, on what terms. We use an automated underwriting engine as part of that <strong>process</strong>, which takes account of the information you have provided including address, post code, and age, (and, for motor policies, we use marital status, employment details and details of health and relevant <strong>offences and convictions</strong> for you and any other drivers). The automated engine may also validate information you provide against other records we hold about you in our systems and third party databases, including public databases. We may supplement the information you provide with information from third parties who can provide more information about your vehicle or property (including <strong>DVLA</strong> databases, land registries and commercially available property databases). More details on your rights in relation to <strong>automated decision making</strong> are <a href="#yourRights">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Throughout the term of these types of policies we’ll hold your <strong>personal information</strong> to enable us to properly administer the policy, such as offering renewal or dealing with <strong>claims</strong>. We may use the information to perform analytics and ensure we’re appropriately pricing our products.</p>

		<h6>Verifying claims</h6>
		<p>If a <strong>claim</strong> is made, we use your <strong>personal information</strong> to verify the <strong>claim</strong> and ensure that we pay out to the right person. In addition we’ll need to collect and use the following <strong>personal information</strong>:</p>

			<li>for a <strong>claim</strong> following a motor accident, we’ll ask for details of the <strong>claim</strong>, information about those involved and any personal injury you or others may have suffered</li>

		<p>For health policies we may also ask you to authorise your healthcare provider to supply relevant supporting information, including, where relevant, <strong>health information</strong> about the family or personal history of each person to be insured. </p>

		<h6>Automated decision making</h6>
		<p>We need your <strong>personal information</strong> when you apply to us to decide if we can offer a policy and, if so, on what terms. We use an automated underwriting engine as part of that <strong>process</strong>, which takes account of the information you have provided (including address, age and any medical conditions of the policyholder and any other people to be insured).

		<ul>
			<li>For pet insurance claims we’ll also collect information about any illness or injury in relation to the pet and we may also seek information from the treating vet.

We may also need to ask you to authorise your healthcare provider to provide information to assist in assessing the <strong>claim</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<h5 id="lifeInsurance"><strong>1.4 Life insurance</strong></h5>

		<h6>Automated decision making</h6>

We’ll make clear to you in the application for each policy whether automated underwriting is used.

		<p>Wherever we collect or use this information, we’ll make sure we do this for a valid legal reason. This will be for at least one of the following purposes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to <strong>arrange</strong>, <strong>underwrite</strong> or <strong>manage</strong> our products, or <strong>handle claims</strong> in accordance with their terms</li>
			<li>to meet responsibilities we have to our regulators, tax officials, law enforcement, or otherwise meet our legal responsibilities</li>

		</ul>
		<p>We can only collect and use <strong>sensitive personal information</strong> in limited circumstances, where we’ve obtained your explicit consent, where we need this information to <strong>arrange</strong>, <strong>underwrite</strong> or <strong>manage</strong> our products or to <strong>handle claims</strong>, or where we have another legal basis for doing so as explained in this privacy policy.</p>
		<p>You can find more information about when and why we use <strong>personal information</strong> in other parts of this privacy policy, as well as the notices we provide when we collect information from you. If you would like to know more about the legal reasons or <strong>legitimate interests</strong> that apply to a particular way in which we use <strong>personal information</strong> you can <a href="#contactUs">contact us</a> at any time.</p>

		<h5 id="marketingPreferences"><strong>2.2 Marketing and marketing preferences</strong></h5>
		<p>We may use <strong>personal information</strong> to send <strong>direct marketing</strong> communications about our products and services that we feel you’ll be interested in. This may be in the form of email, post, SMS, telephone or display advertising you may see on websites, social media, television or search results.</p>
		<p>To protect your privacy rights and give customers choice and control over the use of their <strong>personal information</strong>, you can:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>always ‘opt out’ of receiving <strong>direct marketing</strong> when registering with us, requesting an online quote, purchasing a product or service online at any time. All our marketing communications include unsubscribe links to help you manage your marketing preferences.</li>
			<li>change your marketing preferences in MyAviva (if you’re registered) or by <a href="#contactUs">contacting us</a> if you change your mind. Opting out of one type of marketing, for example, by email or telephone, doesn’t mean you’re opted out of all marketing. Bear this in mind when you manage your preferences. You can always contact us directly if you would like us to stop all forms of direct marketing. We try to limit <strong>direct marketing</strong> and only send you offers and promotions that you might be interested in, based on information we have about you. We won’t send you spam.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We rely on third-party advertising technology (such as the deployment of cookies or small text files on our website) to collect information about you, which is used to optimise what you may see on our websites and deliver content when you are browsing elsewhere. We may also collect information about your use of other websites. We do this to provide you with advertising that we believe may be relevant for you, as well as to improve our own products and services.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Our online advertising complies with the best practice recommendation set by the European Advertising Alliance and you will always see the blue logo on display ads visible on third-party sites.</li>
			<li>You can turn off this type of advertising by visiting: youronlinechoices.com and adjusting privacy settings in your browser.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If we use or share information with online sources, such as websites, social media and information sharing platforms, we will respect any permissions you have set about how you would like your <strong>personal information</strong> to be used.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you in MyAviva and on social media platforms you use as they will dictate how adverts and other messages are displayed and shared across those platforms.</li>
			<li>If you choose to opt out of tailored offers and advertising, you’ll still continue to see generic advertising displayed online, it just might not be as relevant to you.</li>
			<li>For further information about cookies and other technologies we use on our website, please see our <a href="/legal/aviva-cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 id="personalInformation"><strong>2.3 Using personal information to improve our products and services</strong></h5>
		<p>We use digital tools when you visit our websites or use our mobile apps to gain insights into our products, services and the functionality and performance of our websites, apps and platforms. For example, we use some of these tools to save your language preferences on our website, so we’re able to offer you our services in the language you prefer.</p>
		<p>To learn more about these technologies and how you can change your browser settings to manage your privacy controls, see our <a href="/legal/aviva-cookie-policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>. If you have downloaded one of our mobile apps, we recommend that you also refer to the app’s privacy policy.</p>

		<h5 id="creditReference"><strong>2.4 Working with Credit Reference Agencies (CRA)</strong></h5>
		<p>For certain products, to ensure we have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, help prevent fraud and provide you with our best premium and payment options, we may obtain information relating to you at quotation, renewal and, in certain circumstances, where policy amendments are requested. This may include a quotation search that will appear on your credit report and be visible to other credit providers.</p>
		<p>Where you agree to pay monthly under an Aviva credit agreement, the status of your quotation search from our CRA will be updated to reflect your credit application and this will be visible to other credit providers. CRAs may keep a record of this search.</p>
		<p>To assess your application we’ll supply your <strong>personal information</strong> to our CRAs and they’ll give us information about you, such as your financial history. We do this to assess creditworthiness and product suitability, check your identity, <strong>manage</strong> your account, trace and recover debts and prevent criminal activity. We’ll also continue to exchange the information about you with CRAs on an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs will share your information with other organisations. Your data will also be linked to the data of your spouse, any joint applicants or other financial associates.</p>
		<p>Our CRA and the ways in which it uses and shares <strong>personal information</strong> are explained in more detail here.</p>

		<h5 id="fraudPrevention"><strong>2.5 Working with regulators and fraud prevention and detection agencies</strong></h5>
		<p>We may use your personal information to help us to detect and prevent fraudulent applications and <strong>claims</strong>, fight <strong>financial crime</strong> and meet our regulatory responsibilities. This may involve checking public registers (eg the electoral roll or registers of county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions), conducting online searches from websites, social media and other information sharing platforms and using databases managed by credit reference agencies see <a href="#creditReference">here</a> for more details and other reputable organisations. This will help us verify your identity, make decisions about providing you with our products and related services, and trace debtors or beneficiaries. We may also share your information and undertake searches with third party organisations such as police, public bodies, credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies and our regulators (which include the <strong>FCA</strong>, <strong>PRA</strong> and <strong>ICO</strong>).</p>
		<p>If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we’ll record this to prevent further fraud and money laundering.</p>
		<p>We can supply on request further details of the agencies and databases we access or contribute to and how this information may be used. If you require further details contact us at Policy Investigation Unit, Aviva, Cruan Business Centre, Westerhill Business Park, 123 Westerhill Road, Bishopbriggs, Glasgow G64 2QR. Telephone 0345 300 0597. Email: <a href="mailto:PIUUKDI@AVIVA.COM">PIUUKDI@AVIVA.COM</a> or using the <a href="#contactUs">details below</a>.</p>

		<h5 id="reinsurers"><strong>2.6 Working with Reinsurers</strong></h5>
		<p>We may share (either directly or through <strong>brokers</strong>) your <strong>personal information</strong>, including <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, with reinsurers who provide reinsurance services to Aviva and for each other in respect of risks <strong>underwritten</strong> by Aviva and with insurers who cover Aviva and under its group insurances policies. They will use your data to decide whether to provide reinsurance and insurance cover, assess and deal with reinsurance and insurance claims and to meet legal obligations. They will keep your data for the period necessary for these purposes and may need to disclose it to other companies within their group, their agents and third party <strong>service providers</strong>, law enforcement and regulatory bodies.</p>
		<p>We can supply on request further details of the reinsurers and insurers we provide your data to and how this information may be used. If you require further details contact us.</p>

		<h5 id="createProfiles"><strong>2.7 Using personal information to create profiles and create better products</strong></h5>
		<p>Where we <strong>underwrite</strong> products, we use an automated underwriting engine to <strong>process</strong> the <strong>personal information</strong> you provide as part of your application <strong>process</strong>, together with information provided by third party sources (this could include sensitive information such as <strong>health information</strong> and <strong>offences and convictions</strong>) along with the amount of cover you wish to obtain. Other data may be used to calculate these decisions such as <strong>telematics data</strong> which may have been collected from your vehicle (for motor insurance) or your device. We do this to calculate how much that cover will cost you. Without this information we’re unable to provide a price that is relevant to your individual circumstances and needs.</p>
		<p>We regularly check the way our underwriting engine works and before using data obtained from third parties we rigorously test it to identify whether the data provides any actionable insight. This is done using the bare minimum amount of hashed or obscured data we hold about our customers. We do this in order to continually improve the quality of our services, the efficacy of our algorithms and to help us to continue to be fair to our customers.</p>
		<p>If you are making a <strong>claim</strong>, we may use <strong>profiling</strong> or other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your <strong>claim</strong> may be fraudulent or suspect in some way.</p>
		<p>Where <strong>sensitive personal information</strong> is relevant to the <strong>profiling</strong>, such as medical history for life insurance or <strong>offences and convictions</strong> for motor insurance, your <strong>sensitive personal information</strong> may also be used in the <strong>profiling</strong> models.</p>
		<p>You have certain rights in respect of this type of <strong>automated decision making</strong>. To learn more about your rights <a href="#yourRights">click here</a>.</p>

		<h5 id="retainingInformation"><strong>2.8 Retaining personal information in our systems</strong></h5>
		<p>We generally only keep <strong>personal information</strong> for as long as is reasonably required for the reasons explained in this privacy policy. We do keep certain transactional records - which may include <strong>personal information</strong> - for more extended periods if we need to do this to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For instance, we’re required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.</p>
		<p>To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data deletion.</p>
		<p>We may also retain personal information where we have identified a legal basis for doing so in an aggregated form which allows us to continue to develop/improve our products and services.</p>

		<h5 id="protectingInformation"><strong>2.9 Protecting information outside the UK</strong></h5>
		<p>Some of the organisations we share information with may be located outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of information outside the EEA is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>transfers within the Aviva Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your <strong>personal information</strong> receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Group;</li>
			<li>where we transfer your data to non-Aviva Group members or other companies providing us with a service, we’ll obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your <strong>personal information</strong>. Some of these assurances are well recognised certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of <strong>personal information</strong> transferred from within the EU to the United States of America</li>
			<li>we’ll only transfer <strong>personal information</strong> to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights; and</li>
			<li>any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully validated before <strong>personal information</strong> is disclosed</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You have a right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. To learn more, please read <a href="#yourRights">your rights</a> section.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>We may not always be able to comply with your request, for example, if we need to keep using your <strong>personal information</strong> in order to comply with our legal obligation or where we need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

		<h5 id="restrictInformation"><strong>3.4 Restricting our use of personal information</strong></h5>
		<p>You can ask us to restrict our use of your <strong>personal information</strong> in certain circumstances, for example, where:</p>
		<ul>

			<li>our use of your <strong>personal information</strong> is not lawful but you do not want us to erase it</li>
			<li>the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected but we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>

		<h5 id="automatedDecisions"><strong>3.7 Contesting decisions based on automated decision making</strong></h5>
