								<span class="bannerbig">Privacy Statement</span>
								<p>Since your privacy is important to us, Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. has created this privacy statement in order to let you know our firm commitment to your privacy.</p>
								<p>The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. websites <a href="http://www.avs4you.com/index.aspx">http://www.avs4you.com</a></p>
								<h1>Information collection</h1>
								<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you register for our software, or you want to provide us with your personal data, to give us the opportunity to get in touch with you.
									<br>When you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.
									<br>When you register, we may ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, and serial number.
									<br>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for any other purposes.
									<br>When a user submits personal information, it is kept on a private server not accessible from the Internet. This limits the possibility of any malicious use of your information.
									<br>Visitors can change or correct information about themselves contacting us via <a href="support.aspx">support form</a>
									<br>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of our websites anonymously. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration. Only the domain name from which you access the Internet, the Internet address and the date and time you access our web sites are logged. Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. uses this information to analyse trends and to measure the number of visitors to our web sites.
								</p>
								<h1>Use of personal information</h1>
								<p>Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. may share non-personal, summary information regarding its customers with partners or other third parties. However, for partners or third parties under contract with Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd., any individual customer information provided may be used solely to perform or complete a necessary transaction or function related to the customer's purchase. These transactions or functions shall be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties mentioned above, without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. does not sell registrant information to lists. In some cases, Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue.

									<br>Online Media Technologies&nbsp;Ltd. may send the user information or updates about special offers, programs, new products and/or services via e-mail. The user are able to unsubscribe from the mailing list any time after receiving the first information message.
