<br><br>
We do not collect any personally identifying information from you unless you expressly consent to the terms and conditions of this statement when you register on the website or purchase our products from the website. Upon receiving your express consent, we only collect such personally identifying information that we specifically need - for example, to send you a brochure, to put you in contact with a local independent sales representative, to fulfil an order or to provide account details. 
<br><br>
If you do not want us to collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We gather non-specific information on the numbers of visitors to certain areas of our website without asking for your consent to do so. We monitor website usage in this manner to help us continually improve the design and layout of our website.
<br><br>
If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that information for the following purposes:
<br>- We may store and process the information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. 
<br>- We may retain information for invoicing and delivery purposes after you make a purchase of our products.
<br>- We may retain information about your previous purchases in order to customise our website services for your future visits to the website.
<br><br>
In addition, we may use your e-mail address to send you information about new products or special offers which we think may be of interest to you, to advise you of important changes to the website or for other marketing purposes. You will be asked if you wish to be take part in this by clicking on the 'opt in’ box provided.
<br><br>
We may also disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. 
<br><br>
Wherever you provide personal information about yourself, you will see the 'information padlock' symbol. This is an official symbol of the Data Protection Commissioner/National Consumer Council, and it is there to alert you to the fact that your personal information is being collected. (You can click on the symbol at any time to return to this page for more information.) 
<br><br>
All of your personal information will be stored securely for the duration of your relationship with us and for 2 years thereafter.
<br><br>
Personal information provided to us on our website may be transmitted over the Internet. Transfers of personal information may therefore take place, potentially, to any country in the world.
