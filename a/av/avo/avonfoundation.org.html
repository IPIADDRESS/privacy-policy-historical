    Avon Products, Inc. (referred to as "AVON", "we", "us" and "our") respects
    the privacy of every individual who visits our Websites and online areas,
    participates in interactive bulletin boards or forums, or purchases AVON
    products on-line. This statement outlines the information AVON will collect
    and how we will use that information. This Security and Privacy Statement
    will apply to your use of AVON.COM, YOURAVON.COM, or any other Website owned
    or operated by AVON ("AVON WEBSITES"). This policy statement will also
    instruct you on what to do if you want AVON to remove your personal
    information collected or stored during previous visits to the AVON WEBSITES.

    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#666666" size="2">AVON will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that
    is, your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) unless you
    provide it to us voluntarily. We will collect information from the AVON
    WEBSITES in several ways. If you register for an online account, we will ask
    you for personal information including your name, zip code, e-mail address
    and phone number. This personal information will be stored in your personal
    profile. Once you have submitted this information and chosen both a valid
    username and password, you will be able to take full advantage of using the
    AVON WEBSITES. When you make a purchase from the AVON WEBSITES, we will also
    ask for your credit card information, as well as, billing and shipping
    information. We will send out confirming e-mails whenever you register or
    make a purchase, to inform you that we received your personal information or
    to confirm your purchase. <br>
    If you do provide us with personal information, we may retain and use that
    information for several purposes. First, we may store and process the
    information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our
    products and services. Second, we may retain information about your previous
    purchases of AVON products in order to customize our Website services for
    your future visits to the site. Third, we may use your e-mail address to
    send you updates about new products, specials and other items of interest.
    If you have already submitted this information and would like to remove it,
    you can delete this information from your personal profile. However, if you
    made a purchase, we will need to retain certain information for billing and
    shipping purposes. <br>

    When you place an order through an eRepresentative, your order may be

    process your order will be shared with your personal eRepresentative. Except
    as stated above or when necessary to share your information with AVON's
    agents or contractors for the purposes of performing services for AVON, your
    personal information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or
    other information) will not be provided to any third party without your
    prior consent. We have restricted our agents and contractors from using your
    personal information in any way other than to provide the services
    contracted for by AVON. <br>

    We are aware that you may be concerned about the privacy and confidentiality
    of your personal information, including, in the case of a purchase of goods,
    credit card and billing address information. Therefore, we have taken
    precautions to ensure that this information is safe and secure. If you
    registered with us, your online account information is protected by a
    password chosen by you. Access to that online account requires your username
    and password. We recommend that you do not disclose your username and
    password to any other person. Additionally, concerning credit card
    information, we protect your transactions using a technology called Secure
    Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, and most are, your
    sensitive information will automatically be encrypted before being sent over
    the Internet. You should also know that we do not store your credit card or
    ordering information on our Internet server. <br>
    No data transmission over the Internet will be 100% secure. While we take
    steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security
    of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Upon
    receiving your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to
    ensure its security on our systems. However, you are ultimately responsible
