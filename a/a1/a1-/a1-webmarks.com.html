<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p style="padding:20px;"><b>We fully respect your privacy. We do not collect any personal information unless explicitly provided by you.
We use a few very common practices with data obtained during your browsing session in order to make this service possible,
to monitor its performance and to find ways to improve it.</b></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Q-Success, the company that runs this site, respects each individual’s right to personal privacy.
We will collect and use information through our web site only in the ways disclosed in this statement.
This statement applies to information collected at www.a1-webmarks.com.</p>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>Q-Success only collects data that is not personally identifiable by us, unless explicitly provided by you. We use web server logfiles to improve the performance of the site and
to monitor its use. We offer the possibility to provide personal data including an email address during sign-up.</p>

<p>We do employ cookies to identify users after sign-up and login. We do not employ cookies for any other purpose. A cookie is a small text file that our web server places on a user’s computer hard drive to store some information.
The site can be used without accepting cookies, but major functionalities cannot be accessed in that case.</p>

<p>We use Google Adsense as advertising service. Google uses cookies and similar techniques to collect data in the ad serving process. However, Google has no access to private data you provide on this site.</p>

<h2>Information Usage</h2>
<p>The information collected by Q-Success is used to monitor this site's performance and to find ways to improve it.
The information we collect will not be used to create customer profiles based on browsing history.
We will not supplement information collected at our web site with data from other sources.
Email addresses disclosed by users for sign-up are not used by Q-Success for other purposes and are not divulged to any third party.</p>

<p>We do not share data with third parties. The user name you provide during sign-up, which may or may not be your real name, will be visible to others. Other data you provide during sign-up, especially the email address, will be visible only to site administrators.</p>
<p>All information in the User profile other than email address and password is publicly visible unless otherwise noted. If you do not want such information publicly visible, then do not post such information to your User profile. Your user name, however, is always publicly visible.</p>

<p>We offer links to other web sites. Please note: When you click on links to other web sites, we encourage you to read their privacy policies. Their standards may differ from ours.</p>
