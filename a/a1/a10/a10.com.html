<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>
This privacy policy (hereafter the “Privacy Policy”) is applicable to this website (www.a10.com) and to all games and other activities that are offered by us on or through this website (this website and all the webpages that are part of this website and such games and activities are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Website”). SPIL GAMES B.V. (hereafter referred to as “SPIL”), with offices at Arendstraat 23, 1223 RE, Hilversum, the Netherlands, is the responsible party as referred to in the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens). SPIL may use affiliates’ or reputable third parties’ services for the processing of personal data collected on or through the Website. By using or accessing this Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. About Our Website</h2>
<p>
</p><ul class="no-list-bullets">
	<li>1.1 The Website is an online source of games. It offers a diverse, current, and exciting mix of games available on the Internet, from SPIL as well as games from partners of SPIL and independent developers. The visitors and players of our Website may choose to register and save games on their profile on the Website. Also, visitors of the Website will be able to rate games they do and do not like, and browse specialized categories and the homepage to find new games added daily as well as the top rated and most popular games on offer. You can play online games by browsing our game content or choosing one of our specialized categories.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>2.	The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
The information our Website collects contains (amongst others) the following categories:<br>
a) IP address, Cookies and Web Beacons
</p><ul class="no-list-bullets">
	<li>2.1	When you visit our Website, our servers automatically save your computer’s IP address. IP addresses will be collected along with information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Website. If you arrive at the Website via a link from another website, the URL of the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.
	</li>
	<li>2.2 In addition we store certain information from your browser using “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience on the Website, including to: 
	<ul class="no-list-bullets">
		<li>(a)	operate and improve offerings through the Website;</li>
		<li>(b)	help authenticate you when you are on the Website;</li>
		<li>(c)	remember your preferences and registration information, as applicable;</li>
		<li>(d)	present and help measure and research the effectiveness of SPIL’s offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications; and</li>
		<li>(e)	customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the Website.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>2.3	SPIL may also use ad network providers to help us present advertisements on the Website. These ad network providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to help presenting, better targeting, and measuring the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. SPIL offers some services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to SPIL in order to deliver these services. SPIL processes such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </li>
	<li>2.4	SPIL may also use third party payment service providers (“PSP”) offering payment transaction services to SPIL in order to sell a product or service through the Website. Whenever you buy something from the Website (e.g. a virtual game item or a subscription for a game download), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours.</li>
	<li>2.5 SPIL may share demographic information (certain anonymous  information about you as a user, such as user age and country) with certain ad network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. </li>
<li>2.6 Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can opt-out of receiving cookies from certain third-party advertising networks by resetting your browser. However, some features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled. </li>

We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and networks through our Website. When your privacy settings permit it, other users may be able to see and supplement your profile (e.g. by posting comments). </li>

		<li>(iv) to deliver messages which you approved to receive (for example from other participants to your social network).</li>
	</ul>

<li>2.10 Without your approval we will not: </li>
	<ul class="no-list-bullets">
		<li>(a)	make your emailaddress visible on the Website;</li>

Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to such personal data and other content, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any content you post on the Website will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of personal data or content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your personal data or content.</li>
	<li>6.2 We have implemented appropriate measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect online. Your personal data visible at the Website (such as any public comments posted by you and/or any data in your profile) are accessible to third parties and you acknowledge and agree that such third parties are able to copy such information to their own websites or other locations.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>7. Miscellaneous</h2>

	<li>7.3 SPIL has an internal notification system to communicate with players under the age of 13. Such underage users will be told not to submit any personal data without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. We may register personal information from such users in case we have received consent from a parent or legal guardian. We may require parents to provide us with additional documentation in order to identify themselves to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data.</li>
	<li>7.4 Our Website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.</li>
	<li>7.5 In the event of a transfer of the Website to a third party, we may transfer to such third party all personal information that we collected about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In such event users who have provided email addresses to us will be notified when information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
	<li>7.6 We also have Terms of Use that are applicable to your use of the Website. In case of a contradiction between the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy prevails.</li>
