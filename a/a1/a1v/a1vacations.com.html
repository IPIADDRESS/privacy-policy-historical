<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><br>
<p>
	A1Vacations.com is serious about protecting the privacy of our owners and our renting visitors. We use information 
	collected about you only to process and bill orders and to make our Web site a more useful and valuable service. We respect 
	the privacy of those who visit or become advertisers. Our privacy policy is stated below, but please be aware that should you 
	follow a link on our Web site to another Web site, you are no longer covered by this policy.  It's a good idea to understand 
	the privacy policy of any Web site before sharing personal information with it.
</p>
<h2>Your Information: What, How, and Why?</h2>
<h3>Property Owners/Advertisers and Vacation Planning Visitors</h3>
<p>
	In order to process a request you may have, we need to know contact information that could include all or some of the following: 
	your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of an advertising listing, a method of payment. 
	A1Vacations will use this information to contact you from time to time with critical customer updates 
	and information, or to send you information about new services or opportunities. You will be able to "unsubscribe" 
	and not receive marketing information, but we must always be able to e-mail you critical information about your account and 
	our mutual business relationship.
</p>
<p>
	Your information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in the case of special promotions by A1Vacations,
	 or one of its partners, about which you've requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs services on behalf of 
	 A1Vacations and has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit 
	 card payment or the conduct of an online survey for example);  and 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple 
	 A1Vacations advertisers and visitors where individual personal information is not disclosed. 
	 A1Vacations shares Web site usage information about advertisers and visitors with a third-party 
	 tracking company for the purpose of reporting statistics. For this purpose, some of the pages you visit on our Web 
	 site use pixel tags (also called clear gifs). A1Vacations also uses your information to market 
	 its services and to gain feedback on potential new services.
</p>
<h3>Newsletters</h3>
<p>
	As an advertiser or visitor to A1Vacations.com, you will receive either or both of our Owner or Traveler newsletters. 
	You may cancel your subscription to these newsletters at any time.
</p>
<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>
	Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our visitors. From time to time, we request owner or 
	newsletter subscribers' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey 
	is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.
</p>
<h3>Inquiries</h3>
<p>
	Site visitors may send inquiries to our property owners/advertisers via clickable links on A1Vacations 
	listings. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your e-mail address 
	and any other information you supply, will be visible to the owner of the property you inquired about so that they might 
	reply directly to you. Do not share information in the e-mail that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, 
	but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are sent to both the individual owner/advertiser 
	you selected and retained by A1Vacations. The resulting inquiry is available for review only by the 
	owner/advertiser to whom they were initially addressed and to A1Vacations customer service employees, 
	who may be asked by advertisers for their past inquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with a
	ny other party, A1Vacations.com may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt 
	of the inquiry e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage via these third party tracking systems.
</p>
<p>
	All inquiries sent through A1Vacations are accepted and are governed by our Terms and Conditions of 
	Service and our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2>How Do We Protect Your Information Once We Have It?</h2>
<p>
	All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store credit card numbers or identifying information on 
	any A1Vacations.com server.  All such information is stored by Paradata, our credit card processing 
	partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its proprietary methods.
</p>

<br><br>
<p>
	Please remember that many services and transactions are performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our 
	security or common practices do not apply to other companies.
</p>
<h2>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?</h2>
<p>
	A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later 
	be read back from that browser. A1Vacations.com may uses cookies to store some personal preferences for your 
	future visits. Cookies allow us to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site can be more 
	personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in 
	much the same way we use them here at A1Vacations.
</p>
<p>
	We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your Web site visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of 
	serving our pages, these third parties may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. These companies 
	may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to 
	A1Vacations.com and other Web sites in order to help us understand how to serve you better.
</p>
<p>
	By using our Web site and signing up for A1Vacations services, you consent to the collection and use 
	of the previously mentioned information by A1Vacations and our affiliates. This policy is subject to 
	change without notice. Privacy issues represent a growing concern for all Web users. To keep up-to-date with our policies, 
	please check this page frequently. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any 
	time.
</p>
<h2>What information do we share with Rentors.org?</h2>
<p>
	A1Vacations is a founding member of Rentors.org. Many of our subscribers have pre-existing relationships 
	with Rentors.org, which provides services to property owners including but not limited to the universal calendar and guestbook.
</p>
<p>
	If you wish to use our calendar, you must be a member of Rentors.org. In order to make this easy for you, we share information, 
	such as your name and your property ID with Rentors.org so that updates you make to your calendar while on A1Vacations.com 
	will update the calendar you have on Rentors.org or on the other Web sites where you have posted your Rentors.org calendar. You do 
	not need to register with Rentors.org, because we pass only the information Rentors.org requires through to them so that they can 
	properly update calendars and guest books as they change from time to time.
