			<div class="title">AOTA Privacy Statement </div>
<p>This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for <a href="http://www.aota.org/">www.aota.org</a> of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA).</p>
<p>AOTA is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users� trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices. AOTA agrees to notify you of:</p>

	<ul type="1">
	
		<li>What personally identifiable information of yours or 
  third-party personal identification is collected from you through the web site 

  
		</li><li>The organization collecting the information 
  
		</li><li>How the information is used 
  
		</li><li>With whom the information may be shared 
  
		</li><li>What choices are available to you regarding 
  collection, use and distribution of the information 
  
		</li><li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to 
  protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under [NAME OF COMPANY] 
  control 
  
		</li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </li>
	</ul>
<p>If you feel AOTA is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact Paula A. Steib, Communications Director at <a href="mailto:paulas@aota.org;">paulas@aota.org;</a> 301-652-2682, ext. 2961. </p>

<br><br>

<div class="subtitle">Information Collection and Use </div>
<p>AOTA is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. AOTA collects information from our users at several different points on our web site.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Registration</div>
<p>To access areas designated as "member areas" users must be current members of AOTA. The information collected when joining AOTA is used to control access to these areas of the website. Each AOTA member who wishes to use the "member areas" of the website will be required to enter their current AOTA member number, zip code and email address. This information is used to verify the user's account and in turn provide an added security feature so that accounts are not used by anyone other than the AOTA member. The user's e-mail address is used to send verification e-mails that provide the user with a copy of any online changes to their AOTA account.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Online Orders</div>
<p>We request information from the user on our membership form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer�s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Cookies</div>
<p>There are two types of cookies. The standard cookie is a piece of data stored on the user�s hard drive containing information about the user. The second type of cookie is called a "per-session" cookie. These cookies also store information about a user. However, these cookies are not stored on the user's hard drive. These cookies are only used while the user is actively using a website. Once the user closes their browser (or is inactive for more than 20 minutes), these "per-session" cookies are destroyed.</p>
<p>AOTA uses both types of cookies on the web site. </p>
<p>AOTA uses permanent cookies in two ways. When a visitor arrives at our site, a unique cookie is written to the user's machine to allow analysis software to differentiate between new and returning users. This cookie is written automatically to the user's machine. The second way a permanent cookie is written is only when a user opts to save their logon information. This saves time for users by not having to enter security information on each visit to the site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site but they will have to manually login to access our "member areas."</p>
<p>Finally, "per-session" cookies are used while a user is active on the AOTA site. These cookies allow the user to navigate freely through the site once they have logged in to the site. Without these cookies, the user would have to login each time a "member area" page was requested. These types of cookies are also used while a user is joining, renewing, or altering account information. This allows the web site to keep track of a user's activity before any data is committed to a database.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Log Files</div>
<p>Each view of a page on the AOTA site is logged. We record information such as the user's IP address, time of day, duration of activity on the site, and other activity information. This information is used by AOTA to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p>IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information unless any illegal activity is detected on our site. Only under such circumstances would AOTA attempt to connect an IP address to personal information.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Sharing</div>
<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. </p>
<p>We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to process online credit card payments for services such as joining or renewing AOTA membership or subscribing to OT Search. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>
<p>We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. </p>
<p>These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Links</div>
<p>The AOTA web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AOTA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Surveys</div>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Security</div>
<p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. </p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just �surfing�. </p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in a combination locked room. Only a very limited number of employees have access to this room. Furthermore, our servers are all password protected. The server that stores personal data is not accessible via Internet or wide area network. Only local users are able to access this server.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to <a href="/helpdesk.asp">helpdesk@aota.org</a>.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Special Offers</div>
<p>AOTA sends all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Site and Service Updates</div>
<p>AOTA also sends the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. </p>
<div class="subtitle">Correction/Updating Personal Information:</div>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done from our member services page or by e-mailing our Membership Department. Because of legal reasons some information, like a user's name change, must be changed by calling the membership department.</p>
<div class="subtitle">Choice/Opt-out</div>
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our e-mail newsletters or promotional materials&nbsp; may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the e-mail.</p>

<div class="subtitle">Notification of Changes</div>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
