		<p>AOL is committed to the privacy of our members. We want you to know how we protect member 
		information and what choices you have about its use. </p>

		<p>In addition, for visitors to AOL's website aol.com.au, we <!-- have employed <a href="http://www.redsheriff.com/uk/6.0.0.htm" 
		target="_blank">RedSheriff</a> to --> collect general information that will not personally identify you. This information 
		simply provides statistics for the purpose of gaining insights into how people use our Website.</p>
		
		<p><strong>THE AOL PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
		
		<p>We regard our members' privacy as one of our most important values. We want you to know how we protect 
		member information and what choices you have about its use.  We believe AOL's Privacy Policy should 
		give you confidence whenever you use AOL or AOL.COM.AU -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year.</p>
		
		We have organised our policy into three parts: 
		
		<ol>
		<li>We outline our Eight Principles of Privacy, our core commitment to protect your privacy.</li><br><br>
		
		<li>We explain how we implement each principle.</li><br><br>
		
		<li>We provide Helpful Tips on how you can better protect your privacy in cyberspace.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>AOL'S PRIVACY COMMITMENT: THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF PRIVACY</strong></p>
		
		<p>We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. Our Eight Principles of Privacy summarise and clarify that 
		commitment: how we safeguard your privacy, how we treat personal information, and what choices 
		you have. We understand that for you to take full advantage of the benefits of this interactive medium, we 
		must do everything we can to ensure that your privacy is secure. AOL may use or disclose, and you consent to, 
		use or disclose your information in circumstances which are explained in this Privacy Policy or 
		permitted under the National Privacy Principles.</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>We do not read your private online communications. <br><br>
		</li><li>We inform you how we will use any information about where you personally go on AOL or the Web, 
		and when we will give it out to others. <br><br>
		</li><li> We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names, unless you 
		authorise us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and billing information at any time.<br><br>
		</li><li> We may use information about the kinds of products you buy from AOL to make other marketing offers to you, 
		unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others.<br><br>
		</li><li> We give you choices about how AOL uses your personal information. <br><br>
		</li><li> We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children.<br><br>
		</li><li> We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access 
		in order to safeguard your personal information.<br><br>
		</li><li> We will keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information, 
		and we will advise you if we change our policy. <br><br>
		</li></ol>
		
		<p><strong>(1) We do not read your private online communications. </strong></p>
		
		<p>AOL honours the confidentiality of its members' private communications in private chat rooms, 
		e-mail (including downloads), and Instant Message conversations, as well as any profile data you may create, 
		such as a stock portfolio. AOL does not read or disclose private communications except to comply with 
		legislation, legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, to protect the company's 
		rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. Of course, what 
		you write or post in public or member chat rooms and message boards is available not only 
		to AOL, but to all members. AOL may monitor such communications.</p>
		
		<p>We do not read you private emails or Instant Messages, and we do not keep records of these, except 
		in the circumstances where other members may have notified AOL if they discovered that you have included 
		offensive, illegal or harmful material in the Instant Message or private email. AOL will consider 
		wether an action needs to be taken and act accordingly. AOL reserves the right to retain 
		a record of the complaint and the material complained about. </p>
		
		<p><strong>(2)  We inform you how we will use any information about where you personally go on AOL or the Web, and when we  give it out to others. </strong></p>
		
		<p>Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on our service. 
		
		We inform you how we will use any of this navigational data about where you -- as an individual member -- 
		go on the service and when we share any of this data with outside companies.</p>
		
		<p>We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our members as a group use the 
		service so that we can make AOL better. We may also share this statistical information with our partners or 
		other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information.  </p>
		
		We do not keep track of where you go on the World Wide Web.<br><br>
		
		<p>The Web sites you visit may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all. We encourage you 
		to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal information.<br><br>
		
		We will release specific information about your account only to comply with legislation or legal process 
		such as search warrant, subpoena or cort orders, or in special cases such as physical threat to you or 
		other circumstances permitted under the Privacy Principles.</p>
		
		<p><strong>(3) We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information or screen names, unless you 
		authorise us to do so.  And we give you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and billing information at any time.</strong></p>
		
		<p>When you join AOL, we ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and billing information-including the credit card 
		used to pay for your account -- and the various screen names you want to use on your account. Here is how we protect that information:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>AOL will not give out your telephone number or screen names (e-mail addresses), except where needed to deliver a 
		product or service you ordered. <br><br>
		</li><li>We will not give out your credit card number information unless you authorise it, for example, during an online purchase. <br><br>
		</li><li>We will not give out information that would link your screen names with your actual name. However, when 
		you check your monthly bill at Keyword: Billing you will see your full name displayed. This is to comply with GST regulations.<br><br>
		</li><li>We make lists of members' names and addresses available to pre-screened companies who have specific 
		direct mail product and service offers we think may be of interest to you.  We also sometimes combine these 
		lists with publicly available information or segment them based on other information, such as when a member 
		joined AOL or a member's computer system type.  These lists are never based on a member's online activities. <br><br>
		</li></ul>
		
		<p>You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide to other companies. 
		For more information about your choices, please see Principle 5. (Keyword: Marketing Prefs) </p>
		
		<p>We also collect and use other information for internal purposes. For example, we keep records in your account history of 
		complaints, your contact with AOL Member Services and any reported violations of our Terms of 
		Service (TOS) that you or someone on your account may have committed. AOL automatically queries your computer 
		for information about your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have 
		received, or whether you use Windows(TM) software -- to help us fit the service to your individual needs and to help us 
		diagnose problems you may be having with your system. Finally, we sometimes use information about your 
		geographical location to provide localised service. For example, we may use your postcode or the time zone 
		you are in to make sure the weather information or TV listings you see are accurate for you.</p>
		
		<p>We have three exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about your account only to comply 
		with legislation, legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases 
		such as a physical threat to you or others. </p>
		
		<p>We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct your contact and billing information that we have 
		on file. Just as you want to make sure that information AOL has about you is accurate, we want to keep 
		only the most up-to-date information about your account. Therefore, whenever you believe that your 
		contact or billing information needs updating, you can go to Keyword: Billing  and make 
		the necessary changes.</p>
