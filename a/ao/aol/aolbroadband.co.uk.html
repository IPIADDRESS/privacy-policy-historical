  <p class="article_body"> Our systems automatically gather information about your use of the AOL Access Services and we may use this together with other aggregated information to improve our services and personalise your experience of the AOL Access Services. We also use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our customers as a group use the service so that we can make our service better. We may also share this statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information. </p>
  <p class="article_body"> <strong>We do not keep track of where you personally go on the World Wide Web</strong>.</p>

  </ol>
  <p class="article_body"> The Web sites you visit should have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal data.</p>

    <p class="article_body"> When you join the AOL Access Service, we ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and Billing Account information - including the credit card, bank account, or debit card used to pay for your account. Here is how we protect that information:</p>
    <ul class="article_body">
    <li> We will not give out your telephone number or screen names (e-mail addresses), except where needed to deliver a product or service you ordered. </li>
    <li> We will not give out your Billing Account information unless you authorise it, for example, during an online purchase. </li>
  </ul>
    <p class="article_body"> We make lists of customers' contact information available to other companies within the Carphone Warehouse Group of companies and to pre-screened third-party companies who have product or service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment them based on other information, such as when a customer joined us or a customer's computer system type. These lists are never based on a customer's online activities.</p>
    <p class="article_body"> You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide to other companies. For more information about your choices, please see <a href="#p5">Principle 5</a>.</p>
    <p class="article_body"> We also collect and use other information for internal purposes. For example, we keep records in your account history of your complaints about other customers' online behaviour, your contact with our Customer Services department and any reported violations of our terms and conditions) that you or someone on your account may have committed. Our systems and software automatically query your computer for information about your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have received, or whether you use a particular type of software or hardware to access the internet - to help us fit the service to your individual needs and to help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system.</p>
    <p class="article_body"> We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about your account only to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others.</p>
    <p class="article_body"> We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct your contact and billing information that we have on file. Just as you want to make sure that information we have about you is accurate, we want to keep only the most up-to-date information about your account.

In addition, we use other information such as when customers joined us, how often they use the service or their type of computer system to make such offers. We also use publicly available consumer data to help us decide which marketing offers to make and which advertising they see. </li>

  <p class="article_body"><strong>  <a name="tips" id="tips"></a> SOME TIPS TO HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY ONLINE </strong></p>
  <p class="article_body"> You can take the responsibility to protect your personal privacy online. Here is a checklist that will help safeguard your privacy and protect the integrity of your computer and AOL Access account. We urge you to print these tips and post them near your computer for you and your children.</p>
  <ol class="article_body">
    <li> Never give your password to anyone online. Never give your billing information except to facilitate a purchase. </li>
    <li> Make your password at least 6 characters in length. Create a password that includes a combination of numbers and letters (such as sun8ray or bel3jar2 or 12hat93). Be sure to use different passwords for each screen name on your account. </li>
    <li> If you have fallen for an online scam and given out your password, change your password right away. Before you sign off, go to <a href="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/password" title="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/password">http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/password</a> and create a new password for your screen name. Also, change the passwords for any other screen names on your account. </li>
    <li> Your computer can catch a virus by simply opening an e-mail, so exercise caution if opening an email from someone you don’t know and consider installing virus detecting software. If an e-mail asks for a password or billing information, or contains a suspicious file attachment from someone you don't know, go to <a href="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/notify" title="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/password">http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/notify</a>  to learn how to report it. </li>
    <li> Never download files unless you know what they are and who sent them to you. Computer viruses and destructive programs that could cause your computer to divulge personal information are often transferred in cleverly disguised files. </li>
    <li> When you go on the Web, you may want to check the sites you visit to see if they have a privacy policy. Take special care to protect your personal information and your screen name, since the operators of Web sites are not bound by the TPH Services Sàrl Privacy Policy. </li>
    <li> Explain to your children that some contests or prize draws provided by other parties could ask them for personal information, and make very clear what information they may or may not provide, under any circumstances. </li>
    <li> You can get instructions to report any violation by going to <a href="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/notify" title="http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/password">http://myaolbroadband.co.uk/notify</a>. </li>

  <br>
  <br>AOL is a  global organisation, and many of the computers and companies that process  information on our behalf are based in the USA and other countries outside the  European Economic Area (the "<strong>EEA</strong>"). This means that your  Personal Information (which may include information you provide about your  racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical  beliefs, or trade union membership, or concerning health or sex life) may be  transferred to, processed and held both inside and outside the EEA.</p>
<p class="article_body">These  countries may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.&nbsp; However, if we transfer your information  outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy  rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection  law and this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Details of  companies and countries processing your information will be provided on  request, by writing to AOL (UK) Limited, Legal Department 68 Hammersmith  Road, London, W14 8YW. </p>
<p class="article_body"><b>How long will you  keep my Personal Information?</b>

  <br>We may retain your Personal Information as long as is  necessary for the purposes for which we collected it, or for the period to  which you consent under the AOL Web Services Agreement, as explained here or  under the specific terms applicable to your use of the AOL Web Services, or as  is otherwise required by applicable law.&nbsp; We may process your Personal  Information for a reasonable period after your use of the AOL Web Services ceases.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="article_body">If you have purchased any paid for AOL Web Services from AOL  we may retain payment-related information, such as a payment  card number which you supplied to us (but only in an anonymised form which does  not enable us to identify the holder of that payment method) for an unlimited  period after your paid for AOL Web Services or Web Services Account has been  cancelled for fraud prevention purposes.&nbsp; <a href="#Principle4">Read More</a></p>
