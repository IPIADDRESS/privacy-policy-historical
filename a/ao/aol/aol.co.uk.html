<h2><br>
    <a name="#pp1"></a>Privacy Policy for visitors to AOL.co.uk</h2>
<p class="Copy">AOL is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of users
  of its interactive products and services as well as to respecting the Data
  Protection Acts 1984 and 1998. Throughout the Net we want to contribute to
  providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, to
  ensure that kids' information is protected. </p>
<p>While this privacy policy applies to the AOL.co.uk site and all of the other
  Internet-accessible AOL-branded services, such as AOL Instant Messenger, we
  will refer here only to AOL.co.uk to make reading this policy easier. The AOL
  UK online proprietary service has a separate privacy policy for its members.
  You can view that <a href="#pp3">privacy policy here</a>. The purpose of this
  AOL.co.uk privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to AOL.co.uk,
  what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit AOL.co.uk,
  how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the
  choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information.
  Finally, please note that this policy applies only to AOL.co.uk and Web sites
  that carry the AOL.co.uk brand, and not to the Web sites of other companies
  or organisations to which we may link. We have clearly marked AOL.co.uk and
  these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. </p>
<p>Personal data will be collected, processed and used by AOL (UK) Limited, its
  affiliates and licensors for the purpose of providing the AOL service and related
  services. AOL is global, and many of the computer systems that provide it are
  currently based in the United States. Thus, your personal data will be transferred
  to, processed and held in the United States and in other countries within the
  European Union. </p>
<p><strong>Information About All AOL.co.uk Visitors </strong></p>
<p> In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like
  the numbers and frequency of visitors to AOL.co.uk and its areas. This information
  is very much like television ratings that tell the television networks how
  many people tuned in to a programme. We only use such data in aggregate form.
  This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use specific
  parts of our site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing
  as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, AOL.co.uk uses
  a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site
  are visited, and by how many people. AOL cookies do not collect personally
  identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through
  cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are
  or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information,
  but never information which could identify you personally, to our AOL.co.uk
  partners about how our members, collectively, use AOL.co.uk. We do this so
  they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order
  for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. </p>
<p><strong>Information About You</strong></p>
<p> Sometimes, we may specifically ask you for information about you when you
  sign up to use a service, like AOL Instant Messenger, or when you order a product.
  We will need certain information -- such as your name, Internet address or
  screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order
  to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information
  to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be
  interested. You can easily choose not to receive such information if you don't
  want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for
  the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests
  so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online
  medium, but the provision of such information is always optional..</p>
<strong>Disclosure</strong>
<p> We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to AOL.co.uk
  or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address
  or telephone number, to any outside companies. But as we mention above, we
  may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information
  about the use of AOL.co.uk.</p>
<p><strong>Special Attention to Kids</strong></p>
<p> AOL takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people
  using our services. We do not specifically collect information about children
  and believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out
  any personal information. We encourage you to participate in your child's online
  experience and to review our important safety tips before your child explores
  the Internet.. AOL also recommends that parents who are AOL members use AOL's
  Parental Controls or other Web filtering technology to supervise their kids'
  access to the Web. </p>
<strong>AOL UK Privacy Policy Changes </strong>
<p> If we decide to change our privacy policy for AOL.co.uk, we will post those
  changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we
  might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>

<h2><a name="#pp2"></a>Privacy Policy for registered customers</h2>
<p> We regard the privacy of the data we hold about our customers as one of our
  most important values. We want you to know how we protect your data and what
  choices you have about its use. We believe this privacy policy should give
  you confidence whenever you use AOL - 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365
  days of the year. </p>
<p> We have organised our policy into three parts: </p>
<ol>
  <li> We outline our Eight Principles of Privacy, our core commitment to protect
    your privacy. </li>
  <li> We explain how we implement each principle. You can click on any principle

<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="1a" id="1a"></a></span>(1) We do
    not read your private online communications </strong></p>
<p> AOL honours the confidentiality of its members' private communications in
  private chat rooms, email (including downloads), and Instant Message™ conversations,
  as well as any profile data you may create, such as a stock portfolio. AOL
  does not read or disclose private communications without your consent to third
  parties except where we or an entity processing your data on our behalf is
  compelled to do so by law, or in response to a valid, legally compliant request
  by a competent authority, to protect the company's rights and property, or
  during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. Of course, what
  you write or post in public or member chat rooms and message boards is available
  to the public. </p>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="2a" id="2a"></a></span>(2) We do
    not use any information about where you personally go on aol.co.uk and we
    do not give it out to others. </strong></p>
<p> Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on
  aol.co.uk. </p>
<p> We do not use any of this navigational data about where you - as an individual
  member - go on the service. Nor do we share any of this data with outside companies. </p>
<p> We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our
  members as a group use aol.co.uk so that we can make AOL better. We may also
  share this statistical information with our partners or other outside companies,
  but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational
  information. </p>
<p> We do not keep track of where you personally go on the World Wide Web. </p>
<p> We may use cookies and other analogous technologies to improve your online
  experience. </p>
<p> We may use these technologies to personalise and enhance your experience
  on our service, including to: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Maintain data that you voluntarily give us about your preferences, such
    as your personal interests. </li>
  <li> Personalise features of aol.co.uk, like providing you with your local
    weather forecast or custom news bulletins. </li>
  <li> Validate participation in select online activities, such as making sure
    that each person only votes in an online poll once. </li>
  <li> Authenticate your access to your personal data for added security. </li>
</ol>
<p> AOL and its advertisers may use these technologies to determine on an anonymous
  basis which advertisements registered customers may have seen and how registered
  customers responded to them. For example, these cookies may be used to help
  ensure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, to show the next
  advertisement in a series, or to tell whether an anonymous registered customers
  responded to a particular ad. These cookies are not used to collect personally
  identifiable data unless you give us permission to do so. </p>
<p> AOL and its advertisers may also use small pieces of code called "web
  beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregated
  advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising
  responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that
  conform to our anonymous cookie policy. AOL does not allow advertisers or their
  advertising networks to use these technologies on registered customers to compile
  profiles about the different Web sites that a particular member visits. </p>
<p> <strong><span class="CopyTitle"><a name="3a" id="3a"></a></span>(3) We do
    not give out your telephone number or screen name unless you authorise us
    to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct the personal information
    we hold about you at any time.</strong></p>
<p> When you register for a screen name you will provide us with personal information.
  Here is how we protect that information: </p>
<ul>
  <li> AOL will not give out your telephone number or screen names (email addresses),
    except where needed to deliver a product or service you ordered. </li>
  <li> We will not give out information that would link your screen names with
    your actual name. </li>
</ul>
<p> We make lists of your contact information available to pre-screened companies
  who have product or service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also
  sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment
  them based on other information, such as when you became a registered customer.
  These lists are never based on your online activities. </p>
<p> You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we
  provide to other companies. For more information about your choices, please
  see Principle 5. </p>
<p> We also collect and use other information you give us for internal purposes.
  For example, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints
  about other members' online behaviour, your contact with AOL Member Services
  and any reported violations of our Terms of Service that you may have committed.
  Finally, we may, if you have provided it to us, sometimes use information about
  your geographical location to provide localised service. For example, we may
  use your post code to make sure the weather information or TV listings you
  see are accurate for you. </p>
<p> We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information
  about your account only to comply with valid legal process such as a search
  warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases such as a physical threat
  to you or others. </p>
<p> We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct the personal details
  that we hold about you. </p>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="4a" id="4a"></a></span>(4) We may
    use information about the kinds of products or services you may buy from
    AOL to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We
    do not give out this purchase data to others </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Purchases From AOL</strong></p>
<p> We will record information about any purchases which you may make from AOL
  or its affiliates on aol.co.uk. If you buy from us online, our system automatically
  gathers purchase data, and we also record information about purchases that
  may be made through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing operations. </p>
<p> We may use this information in the following ways: </p>
<ol>
  <li> We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our registered
    customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings
    in the same way that other companies change their catalogue based on what
    sells best. </li>
  <li> We use information such as the number of purchases members make and the
    categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to you that we believe
    will interest you. In addition, we use other information such as when you
    registered for a screen name and how often you use aol.co.uk. We also use
    publicly available consumer data to help us decide which marketing offers
    to make and which advertising they see. </li>
</ol>
<p> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL. For more information
  about your choices, please see Principle 5. </p>
<p> We do not give out any information about what you, as an individual, may
  purchase from AOL, except to complete your transactions, or otherwise as set
  out in this privacy policy. We share with outside companies only statistical
  information about what AOL products or services our members - as a group -
  buy. </p>
<p><strong>Your Other Online Purchases through aol.co.uk</strong></p>
<p> For all other online purchases, be sure to review the merchants' privacy
  policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have
  privacy terms that differ from AOL's privacy policy, and they may use personal
  information which you may provide them differently than our policy permits. </p>
<p> AOL may be involved in facilitating your purchases from these other companies,
  but this individual data is not used for any other purpose. </p>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="5a" id="5a"></a></span>(5) We give
    you choices about how AOL uses your personal information </strong></p>
<p> You have choices about how the information you have provided may be used
  by us to make special offers to you. And you can direct us to remove your contact
  details such as your name and address from mailing lists we provide to selected,
  pre-screened companies. </p>
<ul>
  <li> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from third parties about
    their products and services by post. </li>
  <li> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by post. </li>
  <li> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by telephone. </li>
  <li> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by email. </li>
  <li> You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL through online "pop-up
    screens." </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="6a" id="6a"></a></span>(6) We take
    extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children </strong></p>
<p> We recognise that particular concerns exist concerning children and young
  people and&nbsp;believe it is important to support discussion between children
  and their parents as to their safety and the content they may access online.&nbsp; We
  have special privacy policies to protect children and teens using content on
  aol.co.uk which is specifically designed for them.&nbsp; We also provide our
  access customers with specific additional technical and educational products,
  content and services to ensure that they have the ability to restrict their
  children's access and we urge parents to teach their children about protecting
  their personal information while online. </p>
<p>In areas designed for children, AOL and its partners will not collect names,
  addresses, telephone numbers or other personally identifiable information without
  disclosing how that information will be used and notifying&nbsp;children that
  they should obtain permission from their parents before providing any information. </p>
<p>You can learn more about how to ensure a safe and enjoyable online experience
  for you and your family by visiting our Safety and Security area. </p>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="7a" id="7a"></a></span>(7) We use
    secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee
    access in order to safeguard your personal information </strong></p>
<p> We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information - including
  your billing and account information - as secure as possible. We also have
  put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your
  personal data remain safe and private </p>
<p> Each and every AOL employee must abide by AOL's privacy policy. Only authorised
  AOL Group employees are permitted to have access to your personal information
  and such access is limited by need. For example, if you call our Member Services
  department with a concern or complaint, the representative is allowed to access
  only the personal information that he or she needs to address your concern.
  In addition, any company with which AOL contracts to be our agent in conducting
  our business is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements to ensure
  that your information remains safe and secure. </p>
<p> All AOL employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will
  comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies
  are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. </p>
<p> We strongly encourage our content, commerce and advertising partners to clearly
  post their own privacy policies and to have privacy control systems in place
  to protect your personal information. Be sure to review their privacy policies
  and contact them directly if you have any questions. </p>
<p><strong> <span class="CopyTitle"><a name="8a" id="8a"></a></span>(8) We will
    keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal
    information, and we may advise you if we change our policy </strong></p>
<p> A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is explaining to
  you how we may use your personal information. This privacy policy serves that
  purpose, and it is accessible through the Privacy Policy link on the footer
  of aol.co.uk. </p>
<p> Whenever we materially change our policy, we may give you 30 days' notice
  of those changes by email. However, you are responsible for regularly reviewing
  this policy. Your ongoing use of aol.co.uk after any new changes take effect
  signifies your agreement to the revised privacy policy. </p>
<p> Business transfers. The online world and our business continue to evolve,
  and we may purchase or sell business units, take over other companies, (or
  we may ourselves be taken over) or carry out corporate reorganisations. In
  such transactions, customer information may form one of the transferred business
  assets. Any entity receiving such personal data will remain bound to this privacy
  policy. </p>
<p> This privacy policy should be should be read subject to the following: We
  may disclose data about your account if we or an entity processing your data
  on our behalf is compelled to do so by law or in response to a valid, legally
  compliant request by a competent authority, or with your consent. </p>

    weather forecast or custom news bulletins.</li>
  <li>Validate participation in select online activities, such as making sure
    that each person only votes in an online poll once.</li>
  <li>Authenticate your access to your personal data for added security.</li>
</ol>
<p>AOL and its advertisers may use these technologies to determine on an anonymous
  basis which advertisements members may have seen and how members responded
  to them. For example, these cookies may be used to help ensure members don't
  see the same advertisement too many times, to show the next advertisement in
  a series, or to tell whether an anonymous member responded to a particular
  ad. These cookies are not used to collect personally identifiable data unless
  you give permission to do so.</p>
<p>AOL and its advertisers may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear
  gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregated advertising metrics, such as counting
  page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may
  be used to deliver cookies that conform to our anonymous cookie policy. AOL
  does not allow advertisers or their advertising networks to use these technologies
  on AOL to compile profiles about the different Web sites that a particular
  member visits. </p>
<p>The Web sites you visit, including those of AOL's advertisers and partners,
  should have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy
  policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal data.</p>
<p><span class="CopyTitle"> <a name="3b" id="3b"></a><strong>(3) We do not give
      out your telephone number, Billing Account information or screen names,
      unless you authorise us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct
      your personal contact and billing information at any time</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>When you join AOL, we ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and
  Billing Account information- including the credit card, bank account, or debit
  card used to pay for your account - and the various screen names you want to
  use on your account. Here is how we protect that information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;AOL will not give out your telephone number or screen names
    (email addresses), except where needed to deliver a product or service you
    ordered. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not give out your Billing Account information unless
    you authorise it, for example, during an online purchase.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not give out information that would link your screen
    names with your actual name. </li>
</ul>
<p>We make lists of members' contact information available to pre-screened companies
  who have product or service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also
  sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment
  them based on other information, such as when a member joined AOL or a member's
  computer system type. These lists are never based on a member's online activities. </p>
<p>You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide
  to other companies. For more information about your choices, please see Principle
  5. </p>
<p>We also collect and use other information for internal purposes. For example,
  we keep records in your account history of your complaints about other members'
  online behaviour, your contact with AOL Member Services and any reported violations
  of our Conditions of Service (COS) that you or someone on your account may
  have committed. AOL automatically queries your computer for information about
  your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may
  have received, or whether you use a particular type of software or hardware
  to access AOL - to help us fit the service to your individual needs and to
  help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system. Finally, we sometimes
  use information about your geographical location to provide localised service.
  For example, we may use your post code to make sure the weather information
  or TV listings you see are accurate for you.</p>
<p>We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information
  about your account only to comply with valid legal process such as a search
  warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases such as a physical threat
  to you or others. </p>
<p>We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct your contact and
  billing information that we have on file. Just as you want to make sure that
  information AOL has about you is accurate, we want to keep only the most up-to-date
  information about your account. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact
  or billing information needs updating, you can go to AOL <strong>Keyword</strong>:
  Billing and make the necessary changes.</p>
<p class="CopyTitle"> <a name="4b" id="4b"></a><strong>(4) We may use information
    about the kinds of products or services you buy from AOL to make other marketing
    offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase
    data to others.</strong></p>
<p> <b>Your Purchases From AOL</b></p>
<p>AOL offers our members the opportunity to buy AOL shop direct merchandise,
  such as computer hardware and software, and other products or services that
  may carry the AOL brand. Like other retailers and direct marketers, we record
  information about such purchases. When you buy from us online, our system automatically
  gathers purchase data, and we also record information about purchases made
  through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing operations.</p>
<p>We may use this information in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li> We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our members
    as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings in
    the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells
    best.</li>
  <li>We use information such as the number of purchases members make and the
    categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to you that we believe
    will interest you. In addition, we use other information such as when members
    joined AOL, how often they use the service or their type of computer system
    to make such offers. We also use publicly available consumer data to help
    us decide which marketing offers to make and which advertising they see.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL. For more information
  about your choices, please see Principle 5.</p>
<p>We do not give out any information about what you, as an individual, purchase
  from AOL, except to complete your transactions, or otherwise as set out in
  this privacy policy. We share with outside companies only statistical information
  about what AOL products or services our members - as a group - buy. </p>
<p> <b>Your Other Online Purchases Through Our Service</b></p>
<p>For all other online purchases, be sure to review the merchants' privacy policies
  and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy
  terms that differ from AOL's privacy policy, and they may use personal information
  which you may provide them differently than our policy permits.</p>
<p> AOL may be involved in facilitating your purchases from these other companies,
  but this individual data is not used for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="CopyTitle"> <a name="5b" id="5b"></a><strong>(5) We give you choices
    about how AOL uses your personal information</strong></p>
<p>You have choices about how the information you have provided may be used by
  us to make special offers to you. And you can direct us to remove your contact
  details such as your name and address from mailing lists we provide to selected,
  pre-screened companies. To activate any of these marketing preferences, go
  to Keyword: Marketing Preferences. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may choose not to receive marketing offers from third parties
    about their products and services by post.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by
    post.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by
    telephone.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by
    email. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL through
    online "pop-up screens." </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="CopyTitle"><a name="6b" id="6b"></a><strong>(6) We take extra
      steps to protect the safety and privacy of children</strong></span></p>
<p>Young people need special safeguards and privacy protection. We realise they
  may not understand all the provisions of our policy or be able to make thoughtful
  decisions about the choices available to adult members. So we have special
  privacy policies to protect kids and teens using areas on the service specifically
  designed for them, including our Kids Only Channel. And we urge all parents
  to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas on the service designed for children 12 and under,
    AOL and its partners require prior parental consent (for example, by sending
    in a permission form by regular mail or by fax) before collecting or using
    names, addresses, telephone numbers or other information that identifies
    a child offline. In addition, prior to children using screen names on the
    AOL service, we require parental (master account) consent at the time the
    subaccount screen name is created. We do this so that parents are aware of
    and consent to how their children may use their screen names; for example,
    using the screen name to request an online newsletter, to post a message
    on a message board or to participate in a chat room. Please read our important
    note to parents to learn more about AOL's practices regarding children's
    online privacy.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas designed for teens 13 through 15, AOL and its partners
    may not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers or other personally identifiable
    information without disclosing how that information will be used and notifying
    teens that they should obtain permission from their parents before providing
    any information. </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way parents can control their child's experience online
    is AOL's Parental Controls (Keyword: Parental Controls). These simple, flexible
    tools allow parents to customise content and functionality to their child's
    maturity level. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since one master account may have up to seven screen names, we encourage all
  parents to use their master account to create separate screen names for each
  child. This allows the parent to customise AOL to their child's maturity level
  and content needs: Kids Only (recommended for children 12 and under); Young
  Teen (recommended for ages 13-15); or Mature Teen (recommended for ages 16-17).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unsolicited email is a problem for everyone, but it is particularly a problem
    for children. This includes mail that could contain content you may not want
    your children to see, or mail that may ask for information you would not
    want your children to give out.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to minimise the unsolicited email your children receive, you can
  use Mail Controls (Keyword: Mail Controls) to block all email from the Internet
  or to select the email addresses from which you wish to allow your children
  to receive email. Remember that screen names and information voluntarily given
  by children and teens in public chat rooms, email exchanges, message boards,
  the Member Directory, and other online communications are publicly available
  and may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited email. </p>
<p>You can learn more about how to ensure a safe and enjoyable online experience
  for you and your family at Keyword: Safety. </p>
<p class="CopyTitle"> <a name="7b" id="7b"></a><strong>(7) We use secure technology,
    privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order
    to safeguard your personal information</strong></p>
<p>We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information-including
  your billing and account information - as secure as possible. We also have
  put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your
  personal data remain safe and private </p>
<p>Each and every AOL employee must abide by AOL's privacy policy. Only authorised
  AOL Group employees are permitted to have access to your personal information
  and such access is limited by need. For example, if you call our Member Services
  department with a concern or complaint, the representative is allowed to access
  only the personal information that he or she needs to address your concern.
  In addition, any company with which AOL contracts to be our agent in conducting
  our business is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements to ensure
  that your information remains safe and secure.</p>
<p>All AOL employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will
  comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies
  are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. </p>
<p>We strongly encourage our content, commerce and advertising partners to post
  clearly their own privacy policies and to have privacy control systems in place
  to protect your personal information. Be sure to review their privacy policies
  and contact them directly if you have any questions.</p>
<p class="CopyTitle"><a name="8b" id="8b"></a><strong>(8) We will keep you informed,
    clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information,
    and we will advise you if we change our policy</strong></p>
<p>A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is explaining to
  you how we may use your personal information. This privacy policy serves that
  purpose, and it is accessible through several means within our service. When
  you register for our service, you are presented with the main terms of our
  privacy policy and should familiarise yourself with this and all other AOL
  policies at that time. In addition, this policy is easily located in our Conditions
  of Service area Keyword: COS. </p>
<p>Whenever we change our policy, we will give you 30 days' notice of those changes
  through prominent disclosures, including notification on our front screen.
  If policy changes are substantial, we will notify each of our members individually
  through pop-up screens or emails. Since pop-ups last only for a limited time,
  however, you should sign on to your account regularly for these and other important
  announcements.</p>
<p>Business transfers. The online world and our business continue to evolve,
  and we may purchase or sell business units, take over other companies, (or
  we may ourselves be taken over) or carry out corporate reorganisations. In
  such transactions, customer information may form one of the transferred business
  assets. Any entity receiving such personal data will remain bound to the Privacy
  Policy set out here and in the Member Agreement.</p>
<p> The AOL Privacy Policy set out above should be should be read subject to
  the following: We may disclose data about your account if we or an entity processing
  your data on our behalf is compelled to do so by law or in response to a valid,
  legally compliant request by a competent authority, or with your consent.</p>
<p class="CopySmall"> If you'd like to comment on or have questions about our
  privacy policy, or if you have a concern or policy violation you wish to report,
  you can email us at <a href="mailto:datainfouk@aol.com">datainfouk@aol.com</a>,

<p><span class="CopyTitle"><strong>TEN TIPS TO HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
      AND SECURITY ONLINE</strong></span></p>
<p>You can take the responsibility to protect your personal privacy online. Here
  is a checklist that will help safeguard your privacy and protect the integrity
  of your computer and AOL account. We urge you to print these tips and post
  them near your computer for you and your children.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Never give your password to anyone online. Never give your billing information
    except to facilitate a purchase.</li>
  <li> Make your password at least 6 characters in length. Create a password
    that includes a combination of numbers and letters (such as sun8ray or bel3jar2
    or 12hat93). Be sure to use different passwords for each screen name on your
    account.</li>
  <li> If you have fallen for an online scam and given out your password, change
    your password right away. Before you sign off, go to Keyword: Password and
    create a new password for your screen name. Also, change the passwords for
    any other screen names on your account.</li>
  <li> Setting up a Member Profile about yourself can be a good way of connecting
    with communities of AOL members. But be aware that Member Profiles are public.
    It's a good idea to avoid including information that could allow people to
    find you offline, such as your phone number or exact street address.</li>
  <li> Use AOL's Mail Controls™ feature at AOL Keyword: Mail Controls to
    control the email you and your children receive. You can block email from
    the Internet, entire domain names and specific email addresses. You can even
    block the exchange of attached files or pictures in email.</li>
  <li> Your computer can catch a virus by simply opening an email, so exercise
    caution if opening an email from someone you don't know and consider installing
    virus detecting software. If an email asks for a password or billing information,
    or contains a suspicious file attachment from someone you don't know, go
    to Keyword: Notify AOL to learn how to report it.</li>
  <li> Never download files unless you know what they are and who sent them to
    you. Computer viruses and destructive programs that could cause your computer
    to divulge personal information are often transferred in cleverly disguised
    files.</li>
  <li> When you leave the AOL environment to go on the Web, you may want to check
    the sites you visit to see if they have a privacy policy. Take special care
    to protect your personal information and your screen name, since the operators
    of Web sites are not bound by AOL's privacy policy.</li>
  <li> Explain to your children that some non-AOL contests could ask them for
    personal information, and make very clear what information they may or may
    not provide, under any circumstances.</li>
  <li> You can get instructions to report any violation by going to Keyword:
    Notify AOL.</li>
