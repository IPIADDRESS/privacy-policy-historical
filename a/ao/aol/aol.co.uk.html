            <b>AOL's privacy policy - an overview</b><br>
              <br>
            AOL UK is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of users of 
            its interactive products and services as well as to respecting the 
            Data Protection Acts 1984 and 1998. Throughout the Net we want to 
            contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, 
            and in particular, to ensure that kids' information is protected. 
            <p>While this privacy policy applies to the AOL.co.uk site and all 
              of the other Internet-accessible AOL-branded services, such as AOL 
              Instant Messenger, we will refer here only to AOL.co.uk to make 
              reading this policy easier. The AOL UK online proprietary service 
              has a separate privacy policy for its members. If you are an AOL 
              member, you can find that policy within our Conditions of Service 
              area. The purpose of this AOL.co.uk privacy policy is to inform 
              you, as a welcome visitor to AOL.co.uk, what kinds of information 
              we may gather about you when you visit AOL.co.uk, how we may use 
              that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices 
              you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the 
              information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only 
              to AOL.co.uk and Web sites that carry the AOL.co.uk brand, and not 
              to the Web sites of other companies or organisations to which we 
              may link. We have clearly marked AOL.co.uk and these branded Web 
              sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. </p>
            <p>Personal data will be collected, processed and used by AOL Inc. 
              for the purpose of providing the AOL service and related service. 
              AOL is global, and many of the computer systems that provide it 
              are currently based in the United States. Thus, your personal data 
              will be transferred to, processed and held in the United States 
              and in other countries within the European Union. </p>
            <p><b>Information about all AOL.co.uk visitors</b> <br>
              In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information 
              like the numbers and frequency of visitors to AOL.co.uk and its 
              areas. This information is very much like television ratings that 
              tell the television networks how many people tuned in to a programme. 
              We only use such data in aggregate form. This collective data helps 
              us determine how much our customers use specific parts of our site, 
              so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as 
              we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, AOL.co.uk 
              uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when 
              pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. AOL cookies 
              do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not 
              combine information collected through cookies with other personally 
              identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your 
              screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical 
              "ratings" information, but never information which could identify 
              you personally, to our AOL.co.uk partners about how our members, 
              collectively, use AOL.co.uk. We do this so they too can understand 
              how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to 
              provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. </p>
            <p><b>Information about you</b> <br>
              Sometimes, we may specifically ask you for information about you 
              when you sign up to use a service, like AOL Instant Messenger, or 
              when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such 
              as your name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, 
              type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that 
              service or product to you. We may also use that information to let 
              you know of additional products and services about which you might 
              be interested. You can easily choose not to receive such information 
              if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen 
              when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for 
              information about your interests so that both you and we can take 
              advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but the provision 
              of such information is always optional..</p>
            <p> <b>Disclosure</b> <br>
              We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits 
              to AOL.co.uk or information that you may give us, such as your name, 
              address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. 
              But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners 
              aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of AOL.co.uk.</p>
            <p><b>Special attention to kids</b> <br>
              AOL takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young 
              people using our services. We do not specifically collect information 
              about children and believe that children should get their parents' 
              consent before giving out any personal information. We encourage 
              you to participate in your child's online experience and to review 
              our important safety tips before your child explores the Internet.. 
              AOL also recommends that parents who are AOL members use AOL's Parental 
              Controls or other Web filtering technology to supervise their kids' 
              access to the Web. </p>
            <p><b>AOL UK privacy policy changes</b> <br>
              If we decide to change our privacy policy for AOL.co.uk, we will 
              post those changes here so that you will always know what information 
              we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will 
              disclose it to anyone.<br>
