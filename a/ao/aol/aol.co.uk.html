<p class="article_body"><strong>AOL's Commitment to protecting your privacy</strong></p>

<p class="article_body">A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is to explain how we may use the personal information we collect, the choices you have about its use, and the steps we take to help protect your privacy whilst you interact with AOL.</p>

<p class="article_body">In the provision of the web based <a href="http://help.aol.co.uk/helpnotsearchable/aol-sites-pages-services-and-software/article/20070131100709990010">sites, pages, AOL Web Services and software</a> (collectively the "<b>AOL Web Services</b>") AOL (UK) Limited, our subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies (together the "<b>AOL Group Companies</b>") <b>("AOL" or "we" or "our") </b>and other data processors acting under our control may collect, process, store and use aggregate information, and any information which may identify you or your Web Services Account (your "<b>Personal Information</b>") in various different ways and for different purposes. AOL collects this information when you give this to us or when you interact with the AOL Web Services.</p>

<p class="article_body">Access to some of the AOL Web Services may require you to complete a registration process and to open an account with AOL (the "<b>Web Services Account</b>"). When you go through this Web Services Account registration process, you are presented with the main terms of our Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is also easily found online by clicking on the Privacy Policy links on AOL's Web Sites, or at <a href="http://www.aol.co.uk/privacy/">www.aol.co.uk/privacy</a>.</p>

<p class="article_body">AOL controls the Personal Information you provide to us when you register and when you use the AOL Web Services. We will process your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the AOL <a href="http://www.aol.co.uk/webservicesagreement">Web Services Agreement</a> and applicable law, and we take responsibility for the processing, disclosure, and use of that information, including use by a third party on our behalf. When you register and by using the AOL Web Services you agree to this use.</p>

<p class="article_body"><strong>AOL's Privacy Commitment: The Seven Principles of Privacy</strong></p>

<p class="article_body">Here we outline our Seven Principles of Privacy, which summarise and clarify AOL's commitments to protect your privacy.
</p><ol class="article_body">
<li><strong>We are straightforward about what Personal Information we collect, and how we use it.We tell you how you can contact us with any questions or suggestions you may have</strong><br>
We tell you what Personal Information we collect and how we use it; where it will be stored and long it will be kept and we tell you how we will notify you if this Privacy Policy changes and how to contact us to. <a href="#pr1">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We may personalise your experience based on how you use the AOL Web Services, including where you go on the AOL Web Services.</strong><br>
When you use the AOL Web Services you are not anonymous - for example when you log in using your Screen Name - we can identify you as an individual when you visit AOL and we may personalise your experience based on the information you submit and how you use the AOL Web Services. <a href="#pr2">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We give you choices about how AOL uses your Personal Information.</strong><br>
You can edit your Personal Information, set your marketing preferences, or find out more about how to set or change other product controls and preferences which make the AOL Web Services more relevant and convenient for you. <a href="#pr3">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We do not give out any Personal Financial Information you may provide us with, unless you authorise us to do so.  And we give you the opportunity to correct your personal details at any time.</strong><br>
When you use AOL Web Services, which incur a charge, we may ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and payment details in order to take a payment from you. However, we will not give out such information unless you authorise it. <a href="#pr4">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We do not read your private online communications.</strong><br>
We respect the confidentiality of your private communications, like e-mail and Instant Messages. We do not read or disclose these communications except in limited circumstances (such as in response to a court order). <a href="#pr5">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We use technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to help safeguard your Personal Information.</strong><br>
We use technology to help keep your Personal Information as secure as it reasonably can be. <a href="#pr6">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>We take extra steps to help protect the safety and privacy of children.</strong><br>
Young people need special safeguards and privacy protection. We have special privacy practices to help protect kids and teens when they use the AOL Web Services specifically designed for them. <a href="#pr7">Read more</a></li>
</ol><p></p>

<p class="article_body">AOL's Privacy Policy is subject to the following important provisions:</p>

<p class="article_body">We (or data processors acting under our control) will only disclose your information to third parties if you have consented (or not objected) to us doing so.However, we may be obliged to disclose information about your Web Services Account in the following circumstances:

<li>in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others; and/or </li>
<li>otherwise in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
</ul><p></p>
