    of information. The following describes our privacy policy regarding

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    3. Modification of Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy 
    Policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy 
    Policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on 
    this site's home page. Your continued use of this site indicates your acceptance

    link periodically for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the 
    top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their 
    effective dates. Regarding personal information, if any modifications are 
    materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information 
    previously disclosed by you, we will obtain your consent before implementing 
    such revisions with respect to such information.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4. Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information. We reserve the right to monitor 
    your use of this site. As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous 
    information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively 
    providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet 
    tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, 
    clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive 
    information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to 
    better understand how this site is being used.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
    4.1 A "cookie" (also known as a "browser cookie") is a text file that this site 
    sends to your browser in the form of a text file The information generated by 
    the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be 
    transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but they 
    usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; however, certain 
    features of this site might not work without cookies.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.2 "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve 
    navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the 
    site "remembers" previous entries of country of origin that were outside the 
    specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate 
    statistical information on the site. They are erased once you exit your Web 
    browser or otherwise turn off your computer.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.3 "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed 
    on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. 
    Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, 
    such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to 
    determine what areas of the site you may find most valuable, and customizing the 
    site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by 
    this site in your computer do not hold personal information.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to 
    notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether 
    to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, 
    please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by 
    your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally 
    considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in many cases 
    an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), 
    rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can 
    be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, 
    determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, 
    and administer and improve the site.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.6 "Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, 
    invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) tell the website server information such as the 
    IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be 
    placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on 
    different pages of the site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened 
    and which information is consulted.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    4.7 "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used 
    for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research 
    purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
<p>
    5. Use and Sharing of Anonymous, Passive Information. This site may make full 
    use of passively collected anonymous information, including without limitation 
    the right to use such information to provide better service to site visitors, 
    customize the site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and 
    trends, and otherwise administer and improve this site for your use. We reserve 
    the right to share this anonymous, passive information in aggregated form.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    6. 3rd Party Cookies for Web Analytics. We reserve the right to use web 
    analytics services provided by 3rd parties. These services use 3rd party cookies 
    (cookies passed by others, not by us) to collect anonymous, passive information 
    about your use of this site (see explanation of cookies in Collection of 
    Anonymous, Passive Information above). We may use this information for the 
    purpose of evaluating your use of this site, compiling reports on website 
    activity, and providing other services. These web analytics services may also 
    transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or 
    where such third parties process the information on the service's behalf.

    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    7. 3rd Party Cookies for Serving Behavioral Ads; Flash Cookies.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
    7.1 We reserve the right to serve our ads and third party ads on our site that 
    are targeted to your interests ("3rd Party Behavioral Ads"). 3rd Party 
    Behavioral Ads are served by 3rd party advertising services that use 3rd party 
    cookies (cookies passed by others, not by us) to collect anonymous, passive 
    information about your use of this site and other websites (see explanation of 
    cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information above). This information 
    is your “behavioral data”. 3rd Party Behavioral Ads do not use your personal 
    information. Instead, they associate your behavioral data on visited sites with 
    your computer, so that the ads your computer sees on this site are more likely 
    to be relevant to your interests. These advertising services may also transfer 
    this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such 
    third parties process the information on the service's behalf.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    7.2 The 3rd party advertising services that serve ads on our site may use Flash 
    cookies. Flash cookies are not the same as “browser cookies” (see explanation of 
    cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information above). Flash cookies 
    consist of an Adobe Flash Media Player local shared object (LSO) that is used 
    for tracking purposes. The Adobe Flash Media Player is software that enables 
    users to view content on their computers. Flash cookies are also accompanied by 
    a browser cookie. If you delete the browser cookie, the Flash cookie will 
    automatically create (or re-spawn) a replacement for the browser cookie. For 
    information on how to delete a Flash cookie, visit 
    http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html or search the Web for “How to delete 
    flash cookie”.

    8. Participation in Google’s Adsense Network. We reserve the right to 
    participate in Google's AdSense network for purposes of serving 3rd Party 
    Behavioral Ads (see 3rd Party Cookies for Serving Behavioral Ads above). Google 
    uses DoubleClick's DART cookie in its AdSense network. You may opt out of the 
    use of the DART cookie. For information regarding how to opt out, go to

    &nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
<p>
    9.1 We will ask you for personal information when you sign up ("register") for

</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;</p>
<p>
    9.2 We do NOT tie or link your personal information to anonymous, passive

    regarding the length of time you visit our site (anonymous, passive 
    information).
</p>
<p>
