<h1>www.vBulletin.com (or "Site") Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.  This Privacy Policy applies to your information that we collect and receive on and through this Site; it does not apply to practices of businesses that we do not own or control or people we do not employ.</p>

<p>At no time will we sell or otherwise distribute your information or your personally-identifiable data without your permission.  You can visit this Site without revealing who you are or providing any personal information about yourself.</p>

<p>By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use this Site and its services. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>

<h2>Browsing this Site</h2>

<p>If you browse through this Site without entering any personal data, we will gather and store certain information about your visit.

<p>If you request remote support services, such as technical support or software installation or upgrades, we may collect certain information required to fulfill your request.

By taking advantage of these services, you give permission to us and our customer support team to log in to your website server or software control panel, which may contain personal information.</p>

<p>All electronic communications received, either via email to non-personal addresses such as sales@vbulletin.com and support@vbulletin.com, or via the online contact system, are logged and retained for a period from the date of receipt, until such time as information is no longer needed or required by law. Communications from existing Site customers are automatically linked to their respective customer account.  Secure information (including usernames, passwords and server details) submitted via the professional installation worksheet, are deleted from the database 30 days after the installation has been completed, whichever is earlier.</p>
