            <p align="justify"><span><strong>2.1 The Kind Of Information We Collect </strong></span><span><br>
          </span><span>Softroute gathers and uses personal information in order to provide you with the services you have requested or to offer additional services in which you may be interested. Providing us with your personal information is your choice, however, we may not be able to provide you with certain services if you do not provide us with certain information.</span></p>

          </span><span>At Softroute we use personal information for three general purposes: 
            </span>
          </p><div align="justify">
            <ol>
              <li><span>To communicate with you in order to provide you with our services or information. 
                </span>
              </li><li><span>To better understand how we can serve our entire population. 
                </span>
              </li><li>To make a credit assessment if you are applying for credit. </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
            <p align="justify"></p>
            <p align="justify">We will only use personal information for the purpose that we have disclosed to you. If we want to use your information for a different purpose, we will notify you and ask for your consent first. </p>
            <p align="justify"><span><strong>2.3 When We May Disclose Your Personal Information </strong><br>
          </span><span>Softroute is obliged to keep your personal information confidential except under the following circumstances:<br>
          <br>
          * When <strong>Authorized by You</strong><br>
          * When <strong>Required by Law<br>
          </strong>* When <strong>Permitted by Law</strong>          </span>
          </p><p align="justify">(i)<i>When Authorized by You</i><br>
          Many of the services offered by Softroute require us to obtain personal information about you in order to perform the services we have been engaged to provide. We will use this information to tailor products to meet your needs and objectives. We will always obtain consent from you first, and we will never use the information for purposes other than those we have told you about. </p>
            <p align="justify">(ii) <i>When Required by Law </i><br>
          The type of information we are legally required to disclose usually relates to government reporting requirements. However, in some cases, such as under a court order, we may be required to disclose certain information to persons specified in the court order. We will only provide the specific information requested and only upon being satisfied that the authorities have legitimate grounds to request the information. </p>
            <p align="justify">(iii) <i>When Permitted by Law </i><br>
          The legislation has provided certain situations where Softroute is legally permitted to disclose personal information without your consent. Examples include situations involving the collection of debt in arrears, or suspicion of illegal activities. </p>
            <p align="justify"><span><strong>2.4 Who We May Share Your Information With</strong></span><span><strong><br>

Physical access to areas where personal information is gathered, processed or stored is limited to authorized employees only. </span></p>
            <p align="justify">If you telephone a Softroute employee to speak about your file, you may be asked for some personally identifying information. This type of safeguard is designed to ensure that only you, or someone authorized by you, has access to your file. </p>
            <p align="justify"><span><strong>2.6 Web Site Security </strong><br>
