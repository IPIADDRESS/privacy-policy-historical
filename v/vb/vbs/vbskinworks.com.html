				  <p>vBSkinworks.com operates this web site. vBSkinworks regards the privacy and security of user information as a critical component of the service that we offer to our users. The following information explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>

				  <ol>
				   <li>Registration Data - We use Registration Data to give you access to our forums and purchase script.

You may choose to stop receiving future communications from us. Please see the Opt-Out and Discontinue Section below.</li>
				   <li>Cookies - Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.

We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party period! No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners period! Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.

						I just to want to give a big thumbs up to John here at vBSkinworks.
                        I ordered, received and downloaded my skin in less than an hours time. Then I had a problem with my graphics which he fixed for me in the time it took me to have dinner.
                        I wish everybody I dealt with had this kind of customer service!  Thanks again John!<br>
