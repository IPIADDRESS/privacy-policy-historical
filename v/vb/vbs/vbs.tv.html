    <h4 id="a1">THE INFORMATION THE SITE COLLECTS AND HOW WE USE IT</h4>
      <h5 id="a1-1">Information You Provide Us</h5>
        <p>The Site may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, which is information that could be used to contact you or identify you personally, such as your name or e-mail address (“Personal Information”) and other information about you, such as demographic information (your gender, <span class="caps">ZIP</span> code or similar information) or certain information about your preferences and interests. The Site may collect Personal Information and other information about you at various places and forms on the Site, including registration forms, when you submit a question to us, or when you otherwise communicate or interact with us. If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VBS</span> may use your Personal Information: (1) to provide you with information or services that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to process your registration with the Site, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid; (3) to improve the Site or our services, to customize your experience on the Site, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (3) to contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site policies; (4) for internal business purposes; and (5) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information.</p>
<p>You may be able to submit comments, ideas, reviews and suggestions about specific <span class="caps">VBS</span> shows, episodes, entries on the <span class="caps">VBS</span> blog, in response to other users’ comments on the Site and other areas of the Site where you are invited to do so (“User Content”). You may also mark certain videos as favorites and subscribe to particular shows, and this favorite list and list of subscribed shows are publicly displayed on the Site unless you choose not to publicly display them when you register or by modifying your account settings.  You may also be able to create and share playlists and other similar information and your account setting options associated with those lists will be disclosed on the Site.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VBS</span> may publish User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or later developed), except for Personal Information submitted through the registration form that <span class="caps">VBS</span> has designated as “private” on the Site (unless that same Personal Information is included in User Content, in which case, <span class="caps">VBS</span> may publish all of the User Content including any Personal Information contained in that User Content). For example, if you include your name in User Content, <span class="caps">VBS</span> may publish all of the User Content including your name as included in the User Content, even if your name is included in the “private” portion of your account registration.</p>
<p>Please note that information submitted to the Site via a "contact us” or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.</p>

      <h5 id="a1-2">Information In Your Public Profile</h5>
        <p>If you register as a member of the Site, you may create a public profile that includes your screen name, your personal photo, as well as other information that you choose to post about yourself in the portion of your profile designated as public (“Public Profile”). Your Public Profile also includes the list of videos that you mark as your favorites and the list of shows to which you are subscribed (unless you choose, at the time of registration or by later modifying your account, to not make that information publicly available).</p>
<p>Information in your Public Profile, such as your screen name and personal photo, may be posted on the Site along with and associated with your User Content or your User Video Preferences. Additionally, others, including members of the public, that view your User Content can choose to view your full Public Profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you choose to disclose in it.</p>
<p>You may edit the information in your Public Profile by logging in and going into “My Account.” You may terminate your account by using the “Contact Us” feature and sending us your username, password and e-mail address. Please specify “<span class="caps">REMOVE</span>” as the subject and include a note asking us to terminate your account.</p>

      <h5 id="a1-3">Your Disclosure Of Personal Information</h5>
        <p>If you post Personal Information through comment posting areas or in other User Content or in your Public Profile, that Personal Information will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from third parties. <span class="caps">VBS</span> cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in User Content or your Public Profile and cannot ensure that third parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding what information to include in your User Content and Public Profile and when deciding to disclose Personal Information in any public areas of the Site.</p>

      <h5 id="a1-4">Information You Provide About A Third Party</h5>
        <p>If you send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending a video to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person.</p>

      <h5 id="a1-6">Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Site</h5>
        <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you provide to us on the Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain Site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Site. This information may include browser type, operating system, the web page served, the time, and the preceding web page viewed, among other information. We may use this Site usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Site. In addition, your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Site, as applicable (each, a “Device Identifier”) may be collected. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your mobile phone, or other device used to access the Internet (each, a “Device”), and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with your Personal Information. We may use cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts and other technologies to collect Site usage information.</p>
        <p id="a1-6-1"><em>Cookies</em>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to access the Site. Cookies may be used for many purposes including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Site. You may disable cookies using your Device's preferences, but some features of the Site may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
        <p id="a1-6-2"><em>Web Beacons</em>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in the Site's web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails sent were actually opened or to count how many particular videos or links were actually viewed.</p>
        <p id="a1-6-3"><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as which links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our Web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
        <p>We may combine automatically collected Site usage information with your Personal Information. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p>
             
      <h4 id="a2">HOW AND WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</h4>
        <p><span class="caps">VBS</span> may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes unless you consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information. We may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p id="a2-1"><em>When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties</em>. You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third party(s). If you do not agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will not be shared with such third party(s) for direct marketing purposes. If you do agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third party(s) and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) prior to agreeing to receive such information from third party(s). If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.
</p>
			  <p id="a2-2"><em>Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf</em>. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Site, such as hosting the Site, designing and/or operating the Site's features, analyzing users' interactions with the Site, enabling VBS to send you e-mail, or performing other administrative services. We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for VBS.
</p>
        <p id="a2-3"><em>Sweepstakes, Contests And Promotions</em>. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a "Promotion") through the Site that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.
</p>
        <p id="a2-4"><em>Administrative And Legal Reasons</em>. We may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Site's Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Site or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual. We may also use Device Identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
</p>
        <p id="a2-5"><em>Business Transfers</em>. VBS may share Personal Information with its subsidiaries and affiliates for internal business reasons. VBS also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Site, including Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site or component of the Site, such as a database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of VBS's assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.

In addition, the Site may contain links to other third party web sites that <span class="caps">VBS</span> does not control. <span class="caps">VBS</span> is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party web site.
