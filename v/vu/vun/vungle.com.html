Our “Clients” include “Advertisers” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and “Publishers” of applications that want to display relevant ads to end users (“End Users”) of third party applications (“apps”) that use our SDKs, APIs, hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the “Vungle Ad Services”).</p><p>Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free. We work hard to ensure that the ads that pay the app developer bills are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.</p><ol start="2"><li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong> PRIVACY FOR THE VUNGLE AD SERVICES</strong></span></li></ol><p>This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users (“you”) of apps that use the Vungle Ad Services.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.1 What information do we collect?</strong></span></p><p>When you visit an app that uses Vungle technology, we use and deploy “tracking technologies” (see&nbsp;<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-3">Section 2.3</a>, below) to automatically collect certain information about your device. Some of this information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be “personal data” in some jurisdictions, including the EU. We collect this information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally (such as your name, address, or email address).</p><p><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-1-more">LEARN MORE</a></p><p>We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal data, with information we may collect about your interactions with other Publisher Client’s Apps and ads served through Vungle’s Platform, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional information to undertake “user matching,” which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have assigned to an End User.</p><p>There may also be situations where Vungle’s SDK is not incorporated into the Publisher Client’s app, but we still receive some of the same data listed above in order to respond to an Ad request from a Publisher Client’s app.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.2 How do we use your information?</strong></span></p><p>We use the information we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent validation partners) for a variety of business purposes. For example, we use the personal information we collect for the following purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>Serving Ads:</strong>&nbsp;To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers to bid on and display ads in that inventory.</li><li><strong>Ad Reporting and Conversions:</strong>&nbsp;Reporting to Advertisers information about when and how End Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website.</li><li><strong>Frequency Capping:</strong>&nbsp;Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.</li><li><strong>Customizing Ads:</strong>&nbsp;To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).</li><li><strong>Performance Analytics:</strong>&nbsp;To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.</li><li><strong>Fraud Detection and Prevention:</strong>&nbsp;Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.</li><li><strong>Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services:</strong>&nbsp;Auditing, researching, and analyzing data in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies function properly.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.3 How do we use tracking technologies to collect information?</strong></span></p><p>We use standard tracking technologies to collect information automatically from your device so that our backend operations can use it to perform many of the functions described in “<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-2">How do we use your information?</a>” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-4">Opt-Out Choices</a>” below.</p><p><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-3-more">LEARN MORE</a></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.</strong></span></p><p>You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing your mobile device settings and&nbsp;<a href="https://vungle.com/opt-out">following the most recent published instructions</a>. If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information described above in&nbsp;<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-2-1">Section 2.1</a>&nbsp;to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your past information, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system. You may also stop the collection of location information by particular apps by changing the preferences on your mobile device.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.5 How Do We Share Information?</strong></span></p><p>Please see Section 4.1,&nbsp;<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-4-1">below</a>&nbsp;for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.</strong></span></p><p>Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients. We require our Clients to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>2.7 Children.</strong></span></p><p>Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply fully with applicable children’s data privacy protection legislation, such as the United States’ Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information. With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system such that the End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User “personal information” used by the Vungle Ad Services would be Publisher-specific unique digital identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) to support Vungle’s internal operations.</p><ol start="3"><li><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong> PRIVACY FOR THE VUNGLE WEBSITES</strong></span></li></ol><p>This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through our websites (such as&nbsp;<a href="https://vungle.com/">https://vungle.com</a>&nbsp;or any other website on which this Notice is posted) and other corporate services, web portals, and dashboards we make available to our Clients and End Users (collectively “Websites”), as well as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>3.1 What information do we collect?</strong></span></p><ul><li><ul><li><strong>Information that you provide voluntarily:</strong>&nbsp;Certain parts of our Websites may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily. For example, when registering for a Vungle account, expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about Vungle or our products and services, subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, Vungle collects personal information from you. The personal information that you are asked to provide (and the reasons why you are asked to provide it) will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information. We will also let you know prior to collection whether the provision of personal information we are collecting is compulsory or may be provided on a voluntary basis and the consequences, if any, of not providing the information.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-3-1-more">LEARN MORE</a></p><ul><li><strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong>&nbsp;When using our Websites, we may automatically collect certain information from your device.

We may collect this information as a part of log files as well as through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies, as explained further under the heading “<a href="https://vungle.com/privacy/#section-3-3">Cookies and similar tracking technology</a>”.</p><ul><li><strong>Information we collect from third party sources:</strong>&nbsp;We may obtain information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, data providers and social media platforms.

Specific measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal !msorm;"><strong>4.6 Data Retention</strong></span></p><p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements or comply with our legal obligations).
