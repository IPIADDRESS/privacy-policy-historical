      </p><p><b><a name="anchor2"></a>Collection of Personal Information </b> 
      </p><p>We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website. To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes. For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our database and to comply with various federal and state laws.

      </p>
	
	<p>
	To participate as a member of our website, or in online activities, special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas ("Interactive Areas" include chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards or auditoriums, article or blog comment areas, SMS text messaging, mobile alerts, and mobile e-mail updates), you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date, gender and affiliation(s) with and within third party website(s) ("personal information"). We may also survey visitors about various topics, including local events and experiences, television viewing preferences and how we can improve our website and services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary. 	</p>
	<p>
	We offer SMS text message mobile alerts and mobile e-mail updates as a text messaging/mobile e-mail service for our restaurant and bar listings. We do not collect the sender's e-mail or telephone number on this feature. 
	</p>
	<p>
We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to operate our membership base, protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our service and website, distribute our newsletters, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in specified activities or Interactive Areas and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website. We may also offer an "Email This” feature that allows visitors to e-mail a link to another person to inform them about the NYMag.com site and our features. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on this feature. 
</p>
<p>
We may also offer an “Email Album” feature that allows members to share their fashion albums with others. If you e-mail your fashion albums to others, the emailed albums will automatically be made public for anyone to access. You can also choose to make your albums private so only you can access them. We do not collect the sender’s e-mail information on this feature. 
</p>
<p>
The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you through our website. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information. This website does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we may collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the web page from which a person enters our site, webpages visited, duration of visit and domain type. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.</p>
<p>
We may produce certain contests, sweepstakes and special events with the support of affiliated or non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by NYMag.com and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions. To the extent there is a conflict between those privacy provisions and this policy, the privacy provisions for the specific event will govern. 
</p>
	
	
	<p><a name="anchor3"></a><b>Use and Collection of Information by Operational Providers </b> 
      </p>
	
	<p>
For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this website (including, without limitation, on-line personals services). Companies other than NYMag.com, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order fulfillment and/or contract services "operational providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us. We will store this information in our membership database. In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in NYMag.com's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with NYMag.com, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested service or order. However, you must read an operational provider's privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online. NYMag.com, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor is the NYMag.com family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by operational providers.

      </p>
	  
	  
	  <p>We only share or disclose your personal information with companies other than NYMag.com when it is required by law, when we believe disclosure would enhance or improve operation of the website or certain website services, to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property and/or when disclosure is consistent with NYMag.com's practices for services that are similarly provided offline. The website may offer you the opportunity to give user reviews, ratings and comments for restaurants, hotels, bars, events, articles or other items, or to participate in Interactive Areas. Your member name may appear next to your user reviews, ratings, comments or other postings or participation in Interactive Areas on the website. Your member name may also appear on a member profile section of the website. We may also use and disclose your member name and reviews and ratings in any other manner in accordance with the Terms of Usage Agreement.</p>
	  <p>NYMag.com is a division of New York Media LLC, doing business in the State of New York as New York Media (DE) LLC. We may in the future share personal information with our parents, partners, affiliates or other entities to conduct joint activities or for other purposes.  </p>
	  <p>
When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may share your personal information with our operational providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the website, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.</p>
<p> 
We may collect and provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

Our website may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of affiliate entities or of advertisers or sponsors which are companies that are not owned or operated by NYMag.com, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These entities may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors.

      </p><p>We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. Credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology. If we decide to share visitor information with other members of the NYMag.com family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website. That said, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information you disclose online since a sufficiently powerful attack from an unauthorized third party, however unlikely, could compromise your data.</p>

      <p></p><p><b>Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy </b> 
      </p><p>We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as NYMag.com deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.

      </p><p><b><span class="blackhdr3"><a name="anchor8"></a></span>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY </b> 
      </p><p>NYMag.com respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen (13). We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen (13). Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen (13). Upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen (13) has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, member name and password from our records.</p>
      <p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; </li>
        <li>To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; </li>
        <li>To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again; </li>
        <li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and </li>
        <li>To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p><p><b>Guidelines for Parents </b> 
      </p><p>By taking responsibility for your children's online computer use, parents can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online. The best way to assure that your children are having positive online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend time with your children while they are online. Have them show you what they are doing and ask them to teach you how to access the services. 
      </p><p>While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives. The same general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while online. 
      </p><p><b><i>Make it a family rule to: </i></b> 
      </p><ul>
        <li>Never give out identifying information-home address, school name, or telephone number — in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be sure you're dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust before giving it out via email. Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name if your service allows it.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Get to know the services your child uses. If you don't know how to log on, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable material.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and ask for their assistance.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online, immediately report this to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. You should also notify your online service. Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or even hear the person it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself. Thus, someone indicating that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a 40-year-old man.  <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that's "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend on the computer. A child or teenager's excessive use of online services or bulletin boards, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem. Remember that personal computers and online services should not be used as electronic babysitters. Be sure to make this a family activity. Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child's bedroom. Get to know their "online friends" just as you get to know all of their other friends. </li>
