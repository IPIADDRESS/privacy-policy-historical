<h2>CERTIFICATION, LICENSURE, AND ACADEMIC ADMISSION TEST SERVICES</h2>

<div class="indent">
<h3>Description of Certification, Licensure, and Academic Admission Test Services.</h3>

<p>We provide testing services as a service provider on behalf of test sponsors (that act as an autonomous data controller) and we provide testing services on behalf of ourselves. The test sponsor is the company or organization that offers certification, licensure, or academic admission testing and controls the test(s) that must be taken to secure such certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission. We collect or receive personal information from certification, licensure, and academic admission testing candidates on behalf of the test sponsor. We use this personal information in order to perform the testing services related to the administration and delivery of certification, licensure, and academic admission testing on behalf of the test sponsor. The information we may collect or receive includes, but is not limited to, your test registration, incident resolution (such as fraud prevention) collection of payment for testing services you’ve requested, your test results of such testing, and communicating with you about certification, licensure, and academic admission testing. Providing your personal information is voluntary, but maybe necessary if you wish to receive certification, licensure, or academic admission testing. We will handle and treat all personal information collected and received by us in connection with certification, licensure, and academic admission test registration and administration in the manner as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information about how the test sponsor may collect and use your personal information we encourage you to review the test sponsor’s privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected for Certification, Licensure, and Academic Admission Test Services</h3>

<p>The personal information that we collect or receive in registering a candidate (“you”) for certification, licensure, or academic admission testing services include: name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, credit/debit card information, company and title. We may also collect or receive the following additional information at registration or in the testing process, as necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to: language, date of birth, social security number, sponsor identification number, employment information, previous examination history, education information, and source of financing for the test. For candidate verification and identification purposes, we may collect all or part of a government-issued identification number and mother’s maiden name.</p>

<p>At the test center, depending upon the test sponsor and/or test security requirements, we may collect your signature, photographic image, a copy of your photo identification, fingerprint and/or palm vein image digitally (for the purposes of identity verification and to protect the security and integrity of the test) and you may be audio- and video-taped while taking the test. We may also collect your fingerprint and/or palm vein pattern when your ID does not meet the requirements of identity verification. Finally, when a certification, licensure, or academic admission test is administered to you, we may collect and score your test responses and then derive a test score and generate a report about your certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission test results.</p>

<p>In the event that you submit a request for an accommodation for your certification, licensure or academic admission test, you may be asked to submit health information records in compliance with your test sponsor’s requirements, including but not limited to, documentation from your physician evidencing your need for the accommodations. We will work with the test sponsor to evaluate your eligibility for an accommodation and if an accommodation is granted we will implement an acceptable accommodation solution.</p>

<h3>Independent Testing Centers</h3>

<p>Certain certification, credentialing, licensure, and academic admission tests are administered through independent authorized testing centers. These authorized testing centers are required to use any data collected in compliance with this Privacy Policy. If you have unaddressed concerns about an independent testing center relating to certification, credentialing, licensure, or academic admission services provided by the Pearson VUE Business Group please contact us at <a href="mailto:PearsonVUE Contracts@pearson.com">PearsonVUE Contracts@pearson.com</a> or you may call us at 1 (952) 681-3918.</p>
</div>
<a name="remote-proctoring-test-services"></a>

<h2>REMOTE PROCTORING TEST SERVICES</h2>

<div class="indent">
<h3>Description of Remote Proctoring Test Services</h3>

<p>If a test sponsor offers their test outside of a Pearson VUE authorized testing center through remote proctoring and if you choose to take the test through Pearson VUE’s remote proctoring platform, you will be monitored over the Internet through your computer via your webcam and microphone. Remote proctoring means that you will log on to a test platform through the internet to take your test and you will be monitored during your entire testing session in real-time so that your face, voice, desk and workspace will be captured and a recording will be made of these images for the purposes of test security and the integrity of the testing process. It is your responsibility to monitor your remote proctored testing environment. You must make sure that only you will be recorded during your testing session and that no one else will be physically in the room where you are testing and that no one speaks to you during your testing session. If at any time during a remote proctored testing session a third party enters the work space or if any third party’s voice is detected on the audio recording your testing session may be immediately terminated and the test stopped. If this event occurs you will not receive a test refund or be credited for any portion of the test fee.</p>

<p>The video and audio recordings are standard test procedures for all test sponsors’ remote proctored tests and your video and audio recording will be used for purposes of identity verification, remote observation, incident resolution, such as fraud prevention, test security, and for the integrity of the test and testing process. For more information about how the test sponsor may collect and use your personal information we encourage you to review the test sponsor’s privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected for Remote Proctoring Test Services</h3>

<p>All of the same personal information that we collect or receive as described above applies to you when you register to take a test sponsor’s remote proctored test. Prior to the start of your remote proctored test you may be required to hold up your ID documentation, (for example your driver license, passport or other approved ID that the sponsor designates), to be recorded on the video for the purpose of identity verification. The collection of such data is optional, but necessary if you choose to use the remote proctoring function. You understand that the audio- and video-tapes of your testing session will be supplied to the relevant test sponsor and any of their appointed agents to assist with their management of your test.</p>
