</blockquote>
<p>

not require that any personal information be supplied in order to download
publicly available files or reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In addition to the VCU Web Privacy Statement, the University encourages its
College, Schools, Departments, Centers, Institutes and other units contributing
to its official web pages to provide specific notices about the collection and
use of any personal information associated with those pages.</p>
