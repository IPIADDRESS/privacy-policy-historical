This information is used to better understand and  improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website.  Please read the “Cookies” section below for more information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharing your personal information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We do not sell or rent your Personal  Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have  granted us permission to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may share your Personal Information  within V-cube, our parent company,  or any of ’s subsidiaries for  purposes of data processing or storage.</p>

We only provide these third  parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to  complete/utilize the requested Service or transaction, and the third  parties are not permitted to use your Personal Information except for  limited purpose of completing/providing the requested Service or  transaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may respond to subpoenas, court  orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Information and  other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish  or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may collect and possibly share  Personal Information and any other additional information available to  us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal  activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to  the physical safety of any person, violations of V-cube’s terms of  service, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While navigating V-cube’s web site or  Services you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted  by a third-party supplier. When information is collected on behalf of  V-cube exclusively, V-cube’s privacy policy will be referenced and will  govern how your information is used. For other, non-V-cube sites or  services, the site/service owner’s privacy policy will be referenced.  You should review such supplier’s privacy and security policies prior to  use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will ask for your consent before we  use or share your information for any purpose other than the reason you  provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order to let us  know your preferences, we will require an action on your part, such as  checking the appropriate option, to indicate your consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Security of your Personal Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V-cube is committed to protecting the  Personal Information you share with us. We utilize a combination of  industry-standard security technologies, procedures, and organizational  measures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized  access, use or disclosure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we transfer credit card information  over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)  encryption technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While we strive to protect your Personal  Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you  transmit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We recommend you to take every  precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the  Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of  letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a  secure browser.<br>
Cookies</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like many websites, V-cube uses  technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make  your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by  providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you  return.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A cookie cannot read personal data off  your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the  only Personal Information a cookie can contain is information you supply  yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access  to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to  personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns, and to  merge this info when you register. We do this in order to determine the  usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how  effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that  information. You may browse most of V-cube’s website without accepting  cookies from V-cube; however, some website functionality may be lost by  disabling cookies on your computer. Other V-cube web pages, particularly  those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be  used when you have disabled cookies in your browser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, V-cube uses web beacons in  conjunction with cookies to understand user behavior. Web beacons are  simply a convenient way of gathering basic statistics and managing  cookies, and do not give away any extra information from your computer.  Turning off your browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from  tracking your specific activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you prefer not to receive cookies  while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set  your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie  when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all  cookies by turning them off in your browser. You may browse most of the  V-cube website without accepting cookies; however, some website  functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other  V-cube web pages, particularly those which require a login and password,  require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in  your browser. For additional information about cookies and other  tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Linked websites and third party services</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our websites and services may provide  links to other third-party websites and services which are outside our  control and not covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the  privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites you visit or services  you use.<br>
Newsgroups/forums</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you participate in a V-cube  discussion forum or chat room, you should be aware that the information  you provide there will be made broadly available to others, potentially  inside or outside V-cube, who have access to that discussion forum or  chat room. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms  may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant’s opinion on a  forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as  reflecting the opinion of V-cube.<br>
Children’s privacy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V-cube does not knowingly collect  Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that  we have collected Personal Information on a child under the age of 13,  we will delete that data from our systems. V-cube encourages parents and  guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help  make a child’s online experience safer:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* Teach children never to give Personal  Information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless  supervised by a parent or responsible adult.<br>
* Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are  appropriate.<br>
* Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information  is treated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please visit the FTC’s website for more  tips on protecting children’s privacy online.<br>
Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Information</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may transfer your Personal  Information to the United States, to any V-cube or  subsidiary  worldwide, or to third parties acting on our behalf for the purposes of  processing or storage, and by providing any Personal Information you  fully understand and unambiguously consent to such transfer, processing  and storage of such information.<br>
Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents of the State of California,  under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to  request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all  third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information  during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively,  the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives  either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information  by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the  company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your  disclosure choice options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">V-cube qualifies for the alternative  option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with  details on how you may either Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your  Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the  third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing  purposes during the preceding year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a California resident and  request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure  choices you must send a request to customercare@vcube.com<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you have any privacy-related  questions or comments related to this privacy policy, please send an  email to privacy@V-cube.com.<br>
