</ul>
<p><strong>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</strong><br>
We may offer links to web sites operated by third parties.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other web sites.  We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any third party websites you choose to link to from the Sites so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.  We are not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Sites and the VCA family of websites.  This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Sites. <br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</strong><br>
The Sites use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience.  A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page.  For example, if you personalize any Site pages, or register with any Site or services provided through any Site, a cookie helps the Sites to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.  This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use features of the Sites that you have customized.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Sites or other websites you visit.</p>
<p>The Sites and e-mails we may send you may also use web beacons.  Web beacons are electronic images which can be used to deliver cookies, count visits or tell if an e-mail has been opened or acted upon.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>INTENDED FOR USERS OVER 13 YEARS OF AGE</strong><br>
The safety of children is very important to us.  Although the Sites are intended for use by persons at least 13 years of age, and we have processes in place to help prevent participation in our Site communities and use of our services by persons under </p>
<p>13 years of age at time of registration, we cannot prohibit minors from visiting the Sites and must rely on parents and guardians (at least 18 years of age at time of use) to decide which materials are appropriate for children under 13.  We will not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you become aware that a child under 13 years of age has registered for an online account with VCA or otherwise provided us with their personal information, please report such use to <a href="mailto:webmaster@vca.com">webmaster@vca.com</a>.  If we become aware of a user under the age of 13 providing information on our site without parental permission, we will terminate that account and purge our databases of all personal information provided by that user to the extent reasonably feasible.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
We secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure and secure the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and VCA, and other users and you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties or accidental loss or damage.  Therefore, your use of the Sites, the services made available through the Sites and your disclosure to us of any personally identifiable information is at your own risk.  However, once we receive a transmission from you, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure the security of your information in our operations.</p>
