			<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

			<ul>
			<li><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create a vChatter account, you provide some

			personal information, such as your name, password, birthdate, phone number, photo, and email
			address. Some information from your profile, for example, your name and photo, is listed publicly
			on vChatter, including on your profile page and in search results.</li>

			<li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with additional information to make public, such as a

			short biography, to help connect you with other users and groups on vChatter. If you do not want
			us to store metadata associated with Content you submit on vChatter, please remove the metadata
			before uploading the Content. You may customize your account with information such as a cell
			phone number for the delivery of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you
			find other users you know. We may use your contact information to send you information about
			our Services or to market to you. You may unsubscribe from these messages by following the
			instructions contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site.</li>

			<li><strong>Contacts Information:</strong> We offer contact importer tools to help you upload your contacts'

			addresses so that you can find followers on vChatter, and invite your contacts who do not have
			vChatter accounts to join. If you give us your password to retrieve those contacts, we will not store
			your password after you have uploaded your contacts' information.</li>

			<li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the

			Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring
			domain, pages visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with advertisements,
			may also be included in Log Data.</li>

			<li><strong>Links:</strong> vChatter may keep track of how you interact with links in messages across our Services

			including third party clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help
			improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics.</li>

			<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for a period of time on your computer,

			mobile phone, or other device) to make our Services easier to use, to improve advertising, and to
			protect both you and the vChatter community.</li>

			<li><strong>Third Party Services:</strong> We use a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide our

			Services and to help us understand how our users are using our Services. These other services may
			collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP
			request.</li>

			<li><strong>Information from other users:</strong> We may collect information about you from your interactions with

			other users.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
			<p>vChatter is about connecting you with other users and groups. This requires users to share a certain amount
			of information with other users. We promote this while also providing you with privacy controls that enable
			you to restrict other users from accessing some of your information. We share your information with third
			parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer the Services, or
			when legally required to do so. For example:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as when you
			use a third party web client to access your vChatter account.</li>
			<li> Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide
			  services to us. We may share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the
			  extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to
			  obligations mirroring the protections of this Privacy Policy.</li>
			<li> Law and Harm: We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary
  
			  to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address
			  fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property.</li>
			<li> Business Transfers: In the event that vChatter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
			  reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
			  The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</li>
			<li> Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated
			  or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public Tweets or the number of users who
			  clicked on a particular link.</li>
			</ul>
 
			 <h3>Defined Terms</h3>

			our use of your information and will always be at

			to this Privacy Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we may notify you via e-mail to the email
