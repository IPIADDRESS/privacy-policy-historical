<h3>Map Location Services</h3>
<p>On some map display requests there is an option, selectable by you, to use your current location for map centering. Location services are provided by your browser and typically there is an option available to you to enable or disable location services within the browser settings. Along with that option, usually the first time you display a location enabled map the browser will again ask for your permission to use your current location. Your current location is not used by vPike.com in any way other than to center the map.</p>

<h3>Web Server Activity</h3>
<p>Like most Web servers on the Internet, the vPike.com server collects and stores within Web access logs all of the information that your Web browser sends when it requests a Web page, including:</p>

<li>the date and time you accessed our site;</li>
<li>the Internet address of the Web page that you came from;</li>
<li>the page you requested from our site and the number of characters sent to your computer; and</li>
<li>the information your Web browser software sends as its so-called 'User Agent,' which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate the operating system used in your personal computer and the type of computer.</li>

<p>It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information. The logs are periodically summarized and analyzed to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness.</p>
