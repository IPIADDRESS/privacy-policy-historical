</p>

In Section 2(D) of this Privacy Policy, we provide a description of KeepSolid’s “no logging” policy that applies when you use the <b class="u_line">VPN Services</b>.
<br>
In Section 2(E) of this Privacy Policy, we provide additional categories of personal data that KeepSolid collects and how KeepSolid collects such personal data when you use <b class="u_line">KeepSolid Sign</b>.

<li id="keepsolid_sign">KEEPSOLID’S VPN SERVICES – NO LOGGING POLICY
<p>
<b>As explained in this Section 2(D), KeepSolid does NOT monitor, store, or log your internet activities (including the internet sites that you visit) while using any of our VPN Services</b>, except the total amount of internet traffic for each session and session dates (this data is collected only if you use personal servers or personal IP address). KeepSolid also stores the number of connected devices for each account – this data is monitored to enforce the maximum device limits. This data can be assessed in the <a href="/login" class="u_line">User Office</a>, where you may remove devices from your account.
 </p>
<p>
Certain personal data collected by us automatically (i.e. IP address, connection type, browser type and operating system) is stored only for the duration of your session in the VPN Services.

Therefore, it is impossible for KeepSolid to share, transfer, sell, rent, or disclose in any way to third parties your internet activities.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Services personal data: </b></p>
<p>KeepSolid does not sell or rent your personal data to any third parties without your consent. We will request and obtain your consent prior to selling or renting your personal data to any third parties. We do, however, need to share your personal data to run our everyday business.

<h2>5. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>You can limit your sharing and our use of your personal data when it is based on your consent. For example, you can control our use of cookies by using the settings of your internet browser. Please be aware that your limit on our use of personal data may cause our websites and applications to appear and function not as intended. You can also limit our use of your personal data for our marketing purposes. <a href="https://my.keepsolid.com/account/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to set your marketing preferences.</p>
<p><b>If the laws of some countries apply to you, you may have the right to do the following:</b></p>
<ol type="I">

<p>If the laws of some countries apply to you, you may have the “right to object” to our processing of your personal data when such processing is based on our, or a third party’s, legitimate interests. We will stop processing your personal data, unless:</p>
<ol type="I">

<h2>6. WHERE AND HOW WE STORE AND TRANSFER PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We use appropriate physical, electronic, technical, and organizational measures to secure and protect your personal data to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. You should understand, however, that no safeguards are guaranteed to prevent unauthorized disclosure and/or use of personal data. Because of that, we cannot guarantee or warrant that your personal data will never be exposed. We use third-party service providers globally to store and transfer personal data. We work with our third-party service providers to put in place adequate protections to ensure the security of personal data when it is stored and transferred.</p>
<h2>7. HOW LONG WE STORE PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We do not store certain personal data (i.e. IP address, connection type, browser type and operating system) that we collect automatically. See Section 2 (D) of this Privacy Policy for an explanation of our “no-logging” policy. We store some of your personal data that we collect from you and from other sources as long as you remain a user of the Services. We retain personal data necessary for compliance with our legal obligations and contractual performance for the longer of: (i) the required time period under applicable law; (ii) or seven years.</p>
<h2>8. COPPA</h2>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a United States federal law enacted to give parents increased control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used. The law applies to websites and services directed to, and which knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13. The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever to KeepSolid. If a child provides us with personal information, a parent or legal guardian of that child may contact us to obtain that information and/or delete it from our records by sending an email to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea9a98839c8b8993aa818f8f9a998586838ec4898587"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0373716a7562607a4368666673706c6f6a672d606c6e">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</p>
<h2>9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We may make changes to this Privacy Policy (and/or other applicable policies and Addenda) as the applicable laws, relevant technologies, and our data processing practices change. We will notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy (and/or other applicable policies and Addenda) by posting the updated policy on our website and in our applications and other Services. The changes to this Privacy Policy (and/or other applicable policies and Addenda) shall become effective upon such posting (as indicated by the date following “Last Updated:” at the top of this Privacy Policy and/or other applicable policies and Addenda), or as otherwise required by applicable law. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy (and other applicable policies and Addenda) on a periodic basis.</p>
