        <p>Children (persons under the age of 15 years) are not eligible to become a   vPOST member and use our services. We ask that children do not submit any   personal information to us.</p>
        <p><strong><a id="info_we" name="info_we"></a>2. Information We Collect</strong></p>
        <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with   a smooth, efficient, safer and customised trading experience. This allows us to   provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise   our services to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal   information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose and to achieve   this goal. </p>
        <p>To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online   registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact   information and other personal information. You are also required to provide us   with a User ID and Password. We use your financial information, including credit   card information to verify your name, address, and other contact information, as   well as to bill you for your use of our services. </p>
        <p>We automatically track certain information about you based upon your usage of   our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users'   demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and   our community. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis.   The information shall not contain anything that is personably identifiable about   you. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this   URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our   Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. </p>
        <p>You may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our   Site that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by   third parties. </p>
        <p>If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users   or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the   Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. </p>
        <p>If you register for vPOST on another web site or use a web site providing a   service for vPOST or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on vPOST,   that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions   back to vPOST. </p>
        <p><strong><a id="info_use" name="info_use"></a>3. Our Use of Your Information </strong></p>
        <p>We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the   information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain   from your current and past activities on the Site) to resolve disputes,   troubleshoot problems, help ensure safe trading on our Site, and enforce our   User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems   or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to   identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. </p>
        <p>You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our   marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse Site usage, to improve our content   and product offerings and customise our Site's content, layout, and services.   These uses improve our Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to   provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customised experience while   using our services. </p>
        <p>You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver   information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as   targeted banners, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications   relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy   Policy you expressly agree to receive this information. </p>
        <p><strong><a id="disclosure" name="disclosure"></a>4. Our Disclosure of Your   Information</strong></p>
        <p>Although vPOST uses industry standard practices to protect your personal   information, due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your   private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in   ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without   limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the   government or third parties under certain circumstances (further details of   which are set out below in the "Legal Requests" section), or third parties may   unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.   Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy,   we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal   information or private communications will always remain private. </p>
        <p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about   you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that   your personal information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the User   Agreement and Privacy Policy you expressly agree that your personal information   may be disclosed by vPOST in the following ways: </p>
        <p><a id="advertisers" name="advertisers"></a><strong>Advertisers.</strong> We   aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and   disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers   and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in   these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that   could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your   name, email address and password are never disclosed to advertisers. </p>
        <p><a id="community" name="community"></a><strong>vPOST Community.</strong> Throughout the Site, you are identified by your User ID. If you select your   email address as your User ID you will disclose your email address to other   users and third parties. As a result, other users and third parties might send   you unsolicited email and be able to personally identify all of your activities   on the Site. We describe how to change your User ID. Even if your User ID is not   your email address, your User ID can be used to identify you and your activities   throughout the Site. <a id="external_sps" name="external_sps"></a></p>
        <p><a id="other_corps" name="other_corps"></a><strong>Other Corporate   Entities</strong> . We share much of our data, including personal information   about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to   serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world, as   allowed by applicable law. To the extent that these entities have access to your   information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat   information they obtain from their members and users. Our subsidiaries and joint   ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our   practices described in this Privacy Policy, to the extent allowed by applicable   law. It is possible that vPOST, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any   combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity.   Should such a combination occur, you should expect that vPOST would share some   or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service.

To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their   own privacy customs and policies.
