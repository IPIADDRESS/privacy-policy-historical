<pre>Host Virtual respects your privacy. When using our sites, you may get<br>information, access online products and services, communicate with us or<br>link to other Web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you<br>may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or<br>services to you and to personalize your experience on our website. This<br>online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Individual<br>Identifying Information that you share with us. "Individual Identifying<br>Information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your<br>email address, name, title and mailing address.<br><br>This policy governs Web-sites owned and operated by Host Virtual. Our<br>policy does not govern Web-sites of other parties to which we may provide<br>links, because Host Virtual is not responsible, and can not control the<br>privacy practices or content of those sites. To demonstrate our commitment<br>to fair information practices, we have adopted leading communication<br>industry privacy guidelines.<br><br>We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully<br>participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs.<br>Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and<br>other privacy aspects of our Web sites:<br><br>    * Information Collection and Use<br>    * Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>    * Host Virtual Customer Account Maintenance &amp; Service Profile<br>    * Host Virtual Prospect Opt Out Profile<br>    * Security<br>    * Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>    * Questions or Suggestions<br>    * IP Information Collection and Use Practices<br>    * Cookies<br>    * Data Storage<br>    * Contact Us <br><br>Information Collection and Use<br><br>    * Host Virtual collects Individual Identifying Information when you<br>register for a Host Virtual account, or use certain Host Virtual products<br>or services, when you visit Host Virtual pages, and when you enter<br>promotions or sweepstakes. Host Virtual may also receive Individual<br>Identifying Information from our business partners.<br>    * When you register with Host Virtual, we ask for your name, email<br>address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal<br>interests, or other information. Once you register with Host Virtual and<br>sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.<br>    * Host Virtual also automatically receives and records information on<br>our server logs from your browser including your IP address , Host Virtual<br>cookie information and the page you requested.<br>    * Host Virtual uses information for three general purposes: to<br>customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for<br>certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new<br>products.<br>    * Host Virtual routinely time-stamps and logs events (like features<br>used, number of participants, length of meetings.) This data is used for<br>accounting/billing purposes as well as for performance tuning and<br>optimization of the Host Virtual services. <br><br>Information Sharing and Disclosure<br><br>    * Host Virtual will not sell or rent your Individual Identifying<br>Information to anyone.<br>    * Host Virtual will send Individual Identifying Information about you<br>to other companies or people when:<br>          o We have your consent to share the information;<br>          o We need to share your information to provide the product or<br>service you have requested;<br>          o We need to send the information to companies who work on<br>behalf of Host Virtual to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we<br>tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the<br>Individual Identifying Information we provide to them beyond what is<br>necessary to assist us.);<br>          o We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or<br>          o We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the Host<br>Virtual Terms of Service , or any of our usage guidelines for specific<br>products or services.<br><br>Host Virtual Customer Account Maintenance &amp; Service Profile<br><br>You have the ability to edit your Host Virtual Account Information,<br>including subscriptions for non-account specific email and general<br>promotions, at any time. To request account maintenance, contact Host<br>Virtual Customer Services at support@Host Virtual.com or call<br>+1-866-229-3239 or +1-408-435-7088.<br><br>Host Virtual Prospect Opt Out Profile<br><br>Host Virtual gives you the ability to edit your prospect profile and<br>preferences at any time, including whether you want Host Virtual to contact<br>you about special offers and new products. If you would prefer not to<br>receive messages from Host Virtual in the future, or if you just want to<br>update your profile, please indicate your preferences through the following<br>link. Host Virtual respects your privacy and will not sell or rent your<br>personal information.<br><br>Security<br><br>Host Virtual Meetings take place within the context of a switched<br>communications environment. With Host Virtual, any session information<br>(such as applications, chat, polling data, documents, video, and voice)<br>provided by participants within a meeting is never saved on the Host<br>Virtual switching platform but is instead instantly switched between<br>meeting participants. The Host Virtual switching environment is architected<br>similarly to the telephone switching environment; once the call is over all<br>remnants of the content of that call dissipate, leaving only a record that<br>a call took place. Further, the only means to participate in a meeting is<br>through the Host Virtual invitation and join process; Host Virtual<br>employees can therefore only participate in Host Virtual customer meetings<br>when expressly permitted by our customer.<br><br>    * Your Host Virtual Account Information is password-protected for your<br>privacy and security.<br>    * In certain areas Host Virtual uses industry-standard SSL-encryption<br>to protect data transmissions.<br>    * In other areas Host Virtual uses proprietary security methods to<br>protect data transmissions.<br><br>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br><br>If we change any of our privacy policies or practices, we'll post those<br>changes to this policy statement at least 30 days before they take effect.<br>In limited cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to<br>comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search<br>warrant.<br><br>Questions or Suggestions<br><br>If you have questions or suggestions complete a feedback form on our<br>contact us page.<br><br>IP Information Collection and Use Practices<br><br>    * Host Virtual receives IP addresses from all users because this<br>information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a<br>Web page.<br>    * Your IP address is also stored in our user registration databases<br>when you register with Host Virtual.<br>    * When a Host Virtual Web page is requested and viewed, that request<br>is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the<br>computer that requested the page.<br>    * IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to:<br>          o Diagnose service or technology problems reported by our users<br>or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a<br>specific Web company or ISP.<br>          o Send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area<br>or information derived from your IP address. Many IP addresses are commonly<br>associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major<br>corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information<br>derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers.<br>          o Estimate the total number of users visiting Host Virtual from<br>specific countries or regions of the world. <br><br>Cookies<br><br>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous<br>unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Web site's<br>computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each Web site can send<br>its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but<br>(to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access<br>the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by<br>other sites.<br><br>Choices about Cookies<br><br>    * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all<br>cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so<br>check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie<br>preferences.)<br>    * If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Host Virtual<br>products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be<br>able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many Host Virtual<br>products and services do not require that you accept cookies.<br><br>Host Virtual's Practices Regarding Cookies<br><br>Host Virtual uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:<br><br>    * Access your information when you "sign in," so that we can provide<br>you with customized content.<br>    * Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using Host<br>Virtual's services.<br>    * Display the most appropriate advertising banners, based on your<br>interests and activity on Host Virtual.<br>    * Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.<br>    * Conduct research to improve Host Virtual's content and services.<br>    * Require you to re-enter your Host Virtual password after a certain<br>period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally<br>accessing your account contents.<br><br>Data Storage<br><br>Account Information<br><br>    * When you register with Host Virtual or submit information to Host<br>Virtual, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent<br>accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human<br>error.<br>    * Host Virtual keeps your account information active in our user<br>registration databases in order to provide immediate access to your<br>personalization preferences each time you visit Host Virtual.<br>    * If you ask Host Virtual to delete your Host Virtual account, in most<br>cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from our user<br>registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary to<br>discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity.<br>    * Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in<br>back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This<br>may be the case even though no information about your account remains in<br>our active user databases.<br><br>Servers<br><br>    * The Host Virtual computers (called "servers") that send your Web<br>pages and advertising banners process and store an enormous amount of<br>information every day. These computer records are called "log files."<br>    * Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other<br>purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is<br>stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your Host<br>Virtual ID may remain in our active server log files.<br><br>Contact Us<br><br>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of<br>this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us.to</pre><!--TYPO3SEARCH_end--></div>
