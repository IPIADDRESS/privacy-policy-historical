							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<p>We are serious about protecting the privacy of our users, which comprise travelers (who
							 are seeking a property to rent) and members (who offer such properties on the Site). We
							 use information collected about you only as permitted in this Privacy Policy.. This is our
							 privacy policy, but please be aware that should you follow a link to another Web site, you
							 are no longer covered by this policy. It's a good idea to understand the privacy policy of
							 any Web site before sharing personal information with it.  Words and phrases used in this
							 policy have the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions of Use – available at <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/global/termsandconditions.htm">www.vrbo.com/global/termsandconditions.htm</a> (the “Terms and Conditions”).
							</p>
							<h3>Who processes your personal data ?</h3>
							<p>Your personal data (also referred to as personal information) – that is, data that identifies you, or from which you are identifiable – will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies and other data processors acting under contract with us.  Personal data contributed by or collected from users may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that you may be transferring your personal data outside of the country in which you have contributed it, and that you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country.  However, if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.</p>
    						<h3>The information we gather</h3>
							<p>At various times you may contribute your personal data to us.  For example, in order to
							process a request or enquiry you may make concerning a property or transaction, we need
							to know all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail
							address, and, in the case of a member’s (advertising) listing, a method of payment.  You
							may also contribute personal data to us at other times, such as when registering on the
							Site.</p>
							<p>For further detail on our gathering of personal data, see <b>Surveys</b> and <b>Newsletters</b> below.</p>

							<p></p>
							<h3>How we use your personal data</h3>
							<p>Your personal data will be used to provide and promote our Site, to process payments
							members make to us, to provide user support, and for other purposes referred to in this
							Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.</p>
                            <p>We will also use the personal data users provide to us to contact the user from time to
                            time with critical user or service updates, and to send other messages that are integral to
                            the service we provide on the Site.  If you have an account on the Site, we must always
                            be able to e-mail you operational information about your account and your use of our
                            services.</p>
                            <p>Your personal information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in the case of
                            special promotions by us, or one of our partners, about which you've requested to be
                            notified; 2) where a third party performs services on our behalf and has agreed to keep
                            such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the
                            conduct of an online survey for example); and 3) our Affiliates, but only for the purpose
                            of performing this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>In the event that we or the Site are acquired by a third party, your personal information
                            may be transferred to any such acquiror.</p>
							<h3>Newsletters</h3>
							<p>As a member of the Site, you will receive our “Owner”” newsletter, which is an integral
							part of the service we provide. Traveler users of the Site will be given the option to
							receive our “Traveler” newsletter when they registered with us.  Users may cancel their
							subscription to these newsletters at any time.
							</p>
							<h3>Surveys</h3>
							<p>Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our users. From time
							to time, we request users’ input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to
							answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.
							</p>
							<h3>Inquiries</h3>
							<p>Site users may send inquiries to members via clickable links on Site listings. If you
							choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your
							e-mail address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the member in
							question so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you may be
							asked to leave a return telephone number.  Do not share information in the e-mail or
							phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to,
							credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual
							member you selected and retained by us. The resulting inquiry is available for review
							only by the member to whom they were initially addressed and to our customer service
							employees, who may be asked by members for their past inquiry information. While the
							content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, the Site may, from time to
							time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry e-mails, and
							analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems; the
							resulting information is used and stored only in an anonymised form.
							</p>
                            <h3>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</h3>
                            <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to guard against unauthorised
                            or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of,
                            or damage to, your personal data. While no computer system is completely secure, we
                            believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems
                            to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to
                            protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it
                            remains each user's responsibility:</p>
                            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" start="a">
                            <li>to protect against unauthorised access to your use of the Site;</li>
                            <li>to ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user’s machine is "logged on" to the Site service;</li>
                            <li>to log off or exit from Site when not using it; and</li>
                            <li>where relevant, to keep his/her password or other access information secret.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store credit card numbers
                            or related identifying information on any Site server. All such information is stored by
                            our credit card processing partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its
                            proprietary methods.  Please remember that many services and transactions are performed
                            by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our security or common practices do not
                            apply to other companies.</p>

							<h3>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?
							</h3>
							<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser
							so that it can later be read back from that browser. We may use cookies to store
							some personal preferences for your future visits.  Cookies allow us to recognize you more
							quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site can be more personalized and productive.
							You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in
							much the same way we use them here at our Site.</p>
							<p>We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your Site visit or to conduct
							surveys. In the course of serving our pages, these third parties may place or recognize a unique
							"cookie" on your browser. These companies may use information (not including your name, address,
							e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site and other Web sites in order
							to help us understand how to serve you better.</p>
							<p>We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These
							companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number)
							about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
							services of interest to you.  When you view a web page on our Site that contains advertising
							provided by one of these third parties, the service provider may place a cookie on or retrieve
							a cookie from your computer if you have not disabled your browser from receiving cookies.</p>
							<p>If you wish, you can prevent cookie files from using (non-personal) information about you
							by either deleting the cookie folder in your browser or by putting your browser’s Privacy setting
							higher, but doing so will mean that (a) your use of the Site will be adversely affected (and quite
							possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to
							enhance or personalize your experience will be adversely affected, and (c) you will not be
							presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and other, sites.  You find
							out how to make these changes to your browser at this site:
							<a target="external" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>
							<h3>Web Beacons and Clear GIFs</h3>
							<p>We gather and share anonymised information concerning the usage of the Site by members and
							travelers with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.
							In this connection, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed in the
							web page code, called pixel tags (also called a “clear GIFs” or “Web Beacons”) that can serve many
							of the same purposes as cookies.</p>
							<p>Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to another in order
							to maximize web traffic flow.</p>
							<p>The Site's third-party advertising service providers may also use Web Beacons to recognize you
							when you visit the Site and to help determine how you found the Site.  If you would like more
							information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by
							these companies, click here: <a target="external" href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
							<h3>How we protect your privacy with third parties</h3>

							web beacons on our Site. These companies help operate our Site and provide you
							with additional products and services. They are subject to confidentiality
							agreements with us and other legal restrictions. We do not permit any of these
							companies to collect personal information using cookies or web beacons on our Site.</li>
							<li>Some of these companies — such as DoubleClick — are our service providers
							 who place cookies that help us serve our own content and compile anonymous
							 site metrics and analytics. We require these companies to use the information
							 they collect only to provide us with these services under contract.</li>
							<li>We participate in cookie-based ad networks operated by Exelate, Revenue
							Science and Tacoda. This means that these companies may use some anonymous
							information about you (based on a cookie on your computer) to display ads.
							We do not permit these companies to collect any personal information about you.
							Tacoda collects anonymous information using cookies to tailor the advertising
							you see on our Site or elsewhere on the web. Click these links to learn more

                            <p>We are a founding member of HomeAway Connect. Many of our subscribers have pre-existing
                            relationships with HomeAway Connect, which provides services to property owners including but
                            not limited to the universal calendar and guestbook</p>

                            calendars and guest books as they change from time to time.</p>
