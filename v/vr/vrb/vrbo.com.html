            HomeAway Privacy Policy&nbsp;</h1>
        <p>
        We are serious about protecting the privacy of our users.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy
        describes how we use and protect your personal data.&nbsp; It applies to HomeAway.com,
        VRBO.com, VacationRentals.com and any other websites where this policy is linked
        to in the footer of the page (which we have collectively called the “Site” in this
        policy).</p>
        <p>
        The Site is operated by HomeAway.com, Inc. which is part of the HomeAway, Inc. group
        (comprised of HomeAway, Inc.&nbsp; You can find details of the HomeAway group and
        the companies in it in its initial, annual and quarterly filings made with the United
        States Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms S-1, 10-K and 10-Q, which can
        be accessed here: <a href="http://investors.homeaway.com/sec.cfm" target="_blank">http://investors.homeaway.com/sec.cfm</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The terms “users” or “you” as used in this Privacy Policy, refer to both travelers,
        who use the Site to look for properties to rent, and members who join the Site and
        list their properties for rent.&nbsp; It also applies to other visitors to our site
        - for example our investors or those applying for a job through the site.
        </p>
        <p>
        We use information collected about you as explained in this Privacy Policy. The
        Site may contain links to third parties' websites. We're not responsible for the
        privacy practices or the content of those websites. Therefore, please read carefully
        any privacy policies on those websites before either agreeing to their terms or
        using those websites.&nbsp; Unless we explain otherwise in this policy, the words
        and phrases used in this policy have the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions
        of Use - available at <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/global/termsandconditions.htm" target="_blank">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>
        <p>
        By providing information to us when subscribing, contacting us or otherwise using
        the Site, you expressly agree to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy
        was last updated on November 7, 2011.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies from that
        date.&nbsp; We may occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect regulatory
        requirements, advances in technology, Site updates and changes in our information
        collection and disclosure practices. Any new policy will automatically be effective
        when it is published on the website. You should therefore return here regularly
        to view our most up to date Privacy Policy. You should also print a copy for your
        records.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Safe</strong><strong> Harbor</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        HomeAway complies with the US Department of Commerce’s Safe Harbor scheme to cover
        the transfer of data to the US from the European Union and Switzerland.&nbsp; HomeAway
        has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice,
        onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.&nbsp; To learn
        more about this scheme and see the information we have filed with the Department
        of Commerce here: <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Who processes your personal data, and where?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Your personal data (also referred to as personal information) - that is, data that
        identifies you, or from which you are identifiable - will be collected, processed,
        stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by companies in the HomeAway
        group and other data processors acting under our instructions. HomeAway is a global
        business.&nbsp; As a result personal data contributed by or collected from users
        may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we,
        members of the HomeAway group or our agents maintain facilities.&nbsp; By using
        our Site, you acknowledge and agree that you may be transferring your personal data
        outside of the country in which you have contributed it (“your country”), and that
        you consent to any transfer of information outside of your country. These countries
        may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country. However,
        if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in this way, we will take
        steps to try to ensure that your privacy rights are protected in compliance with
        applicable data protection law, this Privacy Policy, and the terms of our Safe Harbor
        self-certification.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>The information we gather</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        At various times you may give your personal data to us. For example, in order to
        process a request or inquiry from you, we may need to know all or some of the following:
        your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, your current location,
        and, in the case of a member's listing, a method of payment. You may also give personal
        data to us at other times, such as when registering on the Site or when submitting
        an advert for a property.&nbsp; We may also gather information from cookies or web
        beacons.&nbsp; You can find out more about they operate in the relevant section
        of this policy below.&nbsp; We also collect IP addresses, mobile device identifier
        details, your location, navigation and click-stream data, the time of accessing
        the website, homes you viewed, what you searched for, the duration of your visit,
        and other&nbsp; details of your activity on the Site. If you ask us to connect with
        other sites (for example if you ask us to connect with your Facebook account) we
        may get information that way too.&nbsp; For further details on how we collect personal
        data, see Surveys and Newsletters below.&nbsp; We obtain data from you either by
        you inputting your personal details, by the automatic collection of information
        about you as you use the Site, when we speak to you, or from third parties.&nbsp;
        Third party information may include credit information which we use to prevent and
        detect fraud, information from your mobile provider if you are accessing the Site
        over a mobile device or information from a third party such as a social media or
        travel opinions site where you have asked us to share your data with them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>How we use your personal data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the
        services you request and those which we believe will optimize your use of the Site.&nbsp;
        You agree that we may use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the services or to support your request;</li>
            <li>To contact you from time to time with user or service updates;</li>
            <li>To send other messages that help us provide our services on the Site;</li>
            <li>To assist people you have done business with.&nbsp; For example if you are an owner
                and a traveler who has booked or inquired with you needs your details we may pass
                them on; if you are a traveler and an owner you have booked with needs to contact
                you we may give them your details;</li>
            <li>To customize, measure, report on and improve our services, content and advertising;</li>
            <li>To promote services related to the Site or those of the HomeAway group and/or our
                affiliates;</li>
            <li>To compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties;</li>
            <li>To prevent, investigate or prosecute activity we think may be potentially illegal,
                unlawful or harmful and</li>
            <li>To enforce our Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein
                or therein.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        We collate statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information
        which we pass onto third parties to assist us in improving the services we provide
        to you. We also use demographic information to tailor the Site and we share that
        information with third parties so that they can build up a better picture of our
        customer base and general consumer trends.</p>
        <p>
        If you are a member, we will also be able to contact you about your account and
        your use of our services.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>How We May Disclose Your Personal Data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted
        to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law enforcement
        or governmental authority, or in connection with actual or proposed litigation,
        or to protect our property, people and other rights or interests.</p>
        <p>
        We may also share your personal data with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of our partners if you've requested their services or if you’ve requested to
                be provided with information by them;</li>
            <li>Another member if you have done business with them;</li>
            <li>A third party performing services on our behalf; </li>
            <li>Companies in the HomeAway group and/or affiliates; or </li>
            <li>Other companies or business entities, for example if we are thinking of a merger
                with or sale to that&nbsp; company or business entity; or</li>
            <li>Other companies we work with to feature all or part of our member's property listings
                or otherwise provide promotional or other services related to our or HomeAway group’s
                business.&nbsp; This might include featuring your listings and photographs on other
                websites; or</li>
            <li>Any third party you have asked us to share your personal data with – such as Facebook
                if you have asked us to connect with your Facebook account. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        You may have accessed our website through a hyperlink from the website of one of
        our trading partners.&nbsp; If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase
        information, including behavioral patterns, being shared with that trading partner
        in accordance with our contractual relationship with them.</p>
        <p>
        In the unlikely event that we or HomeAway, Inc. or any part of the HomeAway group
        is sold, or some of its assets transferred to a third party, your personal information,
        as a valuable asset, may also be transferred.&nbsp; Potential purchasers and their
        advisors may have access to data as part of the sale process. However, use of your
        personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Similarly, your
        personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the unlikely
        event of a liquidation, bankruptcy, or administration. Our customer database could
        be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole or in a number of parts.&nbsp;
        It could be that the purchaser's business is different from ours, too.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Newsletters</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you sign up as a member on the Site, you will receive our Owner newsletter, which
        is an integral part of the services we provide. Traveler users of the Site will
        be given the option to receive our Traveler newsletter when they register with us.
        We and HomeAway group may offer different newsletters from time to time intended
        to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may cancel their subscription to
        these newsletters at any time, although it may take a short while for the changes
        in your preferences to become effective.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Surveys</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        We also use surveys to collect information about our users. From time to time, we
        request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision
        to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys
        to improve our services.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Games</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        From time to time we may run games on the Site.&nbsp; These games may allow for
        connectivity with other users or third parties.&nbsp; If that is the case you consent
        to your personal data being transferred accordingly.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Telephone Calls</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        As well as collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with
        you face to face (for example at an Owner’s meeting) or by&nbsp; telephone.&nbsp;
        We frequently record telephone conversations.&nbsp; Those recordings are also governed
        by this Privacy Policy and we keep this data in the same way that we keep other
        data.&nbsp; Recordings of calls may also be transferred to locations or processed
        worldwide.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Inquiries</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Travelers may send inquiries to members via clickable links on the listings on the
        Site. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information,
        including your email address and any other information you supply, will be visible
        to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you.&nbsp; Your details
        may also be sent to us and we may have access to those communications even if you
        contact the member directly.&nbsp; Additionally those messages may be hosted on,
        be processed by or transmit through our servers.&nbsp; If you call the member, you
        may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the
        e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them and HomeAway group
        to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information.
        Inquiries can be sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. The
        resulting inquiry is available for review by the member to whom it was initially
        addressed and to our customer service people, who may share past inquiry information,
        or information related to past stays including your contact details with members.
        We may also from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track
        receipt of inquiry emails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by
        these third party tracking systems.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized
        or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction
        of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe
        the measures implemented by the Site reduce our vulnerability to security problems
        to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in
        place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally.
        However, it remains your responsibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site; </li>
            <li>To ensure no-one else uses the Site while your machine is logged on to the Site
                (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access
                connection you are using); </li>
            <li>To log off or exit from the Site when not using it; </li>
            <li>Where relevant, to keep your password or other access information secret.&nbsp;
                Your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to
                anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network; and
            </li>
            <li>To maintain good internet security.&nbsp; For example if your email account or Facebook
                account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have
                given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email
                account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access
                to your account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure.&nbsp;
                If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your
                account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account
                does not allow access to your account with us.&nbsp; You should also tell us as
                soon as you can, so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if
                necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.<br>
                If you have asked us to share data with third party sites, however (such as Facebook)
                their servers may not be secure. Credit card information is generally stored by
                our credit card processing partners and we ask them to keep that data secure.&nbsp;
                We also use third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising
                (see below).&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the
        internet is not secure.&nbsp; As a result others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept
        or access private transmissions or data.

        <strong>What are Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web
        pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to
        help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising,
        measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly
        used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here
        at our Site.</p>
        <p>
        You may delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will
        not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.
        Even if you are only browsing the Site certain information (including computer and
        connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform
        details, and the time of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you.
        This information will be collected every time you access the Site and it will be
        used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>
        You can reduce the information cookies collect from your device.&nbsp; An easy way
        of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you
        should know that (a) your use of the Site may be adversely affected (and possibly
        entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies
        to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you
        may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and
        other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site:
        <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.&nbsp;
        Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our
        system will send cookies as soon as you visit our site.&nbsp; By using the site
        you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        We gather and share information concerning the use of the Site by members and travelers
        with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.
        To do this, some of the pages you visit on our Site use electronic images placed
        in the web page code, called pixel tags (also called "clear GIFs" or "web
        beacons") that can serve many of the same purposes as cookies.</p>
        <p>
        Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one page to
        another in order to maximize web traffic flow. Our third-party advertising service
        providers may also use web beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site and
        to help determine how you found the Site. If you would like more information about
        this and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
        click here: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.

        <strong>Phishing or False emails</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our members
        that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password),
        or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information
        by clicking on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying
        to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher"
        or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an email.
        Do not provide the information or click on the link.&nbsp; Please contact us at
        <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/support/" target="_blank">Customer Support</a> if you
        get an email like this.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Job applicants, current and former employees</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you use the Site to apply to work with us, we will use the information you supply
        to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics.&nbsp; Where we
        want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take
        up a reference, will not do so without informing you beforehand unless the disclosure
        is required by law.&nbsp; Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will
        be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will
        then be destroyed or deleted.&nbsp; We retain de-personalized statistical information
        about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but individuals should
        not be identifiable from that data. HomeAway is based in the US and employee and
        recruitment data is held there and in other HomeAway Group locations worldwide.</p>
        <p>
        Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to
        their employment.&nbsp; At that stage we will give you more details about how we
        hold employee details.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>How do I correct or update my information?</strong>
        </p>

        this if you are an Owner is to log on to your account by using the ‘Owner Login’
        tab at the top of the screen.&nbsp; You can see your basic details and correct or
        update them there at any time to suit you.&nbsp; We also want to give you the opportunity
        to identify any inaccuracies in any other information we hold about you. Where possible,
        if we're told about the inaccuracy of any personal information, we will make appropriate
        corrections. You can ask to see, update or amend any information we hold on you
        by contacting us.
