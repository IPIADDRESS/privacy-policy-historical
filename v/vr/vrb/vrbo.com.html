							<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<p>VRBO.com is serious about protecting the privacy of our members and our 
								renting visitors. We use information collected about you only to process and 
								bill orders and to make our Website a more useful and valuable service. We 
								respect the privacy of those who visit or become members. Our privacy policy is 
								stated below, but please be aware that should you follow a link on our website 
								to another website, you are no longer covered by this policy. It’s a good idea 
								to understand the privacy policy of any website before sharing personal 
								information with it.
							</p>
							<h2>Your Information: What, How, and Why?
							</h2>
							<h3>Property Owners/Advertisers and Vacation Planning Visitors</h3>
							<p>In order to process a request you may have of us we need to know contact 
								information that could include all or some of the following: your full name, 
								address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of an advertising 
								listing, a method of payment. VRBO.com will use this information to contact you 
								from time to time with critical customer updates and information, or to send 
								you information about new services or opportunities. You will be able to “opt 
								out” and not receive marketing information, but we must always be able to email 
								you critical information about your account and our mutual business 
								relationship. Your information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in 
								the case of special promotions by VRBO.com, or one of its partners, about which 
								you've requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs services on 
								behalf of VRBO.com and has agreed to keep such information confidential (such 
								as the processing of your credit card payment or the conduct of an online 
								survey for example); and 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple 
								VRBO.com advertisers and visitors where individual personal information is not 
								disclosed. VRBO.com shares Website usage information about advertisers and 
								visitors with a third-party tracking company for the purpose of reporting 
								statistics. For this purpose, some of the pages you visit on our Website use 
								pixel tags (also called clear gifs). VRBO.com also uses your information to 
								market its services and to gain feedback on potential new services.
							</p>
							<h3>Newsletters</h3>
							<p>As an advertiser or visitor to VRBO.com, you will receive either or both of our 
								Member or Traveler newsletters. You may cancel your subscription to these 
								newsletters at any time.
							</p>
							<h3>Surveys
							</h3>
							<p>Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our visitors. 
								From time to time, we request member’s or newsletter subscribers' input in 
								order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a 
								survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve 
								our service.
							</p>
							<h3>Inquiries
							</h3>
							<p>Site visitors may send inquiries to our members via clickable links on VRBO.com 
								listings. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal 
								information, including your email address and any other information you supply, 
								will be visible to the owner of the property you inquired about so that they 
								might reply directly to you. Do not share information in the email that you are 
								not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card 
								and bank account information. These inquiries are both sent to the member you 
								selected and retained by VRBO.com. The resulting inquiry is available for 
								review only by the owner/advertiser to whom they were initially addressed and 
								to VRBO.com customer service employees, who may be asked by advertisers for 
								their past inquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not 
								shared with any other party, VRBO.com may, from time to time, use third party 
								email servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry emails, and analyze the 
								pattern of inquiry usage via these third party tracking systems. All inquiries 
								sent through VRBO.com are accepted and are governed by our Terms and Conditions 
								of Service and our Privacy Policy.
							</p>
							<h3>How Do We Protect Your Information Once We Have It?
							</h3>
							<p>All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store credit 
								card numbers or identifying information on any VRBO.com server. All such 
								information is stored by Verisign, our credit card processing partner, on their 
								secured servers, and is protected via its proprietary methods. <a target="external" href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside">Click here to 
								read the Verisign privacy policy</a>. Please remember that many services and 
								transactions are performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy and our 
								security or common practices do not apply to other companies.
							</p>
							<h3>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?
							</h3>
							<p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a 
								Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. VRBO.com may 
								use cookies to store some personal preferences for your future visits. Cookies 
								allow us to recognize you more quickly; therefore, your time spent on our site 
								can be more personalized and productive. You'll find that cookies are an 
								industry standard and are used at most major Websites in much the same way we 
								use them here at VRBO.com. We use third-party site usage tracking companies to 
								analyze your Website visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of serving our 
								pages, these third parties may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your 
								browser. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, 
								e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to VRBO.com and other 
								Websites in order to help us understand how to serve you better. By using our 
								Website and signing up for VRBO.com services, you consent to the collection and 
								use of the previously mentioned information by VRBO.com and our affiliates. 
								This policy is subject to change without notice. Privacy issues represent a 
								growing concern for all Web users. To keep up-to-date with our policies, please 
								check this page frequently. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or 
								remove portions of this policy at any time.
							</p>
							<h3>What information do we share with Rentors.org?</h3>
							<p>&nbsp;VRBO.com is a founding member of Rentors.org. Many of our subscribers have 
								pre-existing relationships with Rentors.org, which provides services to 
								property owners including but not limited to the universal calendar and 
								guestbook. If you wish to use our calendar, you must be a member of 
								Rentors.org. In order to make this easy for you, we share information, such as 
								your name and your property ID with Rentors.org so that updates you make to 
								your calendar while on VRBO.com will update the calendar you have on 
								Rentors.org or on the other websites where you have posted your Rentors.org 
								calendar. You do not need to register with Rentors.org, because we pass only 
								the information Rentors.org requires through to them so that they can properly 
								update calendars and guest books as they change from time to time.

							</p>
							<h3>What information do we share with iTravex.com?
							</h3>
							<p>VRBO.com is a partner of Owner Direct Vacation Home Exchange, publisher of 
								<a target="external" href="http://www.itravex.com">www.iTravex.com</a>. (“iTravex”) When a member requests to join iTravex, VRBO.com 
								will send certain information, including your name, email address, and property 
								information to iTravex servers in Canada. In addition, any changes a member 
								makes to their listing on VRBO.com will be automatically sent to iTravex. If 
								you wish to opt out of iTravex in the future, VRBO.com will stop sending 
								automatic updates. Even so, as a member of iTravex, you will be subject to the 
								iTravex Privacy Policy, which we encourage you to read and understand prior to 
								joining iTravex.
