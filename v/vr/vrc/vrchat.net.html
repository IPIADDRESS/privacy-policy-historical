You may provide us with information in various ways on the Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account (we will collect your email address, birthday, and allow you to create a username and password), subscribe to our newsletters, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests.

We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.  We may use third party cookies on our Service as well.  For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data.  To learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information and what choices you have, please visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank&quot;">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. VRChat does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.

We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.

This may occur when you engage in conversations, chats, or other user-to-user interactions.  We may collect and use this information to the extent permitted by law.

Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by VRChat. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies. Please note that privacy choices you have made on VRChat will not carry over to third party sites or services (and vice-versa).
