<p><strong>Effective date: May 23, 2018</strong></p>

<p>Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (including its affiliate entities, collectively, “Varian”) is committed to respecting your privacy. As you visit our website, our intent is that your experience is informative, convenient and secure. Varian has adopted the following privacy statement to explain our commitment to your privacy and how we responsibly manage the personal data provided by you.</p>


<p>This privacy statement applies to our&nbsp;<a href="/">varian.com</a>&nbsp;domain and other Varian websites, applications and service platforms (including those offered through MyVarian) that link to this privacy statement. This privacy statement discloses Varian's practices with respect to the type of information that we gather, the way we use information internally and our policy regarding sharing information with others. This privacy statement also describes how you can manage your personal information. </p>


<p>We encourage you to read this privacy statement carefully in order to ensure that you are in control of your personal information received by our company.</p>


<h5>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>


<p>When you visit our website, we may ask you to provide certain personal information, which means any information that is related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual, including: first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address or phone number. We may also ask you to provide other personal information such as title, occupation, industry, or personal interests that is necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have requested.
</p>

<p>
If you chose to make a purchase or sign-up for an on-line service, we may collect additional information such as your credit card information, billing address, and other billing account information.

If you have signed-up to receive newsletters or other marketing material, we may collect your first and last name, title, physical address and other personal information necessary to enhance your visit to Varian's website or request information regarding our products or services.
</p>

<p>
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. 
</p>

<h5>PURPOSES OF USING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>

<p>
Varian may use and otherwise process personal information for a number of reasons.  Unless otherwise stated or apparent for the context, Varian’s legal basis to do so under applicable law (including European and other worldwide privacy laws) is that such processing is necessary in Varian’s or a relevant third party’s legitimate interests.  Such legitimate interests include those listed below and those set out elsewhere in this privacy statement:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul><li>Providing you with certain products, services and information you request, including marketing and promotional related information; </li>
<li>Maintaining or administering services, performing business analyses, or for other internal purposes to improve the quality of our business, products and services we offer; and</li>
<li>Publishing stories, comments, photos, and other information posted in our interactive and story sharing features.</li>
</ul><p>
We may also process your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, to perform a contract between us and you, or to establish and defend any legal claims. In some cases, our basis for processing will be because you have consented to our use of your information.  You have the right to withhold or withdraw such consents at any time. If the means for doing so are not apparent from the context, please contact us at <a href="mailto:marcom@varian.com">marcom@varian.com</a>. </p>

<p>
By using our website, you accept and consent to the practices described in this privacy statement. Where the foregoing consent does not apply or is not applicable under local law, then Varian will rely on its other legal basis described in this privacy statement.
</p>



<h5>DOMAIN NAME AND IP ADDRESS</h5>

<p>We collect the domain names and IP addresses of our visitors for statistical purposes, in order to measure use of our website, to improve the content or responsiveness of our site or to customize the content or layout of the site for the individual visitor. We may also aggregate information relating to our visitors' traffic patterns from the data that we collect and retain concerning the IP addresses and domain names of our visitors, and we may divulge such aggregate information about our users with third parties such as our business partners, distributors, and service and support providers.
</p>
<p>
We do not link aggregate user data with personal information. You may visit our website anonymously if you wish, by using appropriate software or web services available from or through third parties.

Access to this data is restricted to those providers and those who administer our network and public website. </p>




<h5>E-MAIL ADDRESS</h5>

<p>You should know that e-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail.
</p>

<p>
We collect e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, from e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor participation in surveys and site registrations.

Varian and these companies have entered into an agreement whereby the information supplied by and about Varian's visitors cannot be shared with outside companies by the outside vendor without Varian’s authorization and such visitor information cannot be used for any purposes other than to perform a service or supply materials requested by the visitor.
</p>

In certain situations, Varian may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Varian's Legal Department may access and use your personal information and other information or data to protect our rights, in the event of a dispute or in response to legal process, law enforcement inquiries or abuse of our website.
