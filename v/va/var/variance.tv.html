                    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p id="infoDate">Last updated: <span id="date">August 3, 2015</span></p>
                    <p>We're always working to make our services even better. One of the ways we do that is by analyzing information we collect and receive about users in order to figure out what they might be interested in. This helps us develop more engaging content and provide more effective advertising, which enables us to keep most of our services free.</p>

                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy describes how we handle the information we collect and receive about users. There are three things you should keep in mind as you read it:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, the Privacy Policy applies to Variance TV services that link to or refer to this Privacy Policy. These services include websites, mobile apps, other online services and anything else that links to or refers to this policy. To keep things simple, we refer to all these services as our "Services."</li>
                        <li>Second, the Privacy Policy applies no matter what computer or device you use to access our Services.</li>
                        <li>Third, we may provide additional information about the privacy practices of some of our Services. Although this Privacy Policy applies to all Variance TV services that refer or link to it, you should read the additional information, too. Some of this information is linked from various places in the Privacy Policy, and some is available through the individual Services that you use. We've done our best to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple, but if you have any questions about it, we hope you'll let us know.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Information We Collect and Receive</h3>
                    <p>We collect and receive information about users in a few different ways:</p>
                    <p><span id="strong">-Information you give us.</span> You can give us information directly. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you post comments in response to a story or video on any of our Services, we-and other users-receive that information.</li>
                        <li>When you otherwise contact us or provide us information directly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span id="strong">-Information we collect or receive when you use our Services.</span> We also collect or receive information when you use our Services. We collect some of this information using cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Depending on how you access and use our Services, we may receive:</p>

                    <p id="other">Log information. This is information we automatically collect and store when you use our Services or other companies' websites and apps in the Variance TV Advertising Network. It may include, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information about your interactions with the websites, apps, and other services you use, the content you view, the search queries you submit, and information in cookies and similar technologies.</li>
                        <li>Information about how you access those websites, apps, and other services, your browser or operating system, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and the website you visited before visiting our Services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="other">Device information. This is information we automatically collect and store about the device you use when you access our Services or the services in the Variance TV Advertising Network. (Note that by "device," we mean anything you use to access our Services. Device information includes, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The type of device you're using (e.g., an iPhone).</li>
                        <li>Certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device.</li>
                        <li>Your Internet service provider.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="other">Location information. This information can include, for example, your device's GPS signal and information about nearby WiFi networks and cell towers. We get this information when you use location-enabled services like MapQuest, which can give you driving directions based on your current location.</p>
                    <p><span id="strong">-Information from third-party sources.</span>We may receive additional information about you that is publicly or commercially available and combine that with the information we have collected or received about you in other ways. Also, we receive information about you when you choose to connect with social networking services while using our Services. Learn more about how that works here.</p>

                    <p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. Such third parties include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advertising providers, which help us and our advertising customers provide ads that are tailored to users' interests and understand how users respond to those ads</li>
                        <li>Audience-measurement companies, which help us measure the overall usage of our Services and compare that usage to other online services and</li>
                        <li>Social networking services (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google ) that enable you to login to certain of our Services and to share things you find on our Services with your social network.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services.</p>
                    <p>Note that some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted ads. To learn more, please visit the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to connect with a social networking service, such as Facebook, we may share information with that service, and that service may share information about you with us. We may use the information for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy, but the main reason we use it is to make your experience on our Services more personal and social. For example, we might show you what content is popular among your connections on the social networking service or give you a glimpse of what your friends are saying about that content.</p>
                    <p>It's important to remember that we don't control the privacy practices of these (or any other) third-party services. So we encourage you to read the privacy policies of the services before connecting to them.</p>

                    <h3>"Do Not Track" Signals</h3>
                    <p>Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Variance TV currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.</p>

                        <li>Using HTTPS encryption when you authenticate (i.e., log into one of our Services), which helps prevent unauthorized access to your login credentials</li>
                        <li>Limiting access to personal information to employees who need that access to perform their job and</li>
                        <li>Providing company-wide training on privacy and data security.</li>
