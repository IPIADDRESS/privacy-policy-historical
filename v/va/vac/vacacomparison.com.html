    	<h1 align="center">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Our goal is to make VacaComparison.com the most  trusted site in online travel. To do this, we need your help, so any  suggestions for improvement can be sent to us directly via email at <a href="mailto:Info@VacaComparison.com">Info@VacaComparison.com</a>.</p>
      <p><br>
        VacaComparison.com is a search engine that saves  you time and money. We search the web for the best fares and rates; and then you  go directly to a travel supplier's website to make your purchase. So, this  means we do not take your credit card information and we do not take your hard  earned money. Registration on VacaComparison.com is strictly voluntary. You do  get some cool information and access to certain great features if you do  register, but membership is not necessary to get our great rates and fares.<br>
          </p>
      <p><strong>What's Your Sign?</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com collects personally  identifiable information (“PII”) that you provide to us. This includes (at your  discretion) your name, email address, password and certain parts of the travel  information you submit when you choose to use the VacaComparison.com Trips  service (the “Trips Service”). Our software uses the PII to personalize and  manage the VacaComparison.com website for you. For example, our site stores your  favorite airport and airlines. Also, the Trips Service software uses PII to  create and maintain your travel itineraries. If you do decide to give us this  information, you are telling us that this information is both true and  accurate. Also, you are telling us that you have the authorization to provide  us with that information.<br>
        In order to make our site more efficient, we may  also collect certain non PII information (such as destination or site usage  behavior) based on your use of VacaComparison.com. We may use this information  to display advertising that you find interesting and suppress advertising that  you might find boring or annoying. For example, we might show you travel offers  from your home airport, but not those from airports that are other places in  the country. Also, we may use this information to send you target email  marketing messages that you might find interesting.<br>
        To help us debug problems with our software  (rare as they are), we may collect some technical information from your browser  software (such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer), screen resolution and  the website that referred you to us.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>We'll Keep You In The  Loop</strong><br>
        <br>
        When you choose to register with us,  VacaComparison.com logs you in automatically using your email address. This  makes it easier for you as you don't have to create and remember a login  identifier. The use of your email address for login also allows  VacaComparison.com the chance to email you a new password in case you forget or  lose your old one. This is perfectly OK and happens to the best of us,  particularly those of us that are incredibly busy. If you do register with us,  VacaComparison.com will save your information and recognize you regardless of  where you login from. So if you are visiting friends and using their computer,  we'll know it's you and display your searches and preferences when you do  login.<br>
        VacaComparison.com gives you the option of  receiving emails from us. We think they are quite amusing, but you may not and  can opt out any time. Our emails are sent from a VacaComparison.com address and  are sent to your real email address. If you are a registered user and send  email booking confirmations to our Trips Service, we will recognize you. If  you’ve never registered on VacaComparison.com and you send us email booking  confirmations, we’ll send you an email asking you to register. We’ll also send  you an email if you send us your email booking confirmations but we are unable  to recognize the travel provider or otherwise to create your consolidated  itinerary. Every email that we send has an opt-out URL, so you can be  unsubscribed when you want. We do hate spam at VacaComparison.com and suspect  that you do too.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>In This Case Sharing Is  Not Caring</strong><br>
        <br>
        What's yours is yours. The PII that you chose to  share with us is not going anywhere off of our site. We won't sell your PII to  anyone. There might be an exception in the event VacaComparison.com itself is  sold. In this case we would transfer your PII to our buyers so that they could  continue to provide the same great VacaComparison.com service. Also, if you use  the Trips Service, you can send, or grant access to, your itinerary to your  friends and family. Once displayed on publicly-viewable web pages, that  information can be collected and used by others.<br>
        From time to time, we will also share aggregated  usage information with others. This type of information does not contain your  identity or anything personally identifiable to you.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>If The Police Come  Knocking At Our Door</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com may disclose to authorized law  enforcement personnel the personal data from anyone who poses a threat to our  interests. This might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or  those who conduct activities that could bring harm to others. We assume that  this is not you so please don't worry.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>You Are The Boss</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com members and site visitors have  control over the use of their personal data. Since you are the boss on  VacaComparison.com, you always can change your account settings in the "My  Profile" page on VacaComparison.com. How does it feel to be such a big  shot?<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Protecting Your  Information</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com has a sophisticated security  program intended to keep the information stored in our systems protected from  unauthorized access. We store your information in secure data centers located  in the United States. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or  scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to the highest industry standards.  We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you  send over the Internet. Third party security firms review our internal security  policies and documentation regularly. The bottom line is, when it comes to  information security, we mean business.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies (Not The Kind  You Eat With Milk)</strong><br>
        <br>
        When you visit VacaComparison.com we may store  information about your web session and assign you one or more 'cookies'. Your  browser will store these cookies on you computer in a small text file. For  example, when you decide to login as a VacaComparison.com member, we store  encrypted information in your browser so you don't have to login on every page.<br>
        Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's  hard drive until you delete them manually using your browser or operating  system software. You can enable your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so  may disable access to some services and tools that we offer.<br>
        VacaComparison.com does make money by selling  advertising as well as referrals from searches on our site. Our third party  advertising partners often use a cookie or third party web beacon (a single  pixel GIF image) to track when a click becomes a sale (cha ching). No PII is  ever sent to these advertising partners.<br>
        We use third-party advertising companies to  serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not  including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your  visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about  goods and services of interest to you. <br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Can We Email You  Sometime?</strong><br>
        <br>
        With the exception of emails confirming  registration, emails that include information about your account, emails  relating directly to an itinerary or travel profiles created through the Trips  Service, and service announcements and administrative messages that are  considered part of your account membership, we will not send you any emails  unless you opt-in to receive communications from us. If you opt-in to receive  communications from us, you will receive information we believe will be of use  and interest to you, including target email marketing messages. If you decide  that you are no longer interested in receiving email communications from us,  you may follow the instructions in our emails to unsubscribe from our email  list.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Every Website Has Its  Own Voice and Policies</strong><br>
        <br>
        Although we work with responsible third parties,  their business policies may include different privacy policies and practices  than we have. So when you click through to third party websites, our privacy  policies no longer apply. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of  these partner websites.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Big Kids Only Please</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com does not knowingly collect PII  information from people under the age of 18. If we become aware of the fact  that a minor is attempting to submit this information, we will inform the minor  that he or she is ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information  from our records.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Should We Evolve,  Change, Self Actualize</strong><br>
        <br>
        VacaComparison.com reserves the right to modify  this privacy statement at any time. If there are material changes to this  statement on how VacaComparison.com will use your PII, we will prominently post  these changes prior to implementing them. If you use our website after we post  these changes, this indicates your acceptance of them. Regardless of later  updates, we will follow the privacy practices described in this privacy  statement at the time you provided us with your information. If you have  questions about our privacy policies, please email us at <a href="mailto:Info@VacaComparison.com">Info@VacaComparison.com</a>.</p>
