    <tr>

      <td>
      <p>We are serious about protecting the privacy of our
users, which comprise travelers (who are seeking a property to rent)
and members (who offer such properties on the Site). We use information
collected about you only as permitted in this Privacy Policy. This is
our privacy policy, but please be aware that should you follow a link
to another Web site, you are no longer covered by this policy. It's a
good idea to understand the privacy policy of any Web site before
sharing personal information with it. Words and phrases used in this
policy have the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions of Use -
available at www.vacationrentals.com (the "Terms and Conditions").</p>

      <h4><strong>Who processes your personal data?</strong></h4>

      <p>Your personal data (also referred to as personal
information) - that is, data that identifies you, or from which you are
identifiable - will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and
passed to and processed by our subsidiary and/or affiliated companies
and other data processors acting under contract with us. Personal data
contributed by or collected from users may be stored and processed in
the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates,
subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using our Site, you
acknowledge and agree that you may be transferring your personal data
outside of the country in which you have contributed it, and that you
consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that
apply in your country. However, if we transfer your personal data
outside of your country in this way, we will take steps to ensure that
your privacy rights continue to be protected in compliance with
applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h4>The information we gather</h4>

      <p>At various times you may contribute your personal data
to us. For example, in order to process a request or enquiry you may
make concerning a property or transaction, we need to know all or some
of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, and, in the case of a member's (advertising) listing, a method
of payment. You may also contribute personal data to us at other times,
such as when registering on the Site. <br>

      <br>

For further detail on our gathering of personal data, see <strong>Surveys</strong>
and <strong>Newsletters</strong> below.</p>

      <h4><strong>How we use your personal data</strong></h4>

      <p>Your personal data will be used to provide and promote
our Site, to process payments members make to us, to provide user
support, and for other purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy and
the Terms and Conditions. <br>

      <br>

We will also use the personal data users provide to us to contact the
user from time to time with critical user or service updates, and to
send other messages that are integral to the service we provide on the
Site. If you have an account on the Site, we must always be able to
e-mail you operational information about your account and your use of
our services. <br>

      <br>

Your personal information is not shared with third parties, except: 1)
in the case of special promotions by us, or one of our partners, about
which you've requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs
services on our behalf and has agreed to keep such information
confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the
conduct of an online survey for example); and 3) our Affiliates, but
only for the purpose of performing this Agreement. <br>

      <br>

In the event that we or the Site are acquired by a third party, your
personal information may be transferred to any such acquiror.</p>

      <h4><strong>Newsletters</strong></h4>

      <p>As a member of the Site, you will receive our "Owner""
newsletter, which is an integral part of the service we provide.
Traveler users of the Site will be given the option to receive our
"Traveler" newsletter when they registered with us. Users may cancel
their subscription to these newsletters at any time.</p>

      <h4><strong>Surveys</strong></h4>

      <p>Surveys are another method by which we gather
information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input
in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to
answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from
surveys to improve our service.</p>

      <h4><strong>Inquiries</strong></h4>

      <p>Site users may send inquiries to members via clickable
links on Site listings. If you choose to send an inquiry through these
links, your personal information, including your e-mail address and any
other information you supply, will be visible to the member in question
so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you
may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share
information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to
allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank
account information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual
member you selected and retained by us. The resulting inquiry is
available for review only by the member to whom they were initially
addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by
members for their past inquiry information. While the content of these
inquiries is not shared with any other party, the Site may, from time
to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of
the inquiry e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported
by these third party tracking systems; [the resulting information is
used and stored only in an anonymised form.</p>

      <h4><strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal
Information Once We Have It?</strong></h4>

      <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational
measures to guard against unauthorised or unlawful processing of your
personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage
to, your personal data. While no computer system is completely secure,
we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood
of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data
involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user
database and access to this database is restricted internally. However,
it remains each user's responsibility: </p>

      <ol>

        <li>to protect against unauthorised access to your use of
the Site; </li>

        <li>to ensure no-one else uses the Site while the user's
machine is "logged on" to the Site service; </li>

        <li>to log off or exit from Site when not using it; and </li>

        <li>where relevant, to keep his/her password or other
access information secret. </li>

      </ol>

All personal information is stored on a secure server. We do not store
credit card numbers or related identifying information on any Site
server. All such information is stored by our credit card processing
partner, on their secured servers, and is protected via its proprietary
methods. <strong>Please remember that many services and
transactions are performed by our business partners. Our privacy policy
and our security or common practices do not apply to other companies.</strong>
      <h4><strong>What is a Cookie and Why Do We Use Them?</strong></h4>

      <p>A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web
server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from
that browser. We may use cookies to store some personal preferences for
your future visits. Cookies allow us to recognize you more quickly;
therefore, your time spent on our site can be more personalized and
productive. You'll find that cookies are an industry standard and are
used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here at
our Site. <br>

      <br>

We use third-party site usage tracking companies to analyze your Site
visit or to conduct surveys. In the course of serving our pages, these
third parties may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
These companies may use information (not including your name, address,
e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site and
other Web sites in order to help us understand how to serve you better.
      <br>

      <br>

We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit our Site. These companies may use information (not including your
name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to
this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods
and services of interest to you. When you view a web page on our Site
that contains advertising provided by one of these third parties, the
service provider may place a cookie on or retrieve a cookie from your
computer if you have not disabled your browser from receiving cookies. <br>

      <br>

If you wish, you can prevent cookie files from using (non-personal)
information about you by either deleting the cookie folder in your
browser or by putting your browser's Privacy setting higher, but doing
so will mean that (a) your use of the Site will be adversely affected
(and quite possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this
and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your
experience will be adversely affected, and (c) you will not be
presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our, and
other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at
this site: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>

      <h4><strong>Web Beacons and Clear GIFs</strong></h4>

      <p>We gather and share anonymised information concerning
the usage of the Site by members and travelers with one or more
third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.
In this connection, some of the pages you visit on our Site use
electronic images placed in the web page code, called pixel tags (also
called a "clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons") that can serve many of the same
purposes as cookies. <br>

      <br>

Web beacons may be used to track the traffic patterns of users from one
page to another in order to maximize web traffic flow. <br>

      <br>

The Site's third-party advertising service providers may also use Web
Beacons to recognize you when you visit the Site and to help determine
how you found the Site. If you would like more information about this
practice and to know your choices about not having this information
used by these companies, click here: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a></p>

      <h4><strong>How we protect your privacy with third
parties</strong></h4>

      <ul>

        <li>As indicated above, we may work with other companies
who place cookies or web beacons on our Site. These companies help
operate our Site and provide you with additional products and services.
They are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal
restrictions. We do not permit any of these companies to collect
personal information using cookies or web beacons on our Site. </li>

        <li>Some of these companies - such as DoubleClick - are
our service providers who place cookies that help us serve our own
content and compile anonymous site metrics and analytics. We require
these companies to use the information they collect only to provide us
with these services under contract. </li>

        <li>We participate in cookie-based ad networks operated
by Exelate, Revenue Science and Tacoda. This means that these companies
may use some anonymous information about you (based on a cookie on your
computer) to display ads. We do not permit these companies to collect
any personal information about you. Tacoda collects anonymous
information using cookies to tailor the advertising you see on our Site
or elsewhere on the web. Click these links to learn more about
