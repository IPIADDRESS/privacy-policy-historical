<li class="psubtitle">LEGAL STATEMENT</li>
<li>Policy and guidelines for use of marks in advertising, promotion and display </li>
<li>Vacation Express and its affiliates have the exclusive rights to use the Vacation Express service mark and other Vacation Express marks and logos. Under the trademark laws, the Vacation Express companies must prevent the use of their names and marks in ways that could give customers and potential customers the mistaken impression that the Vacation Express company owns or is affiliated with an agency using its marks.

Please adhere to the following specific rules when using Vacation Express names and marks in promotions on Internet websites and in print advertisements. </li>
<li class="psubtitle">General Rules </li>
<li>All uses of the Vacation Express name or any Vacation Express mark must relate solely to Vacation Express travel packages and not to the agencies selling them. Agencies that sell Vacation Express packages may not refer to themselves in any context as "Vacation Express travel agents" or to their businesses as "official Vacation Express travel agencies." </li>
<li>Travel agencies may only use signage, window displays, or point of purchase items employing the Vacation Express name or any Vacation Express mark (a) as provided by Vacation Express, or (b) as approved in writing by Vacation Express. </li>
<li>No one may copy any content appearing in any Vacation Express website, brochure, or advertising without express written permission from Vacation Express. </li>

<li class="psubtitle">Internet Websites </li>
<li>No one may use the name Vacation Express or any Vacation Express mark (or anything confusingly similar) as part of an Internet domain name. No agency may display the Vacation Express mark by itself on a website without prior written approval. </li>
<li>Travel agencies may use the Vacation Express mark in a website in the following ways: a. The Vacation Express mark may be used as part of a statement such as "We sell Vacation Express travel packages," so long as all of the words in the sentence are of a similar size. b. The Vacation Express mark may be used in conjunction with links, schedules, product descriptions, or order forms, expressly referring to the sale of Vacation Express travel products by the agency. c. In any case where the Vacation Express name or mark is used, the name of the travel agency must appear on the same screen, above the Vacation Express name or mark, and in a size at least 125% of the size of the Vacation Express name or mark used. </li>
<li class="psubtitle">Print Advertising </li>
<li>No Vacation Express marks may appear in Yellow Pages advertising. </li>
<li>As discussed above, truthful, informational statements are permitted in promotional materials and advertisements, such as, "We sell Vacation Express travel packages."
