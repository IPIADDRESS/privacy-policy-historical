				We at Vault ("Vault") are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. We also want to 
				provide you with a more rewarding Internet experience by making the advertising and content you see on Vault's 
				services (collectively, the "Services") relevant to you, based on who you are and where your interests lie. 
				Your loyalty as either a visitor or a Member (i.e., an individual who signs up for access to one or more Services) 
				is important, and we hope that our concerns regarding your privacy, as described in this policy (the "Privacy 
				Policy" or "Policy"), demonstrate our commitment to making your Vault experience an enjoyable and useful one.<br><br>
				
				Note that, by using the Services, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this 
				Policy, please do not use the Services. Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes to this Policy 
				will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please bookmark this page and review it frequently. If you
				have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, the Services, or Vault, please e-mail us at 
				<a href="mailto:feedback@staff.vault.com">feedback@staff.vault.com</a>. 
				If we change the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by e-mail and await your 
				response for 20 days before making the change.<br>&nbsp;<br>

				<b>I. The information we gather </b><br>
				Although most parts of the Services do not require you to be a Member (and you can therefore use them without 
				submitting any "personally identifiable information," that is, information that relates to an identified 
				individual), some areas - such as our detailed online profiles and industry guides - do. In order to become a 
				Member, individuals are required to provide us with (a) an e-mail address and a unique user name and password, 
				as well as certain personally identifying and other information such as the Member's zip code, country, 
				industry and occupation and (b) before making a purchase, the Member's name, address, phone number, 
				payment information (including credit card information), and other shipping information. Once you complete 
				your registration, you will be given the opportunity to submit additional personally identifying information 
				to create an "online profile" (the "Profile"). In your Profile, we ask for optional contact information, 
				including demographic information (like age, or income level). Your contact information is also used to 
				contact you when necessary. You may op-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section 
				below. Demographic and profile data are also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your 
				experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the 
				content according to your preferences. We also use demographic information to target advertisements to 
				users from specific demographics.<br><br> 
				
				Vault also collects non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not identify a 
				specific individual), such as aggregate use statistics for the Services, for both visitors and Members. 
				We collect such non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" - that is, 
				small text files placed on your computer's hard drive. We collect some basic information about your computer 
				and Internet connections, including: (1) your IP address (your computer's unique signature); (2) your operating 
				system (e.g., Windows or Mac); (3) your browser software (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); (4) your
			    Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL or AT&amp;T); (5) your geographic location (e.g., New York, NY.); 
				(6) your IP address. Collecting this information helps us streamline your experience on the Services - 
				for example, helping us diagnose problems with our server, administering our Web site, by "automatically" 
				filling out forms for you, or keeping track of the contents of your online shopping cart.<br><br>
				
				Vault's Services include banner advertising that links to third-party sites.  Please note that our advertisers 
				and their designees, as well as other third parties, may collect information about you through cookies or 
				other technologies when you visit their Web site(s). Vault uses a third party, Real Media, to serve the 
				advertisements that you see on the pages of our Web site.<br><br> 
							
				Vault also uses third-party advertising companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative
				("NAI") network and who employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure
				ane improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients.  To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your
				visits to our web site and other web sites.  This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad
				that was shown, their cookie, the IP address.  This information can also be used for online preference
				marketing purposes.
				<br><br>
				If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each
				ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network
				advertising cookies.  <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Click here</a> for the NAI gateway opt-out site.  This site will also allow you to review
				the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.
				<br><br>
				
				<b>II. Third-party partners</b><br>
				
				Additionally, the Services contain links to other third party Web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated 
				sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with Vault. You acknowledge that we do not 
				monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, and are not responsible 
				for their practices or the content of their web sites, including their use of any information (such as IP number, 
				browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors or Members "click through" links to their sites or view 
				advertisements served by them. Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify 
				you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third 
				parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.<br><br>
				
				The co-branded sites include ones from Homefair.com, Salary.com, eNews.com, ce.com (Career Experience), bplans.com, 
				freeagent.com, eocenter.com, click2learn.com and eNews.com. Click2Learn.com and eNews.com sites include separate
				registration forms.<br><br>
				
				For certain opt-in services, user information is sent to third parties.  These services and third parties include:<br><br>
				
				
				<ul>
					<li>Billing information is sent to Ingram and iSubs for book and magazine orders, respectively.<br>
				
					</li><li>Billing information is sent to Cybercash for verification.<br>
				
					</li><li>Contact information is sent to featured vendors as a user requests.  
				View the <a href="/admin2/bgclientlist.jsp">list of featured vendors</a>.<br>
				
					</li><li>Job description information, (industry, location, nature of job, etc.), and contact information (e-mail or fax required, other contact information optional) 
					are sent to job posting media as a user requests.<br><br> 
				</li></ul>
				<b>III. How we use (and do not use) the information we gather</b><br> 
				
				Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. 
				Keep in mind that, while Vault encourages all third parties involved - including but not limited to its 
				advertisers - to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and Members and to otherwise
				 handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any 
				 actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either 
				 from Vault or independently. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, 
				 or who claims association with Vault, who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about 
				 you, please contact <a href="mailto:feedback@staff.vault.com">feedback@staff.vault.com</a>.<br><br>
				
				<b>(a) Choice/Opt-Out.</b> Vault provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving most communications from Vault, 
				and/or its affiliates, advertisers, and other business partners from your Vault Member Home Page. You have the option to remove your information from our database and to not receive 
				future communications or to no longer receive our service. We also give you the option to change or 
				modify the information previously provided. To exercise any of the foregoing options:<br><br>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>You can send e-mail to <a href="mailto:webmaster@staff.vault.com">webmaster@staff.vault.com</a> <br>
					</li><li>You can send mail to the following postal address: 150 W. 22nd St., 5th Floor, New York, NY 10011 <br>
					</li><li>You can call the following telephone number: 212-366-4212<br><br> 
				</li></ol>
				
				Note that, because Vault will occasionally need to send you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your 
				use of the Services, such as announcements, system status updates or order confirmations, you will not be 
				able to "opt out" of receiving such messages.<br><br>   
				
				<b>(b) How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information.</b> We use non-personally identifiable 
				information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses 
				of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and Members, and by measuring demographics and 
				interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data 
				to advertisers and other current and potential business partners.<br><br>  
				
				<b>(c) How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information.</b> Please note that Vault reserves the right to 
				disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or Member as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect 
				our systems or business. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information 
				when a visitor or Member is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is 
				reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, 
				or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas,
				 discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement. We 
				 cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal 
				 activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation 
				 or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing 
				 activity.<br><br>  
				
				Subject to the foregoing, Vault uses your personally identifying information in several ways:<br><br>   
				<ul>
					<li>to customize various aspects of the Services to your preferences; <br>  
					</li><li>to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen; <br>  
					</li><li>to send you Vault solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be of interest to you 
					(you may "opt out" of receiving these materials, as provided below); and <br>  
					</li><li>as may be necessary to support the operation of the Services, such as for billing, account maintenance, and 
				record-keeping purposes. <br><br><br>
				</li></ul>
				
				Vault may disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties as follows:<br><br> 
				<ul>
				<li>with your authorization, such as when you click on a "submit order" or similar button when placing an order 
				(your personally identifiable information will be shared with the merchant advertising the good or service you wish to 
				purchase, so that such merchant may complete the transaction and ship the items(s) you have purchased); and <br>
				</li><li>if you do not "opt out" of receiving promotional materials (as discussed below), to third parties who provide 
				goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you; <br>
				</li><li>to our contractors and consultants, and professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the 
				extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable disclosure restrictions. <br><br>
				</li></ul>
				If you provide us with your credit card information, we will not release that information to third parties unless necessary 
				to complete a transaction between you and such a third party. (Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party 
				financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify 
				the credit card numbers and process transactions.)<br><br>
				
				
				<b>IV. Where we collect information</b><br>
				
				Vault collects information from users in the following areas of the site:<br><br>
				
				1) Membership<br>
				In this area, information such as e-mail address, zip code, current industry, and current occupation is requested of users 
				who wish to become Vault members.  Employers and managers who wish to take advantage of Vault's recruiting services such as 
				our free job board are also asked to provide information about their company, such as company size and name.<br><br>  
				
				2) Newsletter subscription boxes<br>
				From various areas of the site, users can submit their e-mail to receive free Vault newsletters.  No other information is 
				required.<br><br>

				When purchasing books through Vault's bookstore, users must provide shipping and billing information (including credit card 
				information).<br><br> 
				
				4) Member Network profile submission form<br>

				job and location sought.  In addition, members may submit their resume to our resume database, which employers can view.  <br><br>
				
				7) Vault surveys<br>
				Users who opt to fill out our surveys are asked for varied information depending on the survey.<br><br>

				Users who request to receive information from the vendors listed in our free product information area are asked for 
				contact information that is sent to the vendors, including e-mail and mailing address.<br><br>
				9) Throughout the web site, including message board postings, we collect your IP address.<br><br>		
						
				10) When signing up for the Vault Campus Club you must provide additional profile information. Vault will never share, 
				rent or sell this information but will use it to customize your experience including sending you emails on behalf of companies 
				that have jobs or opportunities that match your profile. This profile information may be modified by you at any time in your
				 Member Home on the Vault.com website.<br><br>

				<b>V. Surveys and Sweepstakes</b><br>
				
				Occasionally, Vault may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your 
				needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. 
				In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction 
				with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area 
				for the sweepstakes or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that 
				particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully.  These surveys and sweepstakes are always 
				optional.<br><br>
				
				<b>VI. Public Forums</b><br>
				Vault makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these 
				areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.<br>  If you choose to join Vault's Member Network and post messages under your public Vault username, your Member Network profile will be accessible to Vault members.  Joining the Vault Member Network is optional. 
				
				To maintain the stated standards of its community (read the rules of our message boards), Vault reserves the right 
				to monitor and read all messages posted on the boards.<br> <br> 
				
				<b>VII. Age</b> <br> 
				Vault's web site does not target children under the age of 13.  In the event that we discover that personally 
				identifiable information has been collected from a child under 13, we will delete that information.<br><br> 
				
				
				<b>VIII. Changing or deleting personal information</b><br> 
				You may view and, if you wish, change certain personally identifiable information by logging in to the Services with 
				your user name and password on the Vault's Members Home Page. For security reasons, you will not be able to see your credit 
				card number (if you have supplied one) or your password. You may also view and, if you wish, change information you 
				submitted as part of your Profile (if any) on the Members Home Page.<br><br>
				
				
				<b>IX. Communication with users</b><br>
				Vault communicates with its users primarily through e-mail, and for a variety of purposes.  These communications 
				include:<br>
				
				Opt-in subscription services.  These include e-mailed newsletters, e-mailed job postings, and other notifications of
				personalized content, including:<br><br>
				
				<ul>
					<li>E-mailed confirmations upon successful registration as members.<br>
				
					</li><li>E-mailed reminders as job listings that a user has posted are about to expire.<br>
				
					</li><li>E-mailed confirmations about orders users have placed on our site through our bookstore.<br> 
				
					</li><li>Occasional e-mails to be informed of changes and new features at Vault<br>
				
					</li><li>Invitations to complete registration if a user began registration for a service but did not complete it.<br><br>
				</li></ul>
				
				
				Finally, if a user has indicated that they are willing to share information about their work experience, 
				they may be contacted via telephone or e-mail to answer questions.<br><br>
				
				<b>X. Contacting the Web site.</b><br>
				 If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, 
				 contact:  <a href="mailto:webmaster@staff.vault.com">webmaster@staff.vault.com</a>. If you have advice for Vault,
