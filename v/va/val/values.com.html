		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Effective December 16, 2015</p>

		<p>Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and disclosure of
		information collected online by our website at www.values.com (including any
		subpages or mobile versions thereof) or any other website where this policy is
		posted (each, the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This Privacy Policy (the&nbsp;“<strong>Policy</strong>”) forms an
		agreement between you and Foundation for a Better Life, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
		(“<strong>FBL</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>we</strong>”). 
		Through your continued use of our Site, you
		consent to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

		<p>This Policy describes what information we may collect, how we may collect it,
		with whom we may share it, and other matters related to the information we
		collect from our Site, including your choices regarding collection and
		disclosure to third parties. This Policy is incorporated into our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>
		and may include terms that are defined in that agreement. Unless stated
		otherwise, this Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
		collect from you online through our Site.</p>

		<p>Please note, for some services or features, we may collect and transfer
		information to a service provider or, where allowed by applicable law, to
		educators, recruiters, our affiliates or other entities. Should you arrive at a
		third-party site or service when using our Site, please take a moment to
		review the privacy policies of third-party sites before you disclose
		information to them.</p>

		<h3>What Personal Information do we collect<br>and how do we use it?</h3>

		<p>For the purposes of this policy, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information
		that can be used to identify you as an individual, including your: full name;
		address; online contact information; telephone number; any persistent
		identifier that can be used to recognize you over time and across different
		services; precise geolocation information; and any information about an
		individual linked to such identifying information.</p>

		<h5>When you contact us through the Site</h5>

		<p>On our Site, we request your name and email address directly from you if you
		contact us through our “contact us” form. We will use Personal Information
		collected from the “contact us” form only as necessary to respond to your
		inquiry.</p>

		<h5>When you register on our website</h5>

		<p>We collect additional Personal Information when a user registers with our
		Site. For example, if you choose to sign up using your email address, we will
		collect your email, name, and the location you designate. If you sign up using
		a social media plugin, we will receive the information indicated by that
		service, such as your public profile, friend list, tweets, followers, and/or
		email address. We collect this information so that we can send you our daily
		inspirational emails and monthly newsletters, other information you may
		request, or to allow you to participate in various initiatives we may feature
		on our Site.</p>

		<h5>When you submit User Content</h5>

		<p>When you submit User Content to our Site, such as a story about a personal
		hero, a photo and other information submitted through the “Create your own
		Billboard” feature, or a personal story, we will collect, store, and may make
		public any information you provide. In addition, our Site may facilitate
		sharing of information you post, or information you share through social
		media, on our Site or elsewhere (for example, if you “tweet” content to one of
		the Twitter hashtags for which content is featured in widgets on our Site,
		that content may appear within the widget).  Please do not submit any
		information through these features or otherwise post content on our Site,
		unless you wish to make this content public.</p>

		<h5>If you request materials from us</h5>

		<p>If you request materials from us, such as educational resources or media
		versions of our Content, we may request additional information from you. We
		may request your name, mailing address, phone number, organizational
		affiliation, and other information necessary to process your transaction. This
		information will be used only in the context of your request and not
		associated with your profile or shared, except as may be necessary for
		processing.</p>

		<h5>Third party sites and services</h5>

		<p>Please be aware, certain services available on or through our Site may be
		provided by third parties. You may also visit other third party sites through
		links on our Site. These third parties are not bound by this policy and may
		have privacy policies of their own governing the use and disclosure of your
		Personal Information. Please read any policies of third parties before you
		provide Personal Information to them.</p>

		<h3>Cookies and online tracking</h3>

		<p>Our Site may use cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies. These
		technologies are widely used for security, to learn about and improve upon how
		users navigate a website, or to enable certain features. Cookies are small
		data files that are transferred to your hard drive when your browser settings
		permit the acceptance of cookies. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or
		pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG,
		which are opened on a page or in an email. The request for these files from a
		server can reveal certain information, such as your browser type, IP address,
		and other information. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking
		technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

		<p>By tracking how and when you use our Site, these technologies help us
		determine which features and content on our Site are most important to our
		visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
		you can turn off cookies through your browser’s settings; however, this may
		eliminate our ability to provide you with a personalized or user-friendly
		experience on our Site.</p>

		<p>Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may
		help protect your privacy. However, because there is not yet a defined
		response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser’s
		do-not-track request.</p>

		<p>Our Site may use cookies provided by website analytics services such as Google
		Analytics to help us better understand how our Site is used.  To learn more
		about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google
		Analytics Terms of Use</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>, or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">Google Analytics Opt-
		out</a>.</p>

		<h3>With whom may we share your<br>Personal Information?</h3>

		<p>We generally do not share the Personal Information you provide us, including
		your registration information, except as described in this Privacy Policy.
		However, if you provide us information about a hero, share a story, create
		your own billboard, or otherwise provide information through features intended
		to share content on our Site, your information will be available to the
		general public on our Site or through our social media channels. Please do not
		share any information through these features that you do not want public.</p>

		<p>We may share a limited amount of your Personal Information with service
		providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the circumstances
		noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect
		with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services,
		or other service providers.  We may also occasionally share Personal
		Information with our related entities (e.g.  for special joint initiatives of
		our organizations) or we may occasionally share with third parties who have
		information we believe would be of interest to you.</p>

		<p>Further, we may share Personal Information we possess as part of a sale or
		transfer our business, or substantially all of our assets. To the extent
		permitted by laws, we may share Personal Information if we need to protect the
		interests of FBL, our customers, property, or the public. Similarly, we may
		share Personal Information with governmental authorities or otherwise in
		response to a legal request that we believe requires us to do so. We will
		share any such information to the extent we believe that request requires.
		Legal requests include, for example, search warrants, subpoenas, and other
		court orders. We may also receive legal requests or orders from jurisdictions
		outside the United States, in which case you consent for your Personal
		Information to be transferred to the applicable country.</p>

		<h3>How can I access, update, or delete my Personal Information?</h3>

		<p>If your Personal Information was posted on our Site by a third party, for
		example through the personal hero submission feature, we will accommodate any
		reasonable request to remove your information. To do so, please contact us at
		the address listed below.</p>

		<p>You may also access or update any Personal Information we hold about you by
		sending a letter or email using the contact information listed below. We will
		respond to reasonable requests for access or revision and will provide access
		to the extent required or allowed by law. However we may decide not to grant
		access or make revisions where the burden or expense of providing access would
		be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given
		case, or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access.</p>

		<h3>Is my Personal Information secured?</h3>

		<p>We use reasonable security measures to protect any Personal Information held
		by FBL. We implement and regularly review various physical, procedural and
		technological safeguards that we believe will keep your Personal Information
		secure.</p>

		<h3>International guests</h3>

		<p>If you are accessing this Site from outside of the United States, you consent
		to the transfer of your information to the United States, and the processing,
		use, and sharing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		Regardless of where your information is collected or transferred, the
		information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h3>Rights of parents and children</h3>

		<p>Our Site is intended for general audiences, such as educators, parents, and
		the general public, but is not directed to children.&nbsp;If a child under the age
		of 13 were to use our Site, because our Site is designed for general
		audiences, the personal information collected from the child would be the same
		as that collected from adults, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
		Parents should be aware that our Site may include features by which our users
		may share content with others on our Site or via social media. If a child were
		to use these features of our Site, the child could potentially disclose
		personal information to other users of all ages via those services.  Please be
		aware of any privacy policies of these third party social media sites before
		allowing your child to use them.</p>

		<p>Parents may review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection
		or use of their children's personal information.&nbsp; Parents may also choose to
		agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but not allow
		disclosure of such information to third parties unless it is inherently part
		of the Site.&nbsp; Parents may request any of these actions, or make inquiries
		regarding our privacy practices, by sending an email or letter to us at the
		address below.</p>

		<p>To the extent required by California Law, we permit minors under the age of 18
		to request the deletion of any content or information that the minor has made
		available through our Site to other users of the Site. To request that
		information you have made available on our Site be removed, please send a
		letter or email to the address below with (i) your name, (ii) a complete
		description of the content you would like removed, and (iii) the web
		address(es) of the content you would like removed. Please be aware that our
		fulfillment of this request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal
		of the content or information you have posted on our Site.</p>
