				<p>Updated December 16, 2015</p>

				<p>Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and disclosure of
				information collected online by our website at www.passiton.com (including any
				subpages or mobile versions thereof) or any other website where this policy is
				posted (each, the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This Privacy Policy (the&nbsp;“<strong>Policy</strong>”) forms an
				agreement between you and Foundation for a Better Life, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
				(“<strong>FBL</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” or “<strong>we</strong>”).
				Through your continued use of our Site, you
				consent to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

				<p>This Policy describes what information we may collect, how we may collect it,
				with whom we may share it, and other matters related to the information we
				collect from our Site, including your choices regarding collection and
				disclosure to third parties. This Policy is incorporated into our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>
				and may include terms that are defined in that agreement. Unless stated
				otherwise, this Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
				collect from you online through our Site.</p>

				<p>Please note, for some services or features, we may collect and transfer
				information to a service provider or, where allowed by applicable law, to
				educators, recruiters, our affiliates or other entities. Should you arrive at a
				third-party site or service when using our Site, please take a moment to
				review the privacy policies of third-party sites before you disclose
				information to them.</p>

				<h3>What Personal Information do we collect and how do we use it?</h3>

				<p>For the purposes of this policy, “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information
				that can be used to identify you as an individual, including your: full name;
				address; online contact information; telephone number; any persistent
				identifier that can be used to recognize you over time and across different
				services; precise geolocation information; and any information about an
				individual linked to such identifying information.</p>

				<h5>WHEN YOU CONTACT US THROUGH THE SITE</h5>

				<p>On our Site, we request your name and email address directly from you if you
				contact us through our “contact us” form. We will use Personal Information
				collected from the “contact us” form only as necessary to respond to your
				inquiry.</p>

				<h5>WHEN YOU REGISTER ON OUR WEBSITE</h5>

				<p>We collect additional Personal Information when a user registers with our
				Site. For example, if you choose to sign up using your email address, we will
				collect your email, name, and the location you designate. If you sign up using
				a social media plugin, we will receive the information indicated by that
				service, such as your public profile, friend list, tweets, followers, and/or
				email address. We collect this information so that we can send you our daily
				inspirational emails and monthly newsletters, other information you may
				request, or to allow you to participate in various initiatives we may feature
				on our Site.</p>

				<h5>WHEN YOU SUBMIT USER CONTENT</h5>

				<p>When you submit User Content to our Site, such as a story about a personal
				hero, a photo and other information submitted through the “Create your own
				Billboard” feature, or a personal story, we will collect, store, and may make
				public any information you provide. In addition, our Site may facilitate
				sharing of information you post, or information you share through social
				media, on our Site or elsewhere (for example, if you “tweet” content to one of
				the Twitter hashtags for which content is featured in widgets on our Site,
				that content may appear within the widget).  Please do not submit any
				information through these features or otherwise post content on our Site,
				unless you wish to make this content public.</p>

				<h5>IF YOU REQUEST MATERIALS FROM US</h5>

				<p>If you request materials from us, such as educational resources or media
				versions of our Content, we may request additional information from you. We
				may request your name, mailing address, phone number, organizational
				affiliation, and other information necessary to process your transaction. This
				information will be used only in the context of your request and not
				associated with your profile or shared, except as may be necessary for
				processing.</p>

				<h5>THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h5>

				<p>Please be aware, certain services available on or through our Site may be
				provided by third parties. You may also visit other third party sites through
				links on our Site. These third parties are not bound by this policy and may
				have privacy policies of their own governing the use and disclosure of your
				Personal Information. Please read any policies of third parties before you
				provide Personal Information to them.</p>

				<h3>COOKIES AND ONLINE TRACKING</h3>

				<p>Our Site may use cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies. These
				technologies are widely used for security, to learn about and improve upon how
				users navigate a website, or to enable certain features. Cookies are small
				data files that are transferred to your hard drive when your browser settings
				permit the acceptance of cookies. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or
				pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG,
				which are opened on a page or in an email. The request for these files from a
				server can reveal certain information, such as your browser type, IP address,
				and other information.</p>

				<p>By tracking how and when you use our Site, these technologies help us
				determine which features and content on our Site are most important to our
				visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
				you can turn off cookies through your browser’s settings; however, this may
				eliminate our ability to provide you with a personalized or user-friendly
				experience on our Site.</p>

				<p>Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may
				help protect your privacy. However, because there is not yet a defined
				response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser’s
				do-not-track request.</p>

				<p>Our Site may use cookies provided by website analytics services such as Google
				Analytics to help us better understand how our Site is used.  To learn more
				about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google
				Analytics Terms of Use</a>, the <a href="https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>, or <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">Google Analytics Opt-
				out</a>.</p>

				<h3>With whom may we share your Personal Information?</h3>

				<p>We generally do not share the Personal Information you provide us, including
				your registration information, except as described in this Privacy Policy.
				However, if you provide us information about a hero, share a story, create
				your own billboard, or otherwise provide information through features intended
				to share content on our Site, your information will be available to the
				general public on our Site or through our social media channels. Please do not
				share any information through these features that you do not want public.</p>

				<p>We may share a limited amount of your Personal Information with service
				providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the circumstances
				noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect
				with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services,
				or other service providers.  We may also occasionally share Personal
				Information with our related entities (e.g.  for special joint initiatives of
				our organizations) or we may occasionally share with third parties who have
				information we believe would be of interest to you.</p>

				<p>Further, we may share Personal Information we possess as part of a sale or
				transfer our business, or substantially all of our assets. To the extent
				permitted by laws, we may share Personal Information if we need to protect the
				interests of FBL, our customers, property, or the public. Similarly, we may
				share Personal Information with governmental authorities or otherwise in
				response to a legal request that we believe requires us to do so. We will
				share any such information to the extent we believe that request requires.
				Legal requests include, for example, search warrants, subpoenas, and other
				court orders. We may also receive legal requests or orders from jurisdictions
				outside the United States, in which case you consent for your Personal
				Information to be transferred to the applicable country.</p>

				<h3>How can I access, update, or delete my Personal Information?</h3>

				<p>If your Personal Information was posted on our Site by a third party, for
				example through the personal hero submission feature, we will accommodate any
				reasonable request to remove your information. To do so, please contact us at
				the address listed below.</p>

				<p>You may also access or update any Personal Information we hold about you by
				sending a letter or email using the contact information listed below. We will
				respond to reasonable requests for access or revision and will provide access
				to the extent required or allowed by law. However we may decide not to grant
				access or make revisions where the burden or expense of providing access would
				be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given
				case, or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access.</p>

				<h3>Is my Personal Information secured?</h3>

				<p>We use reasonable security measures to protect any Personal Information held
				by FBL. We implement and regularly review various physical, procedural and
				technological safeguards that we believe will keep your Personal Information
				secure.</p>

				<h3>International guests</h3>

				<p>If you are accessing this Site from outside of the United States, you consent
				to the transfer of your information to the United States, and the processing,
				use, and sharing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
				Regardless of where your information is collected or transferred, the
				information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

				<h3>Rights of parents and children</h3>

				<p>Our Site is intended for general audiences, such as educators, parents, and
				the general public, but is not directed to children.&nbsp;If a child under the age
				of 13 were to use our Site, because our Site is designed for general
				audiences, the personal information collected from the child would be the same
				as that collected from adults, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
				Parents should be aware that our Site may include features by which our users
				may share content with others on our Site or via social media. If a child were
				to use these features of our Site, the child could potentially disclose
				personal information to other users of all ages via those services.  Please be
				aware of any privacy policies of these third party social media sites before
				allowing your child to use them.</p>

				<p>Parents may review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection
				or use of their children's personal information.&nbsp; Parents may also choose to
				agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but not allow
				disclosure of such information to third parties unless it is inherently part
				of the Site.&nbsp; Parents may request any of these actions, or make inquiries
				regarding our privacy practices, by sending an email or letter to us at the
				address below.</p>

				<p>To the extent required by California Law, we permit minors under the age of 18
				to request the deletion of any content or information that the minor has made
				available through our Site to other users of the Site. To request that
				information you have made available on our Site be removed, please send a
				letter or email to the address below with (i) your name, (ii) a complete
				description of the content you would like removed, and (iii) the web
				address(es) of the content you would like removed. Please be aware that our
				fulfillment of this request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal
				of the content or information you have posted on our Site.</p>

				<h3>Limitation of liability</h3>

				<p>By providing us with any Personal Information, you expressly and
				unconditionally release and hold harmless <a href="https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/">randomactsofkindness.org</a>, its
				parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies and their respective
				shareholders, owners, members, directors, officers, employees and agents
				(collectively, the “Releasees”) from any and all liability for any injuries,
				loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or
				misuse of your collected Personal Information. In addition, while we take
				reasonable steps to prevent third party companies from making unauthorized use
				of your Personal Information, we cannot be held liable for any injuries, loss
				or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse
				of your collected Personal Information by those third parties.</p>

				<h3>Changes to this policy</h3>

				<p>This policy may change from time to time. We will post the most current
				version of this policy on our website with the effective date. Your continued
				use of the website means you consent to the terms of any new Policy.</p>
