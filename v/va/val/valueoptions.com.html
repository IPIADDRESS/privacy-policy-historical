(the “ValueOptions site”) is designed to help you learn more about getting help with life issues that are sensitive, emotional and often private. We respect your personal privacy and provide this informational statement so that you may better understand how we may collect and use aggregate and personal information about you. This Privacy Statement describes ValueOptions privacy and security practices for this Web site. Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the ValueOptions site also apply to the ValueOptions Mobile Device Applications (or “App”) available for mobile devices, including, but not limited to iPhone’s, iPad’s, Android’s and/or other smart devices.</p>

				<h3>Your Acceptance of These Terms</h3>
              <p>By using this site, you signify your acceptance of the terms of the ValueOptions Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement, please do not use the ValueOptions site and exit the site immediately. Your continued use of the ValueOptions site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes. </p>
				<h3>Your IP Address</h3>
            <p>For  each visitor to the ValueOptions site, ValueOptions servers automatically  collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain  name (e.g., valueoptions.com) of visitors. We use your IP address to help  diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP  address is used to help identify you and to gather general demographic  information.</p>
				<h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>ValueOptions  may place a “cookie” on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of  information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for  record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry,  and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their  customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information,  but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the ValueOptions site. ValueOptions uses the information for editorial purposes and for other  purposes, such as delivery of features and advertisements, so that ValueOptions  can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without  compromising privacy. For example, we may use cookies to save your password so  you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. </p>
				<h3>Disclosing Information</h3>
              <p>ValueOptions is the sole owner of the information collected  from you on the ValueOptions site. We will not sell, share, rent, lease, trade  or otherwise provide this information to independent third parties in ways  different from what is disclosed in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>ValueOptions will not disclose your personally identifiable  information to independent third parties other than those who help us operate  the ValueOptions site.</p>
<p>We may also share aggregated demographic and profile  information (information that does not allow you to be identified or contacted)  with our business partners for marketing and promotional purposes. The  aggregate information we share with our business partners is not linked to any  of your personally identifiable information. For example, ValueOptions may  provide information to third parties about how many people use our Web site,  what features of the Web site they use and how many users of the Web site live  in certain zip codes.</p>
<p>ValueOptions may disclose account information in special  cases (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation,  search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when ValueOptions has reason  to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact  or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally,  may be causing injury or harm to ValueOptions users or other persons or  violating the Terms and Conditions of this site.</p>
<p>In the event that ValueOptions, or any component  of ValueOptions’ operations, is merged with, or is acquired by, another entity,  then any such successor or acquiring entity may become the successor to our  obligations with respect to the personal information that you have provided to  ValueOptions, which would be necessary for the entity to effectively continue  ValueOptions’ business. By using the ValueOptions site, you consent to any such  use of your personal information by such an entity assuming control of  ValueOptions’ operations as a result of a merger, purchase of ValueOptions  assets, or liquidation of ValueOptions in bankruptcy or insolvency.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
              <p>This  site contains links to other sites. ValueOptions is not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, including any sites that  may indicate a special relationship or partnership with ValueOptions (such as  co-branded pages and “powered by” relationships). ValueOptions does not  disclose unique identifiers to those responsible for the linked sites. The  linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not  subject to ValueOptions’ control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always  review the privacy policies of the sites you visit by linking from our Web  site.</p>
				<h3>Our Partner Sites</h3>
              <p>Some  of the services accessible to you from the ValueOptions site are actually  performed by our partners. You can tell whether you are on the ValueOptions  site or a partner site by checking the Internet address (URL) in your browser  window. When you are on our partner sites, you are governed by our partner’s  privacy policy. </p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
              <p>This  site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and  alteration of the information under our control.</p>
				<h3>Mobile Device Applications </h3>
                <p>When you download and install one  of our Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation.  This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify  you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use  this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in  this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your  installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work  through your browser. Therefore the random number cannot be removed through  settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for  which we use Cookies, please do not use the App, and please use your mobile  device browser to access the ValueOptions site or our mobile optimized sites. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device, other than the  brand, make and model and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain Apps require  registration either to use the App or to use certain functionality in the App. </p>
<p>ValueOptions’ Apps obtain your consent (via an opt-in)  before using information from pin-pointing technology like GPS or cell tower  information. You can withdraw your consent (opt-out) for the use of “location” by ValueOptions at any time by changing your location services in the “Settings” function on your mobile device.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
              <p>We are  committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware that the  ValueOptions site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age  of 13. &nbsp;We do not collect personally  identifiable information from any person we actually know is a child under the  age of 13.</p>
<h3>Your Role in Protecting Your Privacy</h3>
              <p>If  you share a terminal with others, you may want to consider establishing an  anonymous e-mail account. In this way, e-mails that your receive from  ValueOptions, which may reflect behavioral health issues of interest to you,  cannot be linked to you. If you access ValueOptions.com through an e-mail  account or Internet access system maintained by your employer, please note that  it is possible that your employer may monitor your e-mail communications and  Internet use.</p>
				<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
              <p>This  Privacy Statement may be revised over time as new features are added to the Web  site or as Internet security and privacy standards evolve. We will post those  changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather,  how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We  do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Statement each time you use  the ValueOptions site, in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy  Statement. </p>
				<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
              <p>If  you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of the  ValueOptions site or your dealings with ValueOptions, you can contact us at:</p>
