	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p> When you visit an InfoSpace Site or use our products or services on another Web site in the InfoSpace Network, one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a Web site or use a service. When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit or use. Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users. Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web–based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service. Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user’s browser.  We use information collected from cookies and web beacons to track which pages our users view, which browsers they use and other information about user activity when visiting an InfoSpace Site or using our products and services. We may also use cookies to help us provide you with personalized features and preferences in a manner that is linked to personal user information you elect to share with us. We use action tags to compile statistics and other data about our users on an aggregate basis. </p>
	<p> We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer. However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies. </p>
	<p> On some InfoSpace Sites we engage third party advertisement networks that may place cookies on computers accessing and using those sites that collect non–personal information regarding the content accessed by the computer on those sites.  This information may be used by InfoSpace and its third party advertising network partners to identify and target related advertising to the user of such computer, when on Web sites within the third party’s advertising network of sites.  Some of these third party advertising networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and subject to the NAI Self–Regulatory Principles for Online Preference Marketing by Network Advertisers, available at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a> (the “NAI Principles”). If you would like to opt–out from these services, you may go to the NAI Non–PII Opt–Out Page, located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, or the opt–out page of the particular third party advertising network identified in the cookie.  In addition, these companies may offer you a way to directly opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies by visiting their Web sites and following their opt out procedures. </p>
