    <span class="bodytextbig">ValueClick Media is committed to earning your trust and  confidence. To better protect privacy, we provide this notice explaining our  online technology and information collection practices.</span><br>
    <br>
    As a  ValueClick Company, ValueClick Media strongly believes in a consumer's right to  privacy. ValueClick Media does not engage in the collection, distribution, sale  or use of personally identifiable information about Web Users, such as email  address, name, phone number and street address. All web user data collected by ValueClick  Media as part of the ad serving process is not personally identifiable (browser  type, for example) and is used in aggregate form. ValueClick Media does not  know your email address. ValueClick Media does not conduct individual web user  "profiling".<br>
    <br>
    Advertisers  using the ValueClick Media Network may collect personally identifiable  information explicitly provided by consumers for any purpose including the  purchase of goods and services, order shipment, and sweepstakes entry.  Personally identifiable information collected by Advertisers using the ValueClick  Media Network is subject to the privacy policies of the individual advertisers.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Technology</strong><br>
      <br>
    ValueClick Media uses a feature of Internet browsers called a  "cookie". Cookies are files that the Internet browser places on your  computer's hard drive. ValueClick Media also uses "web beacons", also  known as clear gif technology, or action tags. Web beacons are tiny colorless  image files placed in a web page, which are served by ValueClick Media and  counted when served. Web beacons are used to track the completion of  transactions and submittal of applications. <br>
    <br>
    Cookies are  used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements.  Cookies are not viruses and cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage  your computer. Cookies are used to ensure that when a web user clicks on an ad,  they are sent to the correct click-through destination. They are also used by  our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign, as well as  frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater  accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to  control the delivery of a series of ads to a web browser, and to limit the  number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.<br>
    <br>
    There are  many misconceptions about cookies and web beacons, some of which we will try to  clarify. Cookies and web beacons do not tell us an e-mail address or any other  personally identifiable information. ValueClick Media does not and cannot use  cookies or web beacons to retrieve personal information from your computer. It  is worth noting that the threat management chief for a leading  anti-virus/anti-spyware program has publicly stated that Cookies were  "harmless". <br>
    <br>
    Web Users  have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their  browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do  this. ValueClick Media also provides an opt-out cookie to block ValueClick  Media cookie placement.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
