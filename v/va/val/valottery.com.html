<p>You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our application, but your ability to use some of its features may be limited.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting the Lottery Services Portal, a website portal ("Portal") operated on behalf of the Virginia Lottery (herein “VAL,” "we" or "us") by VAL’s gaming system provider. This Portal is intended and authorized for use and access by official licensed VAL Retailers ("Retailer") only. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains the online information practices of the VAL and sets out what information we collect through the Portal, how we collect it, and what we do with it. Please contact us as indicated in the "Contact Us" section below if you have any questions or would like additional information. We may update this Policy from time to time, so please check this Policy periodically for changes.<strong></strong></p>
<h2 class="emerald-text">Your Information</h2>
<p>We may collect non-public, personal information when you use this Portal or when you communicate and/or interact with us through this Portal. Pursuant to Virginia Code §§ 2.2-3800, <em>et seq.</em>, “personal information” means all information that (i) describes, locates or indexes anything about an individual including, but not limited to, his social security number, driver's license number, agency-issued identification number, student identification number, real or personal property holdings derived from tax returns, and his education, financial transactions, medical history, ancestry, religion, political ideology, criminal or employment record, or (ii) affords a basis for inferring personal characteristics, such as finger and voice prints, photographs, or things done by or to such individual; and the record of his presence, registration, or membership in an organization or activity, or admission to an institution. "Personal information" shall not include routine information maintained for the purpose of internal office administration whose use could not be such as to affect adversely any data subject nor does the term include real estate assessment information. <span></span>Personal information does not include any public information about an individual that is available through federal, state or local public records or business information collected through the Portal. We will update your information as information is processed through the Portal and/or new information is made available to us in an effort to keep your information current, accurate and complete or inform you if we are unable to process any requested update and the reason. Only authorized Retailers who provide us with the requested information will be able to access and obtain Retailer reports, data and other information relevant to Retailer's account and status as a Retailer available by or through the Portal (as determined by us in our discretion), and/or otherwise participate in the Portal's activities and offerings ("Retailer Information"). Portal usage, measurement, analytics and other data and information available to us directly or from our service providers in aggregated or other non-personalized forms or formats are outside the scope of this Privacy Policy and not subject to the collection or usage restrictions set forth herein.</p>
<h2 class="emerald-text">Our Use of Your Information</h2>
<p>If we do receive your personal information through the Portal, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected or otherwise as described in this Policy. Specifically, we reserve all rights necessary to use and disclose your personal information as required and/or permitted pursuant to all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the VAL. We may use information submitted through the Portal to communicate with you about matters related to your status as a Retailer, your use of the features and services available through the Portal and additional products and services that may be of interest to you. We may combine information we collect about you through the Portal with information we obtain about you from other sources, including aggregate data from third parties. We will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of our organization unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so; (2) it is necessary to allow our service providers or agents to provide Retailer Information for us or on our behalf, (3) it is necessary to allow our vendors to provide you third-party products and services owned or controlled by them through this Portal, to provide services for the Portal for us or on our behalf, including processing, hosting and customer surveys, and to provide services and other products for vendor on vendor's behalf subject to additional terms and policies, (4) it is necessary in order to provide our Retailer Information to you, including in connection with the review, processing and consideration of any application for Retailer Information submitted by you, including verification, authentication, geolocation and authorization for any requests (and contacting you when necessary), (5) subject to applicable contractual or legal restrictions, it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements, (6) it is necessary in connection with other business purposes including, without limitation, operation and administration of this Portal and/or Retailer Information offered through the Portal, customer care or convenience, service quality, business management and operation, risk assessment, security, fraud and crime prevention/detection, monitoring, research and analysis, marketing, customer purchasing preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection, account maintenance and fulfillment activities, and awarding and payment of prizes, as applicable, including tax reporting and performance of other compliance and offset obligations required or permitted by law in connection therewith, (7) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as required by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and the Virginia state lottery laws, certain information collected through our Portal or provided by you to us through our Portal will be regarded as matters of public record and may be released by us to the public.</p>

<h2 class="emerald-text">Your Rights</h2>
<p>Subject to applicable terms and conditions, we may allow you to use the Portal for a reasonable period of time (as determined by us in our discretion) following your termination as a Retailer. Thereafter, we will only retain copies of your information as necessary for us to comply with governmental orders, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce any agreement you have entered into with us and as otherwise reasonably necessary for our business purposes, including compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the VAL, the Portal and the Retailer Information. The foregoing does not constitute, and we do not make any representation, express, implied or statutory, all of which are hereby expressly disclaimed, that all electronic copies of your information will be destroyed. For clarity, with respect to certain Retailer Information available through the Portal, our ability to remove or stop using information submitted from you that is fundamental to your ability to receive or continue to receive and/or benefit from the Retailer Information and Portal is limited by all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the VAL and that specific Product.</p>
<p>Use of Tools, "Cookies" and Links to Other Websites</p>

<p>We and our third-party service providers and partners may collect information relating to analytics, customer trends and patterns and use cookies and software tools to measure Portal usage and related information. If you are requesting Retailer Information and/or submitting Feedback to us through the Portal, we may also use cookies to keep track of the request from one web page to another.

In other cases, we may retain the cookie and/or online information you give us for your use in subsequent sessions and requests.<span style="text-align: left;"></span></p>

When you visit this Portal, we may view the IP address (which may include the city, domain address and service provider) of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of the device, understand the general location of visitors to this Portal and verify eligibility to participate in certain features and offerings of the Portal. We also may use this information to enhance this Portal.</p>
<p>Certain pages on our Portal contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow us and our third-party service providers and partners to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.</p>
<p>For third-party products and services available to you through this Portal, we may share any or all of the information we collect with such provider to assist in your receipt of and access to such products and services. In such circumstances, you may be asked to accept the terms and policies of such provider. You should read all applicable terms and policies carefully to ensure you understand how such third-party may use your information.<strong></strong></p>
<h2 class="emerald-text">Monitoring</h2>
<p>To ensure that we carry out your instructions accurately, improve our Portal, Retailer Information and services, provide security and enable compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, policies and procedures applicable to the VAL and its Portal and Retailer Information, we may monitor and/or record: (1) telephone calls; and (2) interactions, transactions and activities on this Portal. All recordings and other records are our sole property. Your access to the Portal constitutes your consent and agreement to such monitoring. The results of such monitoring may be used in civil or criminal actions as deemed appropriate or necessary by us.<strong></strong></p>
<h2 class="emerald-text">Security Statement</h2>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information, including keeping your personal information private and safe. You acknowledge, however, that no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, despite our efforts. Thus, while we will use and will require our applicable service providers to use reasonable means consistent with general industry standards to secure information you transmit to us consistent with our legal requirements, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties.<span style="text-align: left;"></span></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Technologies used by the Virginia Lottery</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device for record-keeping purposes. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on this application.&nbsp; Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our application while persistent cookies enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.&nbsp; Session cookies expire when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our application, but your ability to use some of its features may be limited.</p>
<p>As is true of most applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp; This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the application, to track how the application is used and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies used by Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>We and our third-party partners use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts to help us understand how users interact with our application and assist with managing our application. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, used to track the online movements of application users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s device hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on application pages and are approximately the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>The information collected by these technologies is not tied to any personal information you may have submitted to us.</p>
