        at our website more convenient, we gather information from you. We maintain 
        the privacy of your information using security technologies and adhere

        <strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect, and How Is It Used?</strong><br>
        <br>
        We collect information on which portions of our website visitors access 
        or visit. We also collect information volunteered by visitors, such as 
        survey information and/or website registrations. Any personal information 
        we collect is used for internal review and is either discarded or used 
        by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes such as those described 
        below. We keep confidential all personal information entered during registration. 
        <br>
        In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, 
        you choose what information to tell us. Examples of when you voluntarily 
        submit this kind of information include when you answer our polls, fill 
        out the registration page or send us feedback. Simple demographic information 
        such as street address, city and personal interests are optional. <br>
        <br>
        The information collected is used to send email reminders to our users 
        and information about promotions or other information we think will be 
        of interest. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our 
        email list, you can contact us in one of two ways. At any time, users 
        can unsubscribe by simply visiting the registration section of our website 
        and clicking the unsubscribe button. With each email sent, users also 
        have the option to opt-out of future mailings by simply sending a return 
        email stating this intention.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we also monitor 
        and track usage of our website, viewing and traffic patterns, customer 
        behavior and other similar information. We compile this information into 
        a statistical aggregate. We use this aggregate information as well as 
        your personal information for internal business and administrative purposes, 
        including to improve our website, our operations and our customer service.
