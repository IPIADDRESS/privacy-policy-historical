  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Arial">
  ValueAd.com we believe that you the consumer should own and control your 
  personal information. If you decide to share it anonymously with advertisers, 
  then you should be fairly compensated for it. In general, we will not share 
  your information with third parties without your permission and consent.</span></p>
  <h1>Information We Collect</h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Arial">Member 
  Profile. We create a Member Profile that is based upon: </span></p>
  <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">

    <li class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size:8.5pt;

  </ul>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Arial">We use

  <h1>How We Collect Information</h1>
  <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
    <li class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size:8.5pt;
     font-family:Arial">Registration and Surveys. We collect information when 
    you register for any of our services or participate in any surveys, 
    contests, or other offers. If you are signing up through a co-branded ISP, 
    website or service ("Participating Service"), some of your information may 
    be pre-filled based upon your previous registration with the Participating 
    Service. You may later modify your account information. </span></li>
    <li class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size:8.5pt;
     font-family:Arial">Ad Serving Technology. Our proprietary technology, 
    tracks information on your web surfing and sends it to us for use in your 
    Member Profile. The banner space then uses your information to display 
    advertisements and offers that may be relevant to you. The banner space only 
    transmits information directly to ValueAd.com, even if your membership is 
    through a Participating Service. </span></li>
    <li class="MsoNormal">
    <span style="font-size:8.5pt;
     font-family:Arial">Website collection of IP address. We record the IP 
    address of every visit to our site. An IP address is a unique number 
    assigned to a computer. It does not contain any personally identifying 
    information and will not be linked to your Membership Profile. </span></li>

    offers from advertisers, merchants, vendors ("Advertisers") and the like 
    based on your interests. For example, if your information indicates that you 
    enjoy traveling, the banner space may display a message regarding discount 
    airfares. We may aggregate anonymous Member Profiles into summaries of 
    information based on specific criteria that we then use to solicit banner 
    space advertisements and offers to forward to you. At no time do we share 
    information that would identify you individually unless you sign up through 
    a Participating Service (please see below). </span></li>
    <li class="MsoNormal">

    for account management purposes and to offer you better and more 
    personalized content and services. These businesses have agreed not to share 
    your information voluntarily with any outside parties. Please keep in mind
