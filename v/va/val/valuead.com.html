			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>ValueAd.com we believe that you the consumer should own and control your personal information. If you decide to share it anonymously with advertisers, then you should be fairly compensated for it. In general, we will not share your information with third parties without your permission and consent.</p>
			<h1>Information We Collect</h1>
			<p>Member Profile. We create a Member Profile that is based upon: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Personal information given at registration and</li>
				<li>Where you surf on the web (URL addresses).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We use this Member Profile to match advertisements and offers to your interests. If at anytime you do not want us to collect data on your surfing habits during an online session, simply close the page. We also collect the IP address of all visitors to the site.</p>
			<h1>How We Collect Information</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Registration and Surveys. We collect information when you register for any of our services or participate in any surveys, contests, or other offers. If you are signing up through a co-branded ISP, website or service ("Participating Service"), some of your information may be pre-filled based upon your previous registration with the Participating Service. You may later modify your account information.</li>
				<li>Ad Serving Technology. Our proprietary technology, tracks information on your web surfing and sends it to us for use in your Member Profile. The banner space then uses your information to display advertisements and offers that may be relevant to you. The banner space only transmits information directly to ValueAd.com, even if your membership is through a Participating Service.</li>
				<li>Website collection of IP address. We record the IP address of every visit to our site. An IP address is a unique number assigned to a computer. It does not contain any personally identifying information and will not be linked to your Membership Profile.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Use and Access of Information</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>We use the banner space to send you advertisements and 
				offers from advertisers, merchants, vendors ("Advertisers") and the like based on your interests. For example, if your information indicates that you enjoy traveling, the banner space may display a message regarding discount airfares. We may aggregate anonymous Member Profiles into summaries of information based on specific criteria that we then use to solicit banner space advertisements and offers to forward to you. At no time do we share information that would identify you individually unless you sign up through a Participating Service (please see below).</li>
				<li>If you choose to participate in a co-branded service such as internet access with a participating ISP, or another service or website, that Participating Service may have access to your Member Profile for account management purposes and to offer you better and more personalized content and services. These businesses have agreed not to share your information voluntarily with any outside parties. Please keep in mind that our co-branded Participating Services are separate from us, so we recommend you review their privacy policies, which may differ from ours concerning their collection and use of information.</li>
				<li>We use your personal information to manage your account for the services you have selected. Our employees and other parties acting on our behalf may have access to your information on a need-to-know basis. We may also use aggregate data of our members for promotional, business development, market research, and other general business purposes. We use your IP Address for systems administration and business reporting purposes to create aggregate information on all visits to our website. </li>
				<li>Our B-network service allows you to license information, including demographic and behavioral (surfing information) to Advertisers for a negotiated price. In addition, you can also elect to receive e-mail offers from an Advertiser for an agreed to price. Because e-mails are sent through ValueAd.com, your e-mail address remains private. Consumers are empowered with the ability to choose whether or not they want to exchange information and to determine the price. When you participate in B-network, your information remains anonymous to the party making the offer and is not personally identifiable.</li>
				<li>We may share your information with third parties where we are required to do so by law or where necessary to protect our interests. We may share your information without prior notice to you where required by law.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Links through the Banner Space or other Services of ValueAd.com</h1>

We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions, practices or policies of third parties, including any Participating Service, that is linked from our website, services, or banner space. When you click on ads and links via the banner space or participate in B-network, please carefully review the privacy policies and the terms of the specific offers you may receive from these parties if you want to know more about what information they collect and how it will be used.</p>
