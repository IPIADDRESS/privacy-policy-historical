</p>
						<p class="bodytext"> 						In order to compile our research studies, we may ask you to voluntarily submit  						personally identifiable information, which may include: 					</p><ul><li> 						your name and address, email address, telephone number and general contact  						details; 						</li><li> 						images on film, photographs and telephone voice recordings; 						</li><li> 						demographic information, such as your zip code, gender, country of origin or  						income level; 						</li><li> 						your racial or ethnic origin; 						</li><li> 						your political opinion(s) and/or political party with which you are affiliated; 						</li><li> 						your religious or spiritual beliefs; 						</li><li> 						whether or not you are a member of a labor union; 						</li><li> 						your physical or mental health or condition; 						</li><li> 						your sexual life; 						</li><li> 						your hobbies and interests; and 						</li><li> 							whether you have any type of criminal record, or have been arrested for any  							offense. 						</li></ul><p class="bodytext"> 						In addition, you will need to submit your email address and password to login  						to the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a> 						site.

If we send you a survey  						invitation or reminder by email, we will always provide the opportunity to  						opt-out of receiving future emails by following the "unsubscribe" instructions  						at the bottom of the email.&nbsp;
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"> 						We may also ask third parties to send survey invitation emails on our behalf.  						In such cases, the people who receive those emails can choose to click on a  						link to be directed to Research Now's registration page on its site. The  						individual can then decide whether or not to register with Research Now. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b>3. How We Use the Information You Provide</b> 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">If you have registered on the www.valuedopinions.com site, we will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the results of the surveys.

For example, Research Now provides our third-party fulfillment warehouse with names and mailing addresses so the warehouse can process and send paper gift certificates.
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b><i>Email Communications from Research Now</i></b> 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"> 						Research Now does not send unsolicited commercial emails. Nevertheless,  						Research Now voluntarily complies with the key privacy and disclosure  						provisions of the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act, including: 					</p><ul><li> 						providing truthful sender information; 						</li><li> 						including a physical address for Research Now Inc. or the Research Now Inc.  						affiliate sending the email message; and 						</li><li> 							providing a clear and simple opt-out method which is honored within ten (10)  							business days after the opt-out request is made. 						</li></ul><p class="bodytext"> 						In addition, all survey invitations sent via email are consistent with the  						CASRO Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research.

						<p class="bodytext"> 						Clients list the general demographic information (such as age range, ethnic  						background, and occupation) of individuals from whom they wish to ask survey  						questions. Based on the client's needs, Research Now contacts individuals who  						have registered on the site and invites them to participate in an online  						survey. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"> 						Answers to the surveys are associated with unique, but non-personally  						identifiable ID numbers in Research Now's databases. Research Now may aggregate  						and interpret the answers in reports. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b>4. Sharing Your Personal Information</b> 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share your personal information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our behalf, such as merchandise fulfillment, web hosting, and the like. Research Now may also share your personal data with affiliated companies in the Research Now group of companies (see "Company Background") or with unaffiliated third parties when permitted by law, as described above under "How We Use the Information You Provide". If Research Now acquires or spins off all or part of its business, or in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, it might convey its business assets, including survey participant data. If a change of ownership occurs, a notice will be posted here, so please check this policy regularly.
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b>5. Accessing the Personal Information You've Provided<br></b> 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"> 					If you provided personal information during registration or in response to a  					survey, you may change or modify such information by: 					</p><ul><li> 								Visiting the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.com</a> 							website, logging in, and updating your information; or 							</li><li> 								Sending an email to <a href="mailto:inquiries@valuedopinions.com">inquiries@valuedopinions.com</a></li></ul><p class="bodytext"> 						If you choose to stop participating in our research surveys, you may  						unsubscribe from our survey invitations at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:mailun@valuedopinions.com?Subject=Unsubscribe"> 							mailun@valuedopinions.com</a>. Please be aware that even if you  						unsubscribe, we may maintain certain information in your registration profile  						for up to five (5) years for ordinary business purposes, such as reporting the  						aggregate number of registrations and cancellations to our non-affiliated  						partners. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b>6. Safety and Security</b> 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">We use a variety of physical, administrative and technical measures to secure  						the data stored on our servers, including limiting physical access to our  						central data servers. Our policy is to allow only authorized personnel to  						access the physical areas where such servers are located. In addition, we use  						firewalls to protect the servers from outside intrusion. Please be aware,  						however, that no security measures are guaranteed to protect against  						unauthorized access.

						<p class="bodytext">Please note that information submitted on the <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.com" target="_blank"> 							www.valuedopinions.com</a> site or otherwise sent to Research Now over the  						Internet may be transferred outside of the United States and outside of the  						European Economic Area (EEA), where data protection laws are not as strong as  						within these areas. Additionally, the United States does not place restrictions  						on the transfer of personal data outside of the United States. If you have any  						concerns in relation to such transfers, you should not use the Internet as a  						means of communication with Research Now. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><b>7. Children's Privacy</b> 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Research Now believes that it's especially important to protect children's  						privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with  						their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. Although  						Research Now is based in the United Kingdom, Research Now complies with the  						U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We do not seek  						to collect any personal information from children under 16 years of age. During  						the profile registration process, we collect birth date, and if an individual  						enters a birth date that indicates the individual is under 16, we block the  						registration and any personal information submitted by the individual is not  						saved in our database. From time to time, we may ask our adult survey  						respondents whether they have children residing with them who might have  						certain interests, such as favorite movies or music. In such event, we do not  						ask the child or parent to submit personally identifiable information about the  						child. 					
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about  						your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed  						from our database, please see the "5. Accessing the Personal Information  							You've Provided" section of this policy.
