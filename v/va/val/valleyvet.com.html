		<li>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Other Promotions.  We may collect information about you when you participate in a promotion that we sponsor, such as a contest or sweepstakes (which we may sponsor alone, or co-sponsor with one or more third parties).  To participate in one of our promotions, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, mailing address, and other contact information.  For some promotions, we may request other information about you as well.  Your participation will be subject to the official rules of the promotion, as well as this privacy policy, and the privacy policy of any co-sponsor.</li>
		<li>Interactive Forums.  You and other users may be allowed to post comments and other content on certain portions of the Site, such as on a discussion board, blog, or other interactive forum.  We may collect any information that you or another user posts about you on the Site-including personal information about you-and it may be available to all users who have access to the Site.  Please keep this in mind when considering what information to post to the Site.</li>
		<li>Social Networking Activities.  The Site may include the ability for you and other users to link to one or more social networking platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter).  We may receive information about you when you choose to post or otherwise share information about us on any of these social networking platforms.  Any information that you or others post to a social networking platform will be accessible by any users of the platform, subject to its terms of service and privacy policy.</li>
		<li>Social Sign-In.  The Site may incorporate functionality enabling you to sign-on using your login information from a social networking platform, in lieu of creating a new login account specifically for the Site.  If we incorporate such functionality and you use it to sign into the Site, we may collect information about you from the social networking platform, such as your list of friends, "likes," and interests, as well as your contact information.</li>
		<li>Usage Data.  When you use or access the Site, we may collect certain usage data generated by your activities on the Site, including your purchasing history, credit card chargeback data, pages viewed, number of bytes transferred, hyperlinks clicked, and other actions you take on the Site.  The Site may also track the URL that you visit before you come to the Site, the URL that you go to next, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address or mobile device identifier.</li>
		<li>Location and Device Data.  We collect information about your location, such as the approximate location of your computer, phone, or other device (geolocation)from which you access the Site, as well as your IP address, and related data.  We may associate information we collect from your different devices, which helps us provide consistent services and experiences across your devices.  Some examples of the device information we collect are attributes such as the operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers; device locations, including geographic locations through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals; and connection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number, and IP address.</li>
		<li>Online Information-Gathering Tools.  We use cookies, mobile advertising                                              identifiers, web beacons, and other online information-gathering tools in connection with the Site-including Google advertising cookies and identifiers to enable the collection of Google Analytics data for web traffic on the Site.  These tools are intended to make using the Site easier in various ways, such as saving your preferences for you.  We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests.  If your browser is set to reject cookies, or if your browser notifies you that you are about to receive a cookie and you reject it, then your use of the Site may not be as efficient as if the cookies were enabled.  For example, if you have chosen to enable Google to associate your web and app browsing history with your Google account, and to use information from your Google account to personalize ads, Google will use data from you while signed-in to your Google account (personal information), together with Google Analytics advertising cookies and identifiers to tailor ads to your indicated preferences, across your devices.  We do not share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that can by itself be used to contact or identify you) with advertising measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission.  We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you.  You may <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">opt-out</a> of Google Analytics by following Google's <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">opt-out</a> instructions.</li>
		<li>Third-Party Integrated Services.  We may incorporate third-party ads and other third-party content on the Site, and integrate other third-party offerings into the Site, enabling certain such third parties to collect information about you or your online activities across other websites and, over time, through your use of the Site. For example, Google uses cookies to serve the Google Reviews badge on the Site, and to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site.  You may opt-out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to the Site by visiting the <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a>. Except as otherwise described in this privacy policy, any information collected through such integrated technologies is collected directly by these third parties for use by such third parties and other authorized parties, subject to the privacy policies of those other parties.</li>
		<li>Online Inquiries and Correspondence.  When you submit an inquiry or otherwise correspond through the Site, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, and other personal information to us.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We may keep the information we collect about you indefinitely.</p>

	<li>We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, and subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with the Site or our business.  We reserve the right to release information collected through the Site to law enforcement or other government officials, as we determine to be necessary or appropriate.</li>

<h3>Security Measures for Information We Collect</h3>
<p>To help protect the privacy of information we collect, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices.  In storing such information, we take commercially reasonable steps intended to protect such data against unauthorized access.  But please be aware that the Site is operated on software, hardware, and networks, and any component may experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control that may compromise the security of information collected about you.</p>
<p>Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure.  Thus, it may be possible for third parties not under Valley Vet's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through the Site or via email.  We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through the Site, but due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization.  Any such transmission of information about you to Valley Vet is at your own risk.</p>

<a name="header-5"></a>
<h3>How to Correct or Update Information We Have Collected About You</h3>
<p>You may correct or update information we have collected about you by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy, or, if available on the Site, by editing your information and preferences on your Account Information page on the Site.  You may also unsubscribe from any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements.  Also, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through the Site that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.</p>

<a name="header-6"></a>
<h3>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h3>

<h3>Transfer of Data from Outside the United States</h3>

<h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Sometimes we may share information collected about you with our affiliates and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information regarding the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties-within the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions.  All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at service@valleyvet.com.</p>
