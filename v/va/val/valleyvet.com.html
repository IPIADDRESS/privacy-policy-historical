		<li>Online Information-Gathering Tools.  As with most websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and other online information-gathering tools in connection with our Sites.

</p><ul class="default-list">
	<li>We may share the information collected about you within the Valley Vet family of companies-which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates, subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
	
	</li><li>We may disclose the information collected about you to our third-party contractors and partners in connection with their performing services or other activities in support of the Sites and our businesses, or their completing or confirming on our behalf a transaction or series of transactions that you conduct with us.
	
	</li><li>Information about you that is collected by third-party ads, content, or technologies integrated with any of our Sites may be disclosed to such third parties.
	
	</li><li>We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users of our Sites without restriction.  In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
	
	</li><li>We may disclose to one or more third parties the information collected about you as part of a merger, acquisition, or other sale or transfer of any of the assets or business of Valley Vet, or any of our affiliates.

	</li><li>We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, and subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with any of the Sites or our business.  We reserve the right to release information collected through any of the Sites to law enforcement or other government officials, as we determine to be necessary or appropriate.
	</li><li>We may also disclose information about you to third parties if needed to enforce any of the terms of use or other agreements for one of our Sites, or any investigation of potential violations of those agreements; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to protect against harm to any of the Sites; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others (for example, to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection).

<h3>Security Measures for Information Collected Through Our Sites</h3>
<p>To help protect the privacy of information collected through our Sites, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices.  In storing such information, we take commercially reasonable steps intended to protect such data against unauthorized access.  But please be aware that our Sites are operated on software, hardware, and networks, and any component may experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control that may compromise the security of information collected about you.</p>
<p>Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure.  Thus, it may be possible for third parties not under Valley Vet's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through one of our Sites or via email.  We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through our Sites, but due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization.  Any such transmission of information about you to Valley Vet is at your own risk.</p>

<a name="header-5"></a>
<h3>How to Correct or Update Information About You Collected Through Our Sites</h3>
<p>You may correct or update information collected about you through any of our Sites by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy, or, if available on a particular Site, by editing your information and preferences on your Account Information page on the Site.  You may also unsubscribe from any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible.</p>

<p>We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements.  Also, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through any of the Sites that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.</p>

<a name="header-6"></a>
<h3>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h3>
<p>Our Sites do not currently support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information.  Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set.  For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.</p>

<a name="header-7"></a>
<h3>Transfer of Data from Outside the United States</h3>
<p>If you use any of our Sites from outside the United States, information that we collect about you through the Site will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely.  By using the Sites, you consent to the transfer of data into the United States, and the processing of such data in the United States.</p>

<a name="header-8"></a>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>Our Sites are not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years of age (children).  We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites.  If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information.  If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy and request that we delete that information from our systems.</p>

<a name="header-9"></a>
<h3>Privacy Policies of any Linked Websites or Other Parties</h3>
<p>This privacy policy only addresses Valley Vet's practices for the personal and other information that we may obtain about you through any of the Sites, or through your other communications with Valley Vet.
