Research Now will observe the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) when it deals with your personal information. We value our panel members and recognise their right to keep their personal information private. This statement discloses our information collecting handling and disclosure practices in Australia and for the purposes of NPP 5.1. 
</p>

</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>We collect personal information from you when you communicate with us by any media. This includes whenever you complete a survey, send us an email, call us or send us a letter. The information we collect about you includes information about your views in respect of the subject matter of our surveys together with demographic information.

We may use your personal information ourselves to conduct direct marketing but you are entitled to opt out from receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time. You may do so on our website or by responding to the opt-out option which is included with each direct marketing communication that we send. <br><br><b>Anonymisation </b><br><br>Research Now conducts surveys on a variety of topics. Clients will give Research Now a brief setting out the types of individuals from whom we should seek answers. The brief will include matters such as age, ethnic background, qualifications and occupation. Research Now will review its database and then send out invites to an online survey to people falling within the client brief. Research Now provides clients with data files containing anonymous answers to survey questions. No personal information in respect of those individuals responding to a survey will be given to clients of Research Now. Research Now will, from time to time, assist research organisations in other jurisdictions to survey people in the countries in which it operates. In these circumstances it will either send you a survey to complete, the answers of which will be summarised, anonymised and sent to the client or they will prepare questions for you to answer directly. In such circumstances your personal information is not transferred to third parties. 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br><b>How we protect your personal information? </b>
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>Research Now takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure or loss. These steps include the use of encryption systems, passwords and firewalls. 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br><b>Disclosure of your personal information </b>
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>We do not pass on personal information to organisations for whom we do market research, whether for research or marketing purposes. However, we do pass on information collected during surveys in a de-identified aggregated form to assist our clients in better product offerings. We will not supply any sensitive information about you to any third party without your consent. Personal information may be shared between members of the group of companies of which Research Now is now a part. 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br><b>Export of personal information </b>
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>Information may be disclosed by Research Now to related companies in the United Kingdom. The collection and handling of personal information by our group of companies in the United Kingdom is subject to the Data Protection Act 1988 and we and our related companies will comply with that legislation when we deal with your personal information in the UK. Please see our website privacy policy at <a href="http://www.valuedopinions.co.uk" target="_blank">www.valuedopinions.co.uk</a>. Please note that information displayed on our website or sent to Research Now over the internet may be transferred outside a jurisdiction where data protection laws are not as strong as in Australia or the United Kingdom. If you have any concerns in relation to such transfers, you should not use the internet as a means of communication with Research Now. 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br><b>Monitoring of telephone calls and e-mail </b>
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>Your telephone calls and e-mails to us may be recorded and monitored for quality control purposes. We may also intercept communications made to individual members of staff at Research Now when this is required for business purposes 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br><b>Cookies </b>
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to the site. This can include using a 'cookie', pieces of information that are transferred to an individual user's hard drive for record keeping purposes. At the present time we send a basic cookie to your computer which stores basic information which you enter into the site, which may include your name, address, phone number and email address (Basic Cookies). 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The Basic Cookie functions by saving your passwords and site preferences. As a result it is possible to speed up your future activities at the site and allow Research Now to provide you with information specifically tailored to your interests. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. To modify your browser settings click on the help section of your Internet browser and follow the instructions. 
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>We also use an advanced cookie which incorporates a key which can identify tags contained in certain on-line advertisements relating to our clients and their products, services and other information (Advanced Cookies). If you click on an advertisement including the tag, the key will send Research Now an update confirming that you have linked to this advertisement. We use this information for the purposes specified above. We ensure that tags are not included in any advertisements which could provide information which amounts to sensitive personal data, for example information about your religious beliefs, your sexual life or your health.
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>In addition, we use Adobe Flash cookies in connection with our services on our website (Flash Cookies). Similar to basic and advanced cookies, Flash Cookies are used to remember settings, preferences and usage, but are managed through a different interface to the one provided by your web browser.&nbsp; We use Flash Cookies to detect fraudulent panel members, e.g., those who have duplicate accounts with Valued Opinions and those who sign up with the Australian Valued Opinions panel from other countries. If you want to delete Flash Cookies, please access your Flash Player settings management tool available on Adobe's web site. However, if you do not accept Flash Cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of our website or all functionality of our services.
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>In the event that we do collect any personal information about visitors to the site through cookies it is available only to Research Now.
</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><br>By deleting the advanced cookie and or Flash cookie you will still be able to participate in Valued Opinions surveys. However you will reduce your chances of receiving more tailored surveys and as a result lower your reward earning opportunities. <br><br>If you do not want to receive the Cookies, please click on the following link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2" target="_blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2</a> for instructions on how you can delete it from your computer.<br><br>
