              </b><br>
              Internet consumer privacy is of paramount importance to ValueClick, 
              our advertisers, and the Web publishers in our network. The following 
              statement outlines ValueClick's policies and principles regarding 
              online privacy. ValueClick, Inc. is committed to protecting the 
              privacy of consumers, publishers, and advertisers, and to do our 
              part to maintain the integrity of the Internet. <br>
              <br>
              Because of the changing nature of consumer needs and our business 
              itself, ValueClick, Inc. reserves the right to modify this policy 
              statement at any time without notice. As such, and since we want 
              to always make certain that our privacy policy is clearly understood, 
              <u>we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically 
              to note any changes that may have occurred</u>. Please forward any 
              comments you may have regarding this policy to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@valueclick.com">privacy@valueclick.com</a>.

              <b><br>
              </b><u> <b>Internet Consumer Data Collected by ValueClick, Inc's 
              Standard Delivery System. </b></u><br>
              <br>
              <b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) </b><br>
              When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served 
              advertisements (running through our network of websites), ValueClick, 
              Inc. does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding 
              the consumer who clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security 
              number, e-mail address). <br>
              <b><br>
              Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) </b><br>
              When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served 
              advertisements (running through our network of websites), ValueClick, 
              Inc. does collect what the industry terms as "ad delivery and reporting 
              data" (Type of Browser, Operating System, IP address, domain type, 
              page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet consumer has 
              responded to an advertisement). This type of information is defined 
              by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network Advertising Initiative 
              section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) 
              "ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data 
              can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore 
              it cannot be used for profiling purposes.<br>
              <br>
              ValueClick, Inc. retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, 
              for accounting and auditing purposes.. <br>
              <br>
              In addition ValueClick, Inc. does not collect any specific non-personally 
              identifiable information (e.g. age, gender, interests, income-range) 
              that could potentially be linked with other data to identify individual 
              Internet consumers for the purpose of profiling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>"Cookies"</b> <br>
              When an Internet consumer views a ValueClick, Inc. served banner 
              for the first time, a "cookie" is placed within their computer. 
              A "cookie" is a unique tag that is issued to the Internet customer 
              and is used to identify individual computers. The purpose of the 
              cookie is to allow the ad serving company to deliver advertisements 
              that have a greater degree of relevance to the consumer, even though 
              that consumer is, in essence, anonymous to the ad serving company. 
              Consumers who wish to remove this cookie and disable their web browser 
              from receiving further cookies can do so by following the opt-out 
              procedures found in the section immediately below. <br>
              <br>

              <br>
              <b>Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies - Remove and 
              Disable option</b><br>
              When a consumer views an ad served by ValueClick, Inc., they are 
              assigned a unique number, known as a cookie, which is recorded and 
              stored on their computer in their web browser's cookie file. Cookies 
              do not harm Internet consumer's computers. <br>
              <br>
              While cookies are not essential to ValueClick, Inc.'s continued 
              success, they do help us to reach several of our key goals, such 
              as providing Internet users with a more fulfilling, results oriented 
              experience on the web, reducing the repetition of advertising, and 
              increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by Internet consumers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Internet consumers have the option 
              of disabling cookies within their web browser software, which means 
              that they will no longer receive cookies without their approval. 
              Internet consumers can also delete any cookies that currently reside 
              on their computer. Internet consumers should refer to their respective 
              browser's user manual for instruction on performing this action. 
              It is important to note that disabling the cookie option in your 
              web browser will block your computer from receiving cookies from 
              all websites using this technology. <br>

              from our clients. Non-personally identifiable information is also

              <br>
              <b>Personally Identifiable Client Data </b><br>
              ValueClick, Inc. collects personally identifiable information from 
              all websites (and specifically their owners) wishing to join our 
              network. The collection of this information is a part of normal

              data. <br>
              <br>
              ValueClick, Inc. does not use any personally identifiable data about 
              a client for profiling purposes. All personally identifiable information 
              that ValueClick, Inc. collects from clients is principally intended 
              for administrative needs (e.g., accounting and pay-out), for which 
              purpose such data are required.<br>
              <br>
              Periodically ValueClick, Inc. may desire to communicate with our 
              network of hosts via email newsletters or other avenues to offer 
              strategic marketing information and other communications to assist 
              in business related activities. In such instances ValueClick, Inc. 
              will access clients' personally identifiable information. In the 
              event that a client of ValueClick, Inc. wishes not to have their 
              personally identifiable information used for the aforementioned 
              purposes, those clients can elect to opt-out. For more information 
              on opting-out please see the "Client Choice Concerning Data Collection" 
              section below. <br>
              <br>
              All personally identifiable data provided by individual clients 
              will be kept in strict confidence by ValueClick, Inc. and will be 
              treated with the same level of respect and care that ValueClick, 
              Inc. treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets. 
              ValueClick, Inc. will never sell, rent, exchange or barter any personally 
              identifiable information to or with any third party for financial 
              gain or marketing purposes. ValueClick, Inc. may, from time to time, 
              provide such information to certain third-party administrative vendors 
              for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such 
              as billing, delivery and payouts. Any third-party vendor so used, 
              will be required to enter into a confidentiality and non-disclosure 
              agreement with ValueClick, Inc. in accordance with the policies 
              stated here.<br>

              <br>
              <b>Personally Identifiable Client Data - Opt-Out </b><br>
              Because ValueClick, Inc. is a strong proponent of online privacy 
              we are committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is 
              provided to all clients before any personally identifiable data 
              are used for any purposes other than for what was originally intended. 
              <br>
              <br>
              When a client joins ValueClick, Inc.'s network and registers for 
              ValueClick, Inc.'s services, personally identifiable information 
              is required as a part of doing business. ValueClick, Inc.'s primary 
              intent in collecting personally identifiable information is for 
              use in administrative purposes including accounting and payouts. 
              However, ValueClick, Inc. may periodically use personally identifiable 
              information for marketing and communication purposes targeted to 
              our clients. Clients wishing not to receive such communications 
              from ValueClick, Inc. may do so by "opting-out" during the registration 
              and application procedure process. A client may change their "opt" 
              status at anytime during their tenure with ValueClick, Inc. by accessing 
              their online account. <br>

              ValueClick, Inc. makes every effort to maintain the security of 
              its network and the data we collect. Any data that is stored on 
              ValueClick, Inc.'s server is treated as proprietary and confidential 
              and is not available to the public. ValueClick, Inc. has a strict 
              internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of 
              customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees 
              or third parties who have a need to know such information for the 
              purpose of effectively delivering ValueClick, Inc. products and 
              services.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Access to Data </b><br>
              ValueClick, Inc. allows clients who have provided personally identifiable 
              data, access their data to ensure that it is correct and to make 
              any changes at anytime through their ValueClick customer online 
              account. <br>
