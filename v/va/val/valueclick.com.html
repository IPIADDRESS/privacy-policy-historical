policies and principles regarding online privacy. ValueClick, Inc. is committed 
to protecting the privacy of consumers, publishers, and advertisers, and to do 
our part to maintain the integrity of the Internet. <br>
<br>
Because of the changing nature of consumer needs and our business itself, ValueClick, 
Inc. reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time without notice. 
As such, and since we want to always make certain that our privacy policy is clearly 
understood, <u>we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically 
to note any changes that may have occurred</u>. Please forward any comments you 
may have regarding this policy to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@valueclick.com">privacy@valueclick.com</a>. 
<br>
<br>
<b><br>
CONSUMER PRIVACY</b><br>
ValueClick, Inc. serves advertising to websites using two different delivery methods; 
the first is through ValueClick's standard delivery system, the second using DoubleClick's 
DART delivery system. Internet consumers may encounter one or both advertising 
systems as they travel through the Internet. Each system has its own capabilities 
and purpose. Internet consumers should make note of both systems and the type 
of information each collects. <br>
<u><br>
<b>Internet Consumer Data Collected by ValueClick, Inc's Standard Delivery System. 
</b></u><br>
<br>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) </b><br>
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements 
originating from ValueClick's standard delivery system, ValueClick, Inc. <u>does 
not</u> collect any personally identifiable information regarding the consumer 
who clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address). 
<br>
<b><br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) </b><br>
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements 
originating from ValueClick's standard delivery system, ValueClick, Inc. <u>does</u> 
collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII), which is used solely 
for the purpose of delivering ads and reporting results. This is known in the 
industry as "ad delivery and reporting data". Ad delivery and reporting data includes 
type of browser, operating system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date 
and time of when an ad has been responded to. <br>
<br>
ValueClick does not use the collected NPII for any other purpose than to deliver 
ads and report results, and by itself this information cannot be used to identify 
any specific user. <br>
<br>
ValueClick, Inc. retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for 
accounting and auditing purposes. <br>
<br>
<u><b>Internet Consumer Data Collected by DoubleClick's DART Delivery System </b></u><br>
<br>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) </b><br>
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements 
originating from DoubleClick's DART delivery system, DART <u>does not</u> collect 
any personally identifiable information regarding the consumer who clicked on 
the ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address). <br>
<br>
<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) </b><br>
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements 
originating from DoubleClick's DART delivery system, DART <u>does</u> collect 
non-personally identifiable information (Non-PII). This information includes the 
type of browser, operating system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, and 
the date and time of when an Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement. 
<br>
<br>
Non-personally identifiable data is collected to assist in ad targeting and to 
measure ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers and web publishers who specifically 
request it. <br>

Because ValueClick only collects information for delivering and reporting advertising, 
consumers who wish to "opt-out" or refuse a ValueClick cookie being issued to 
their computer have the option of disabling cookies within their web browser software, 
which means that they will no longer receive cookies without their approval. Internet 
consumers can also delete any cookies that currently reside on their computer.

a DART cookie arrives at any subsequent website using DoubleClick's DART advertising 
delivering system, DART will recognize the previously issued cookie. <br>
<br>
Cookies are used by DART to record what advertising is interacted with so that

(and specifically their owners) wishing to join our network. The collection of
