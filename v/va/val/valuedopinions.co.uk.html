		<!--  Text: [begin] -->
			<p class="bodytext"><br><br>A cookie is simply a small text file containing information about the user that is placed by a Web site on the user's hard drive. Valued Opinions places persistent cookies on your computer when you complete the registration form or log into the Valued Opinions Web site, and places a session cookie on your computer while you are participating in a survey or viewing the Valued Opinions Web site without logging in. Persistent cookies are used to store your e-mail address and encrypted password. Valued Opinions uses this cookie to recognize you when you visit our Web site so that we may provide you with customized pages based on information in your Member account or profile. This cookie is also required to log in and view Member-specific information on the Web site. Valued Opinions uses session cookies to maintain your session state across user requests. This type of cookie is used to record when you complete a survey, how much of the survey you complete, the country you are viewing and what language you are using to view the Web site. We may also use cookies to track certain information about you based upon your activity on our site or on a third party's site. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use this information to conduct internal research on our Members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our Members. We do not associate information stored in our cookies to personally identifiable information you submit to us while using the Valued Opinions Web site. Valued Opinions occasionally utilizes e-mail Web beacons to monitor e-mail deliverability. We reserve the right to share this information in an anonymous singular summary and aggregate form with third parties. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">From time to time, we may allow a third-party media service to display content on our site. These third-party media services may use cookies within their content, but we have no access to or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by these third parties shall be governed by their respective privacy policies. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can refuse to accept cookies, free of charge, by adjusting the privacy settings of your Web browser software. However, if you do not allow cookies from Valued Opinions, you may not be able to use all of the features on this Web site.

<h3>Advanced Cookies </h3>
<p class="bodytext">The advanced cookie tracks the online patterns of Valued Opinions Members. The advanced cookie, which may be placed by Valued Opinions or in conjunction with a third party, incorporates a key which can identify tags contained in certain online content relating to our clients and their products and services. If an Valued Opinions Member views a page containing any content that includes the tag, the key will send Valued Opinions an update confirming that the Member has viewed the page containing this content. Certain Web pages or Web-based advertisements that you view may be tracked, and in some cases, this tracking data may be combined with survey answers that you provide. For example, when you visit or click on our third-party marketing and reward partners' Web sites or online advertisements these events are recorded by one of our technology partners, which in turn reports the data to us. We provide that data directly, or combine it with&nbsp; the other information that you provide us with, such as your survey responses and demographic information (but not with your personally identifiable information), to provide market research analysis to our Rewards Partners and Marketing Partners, for example on the effectiveness of their Web sites and advertisements. You can opt out of our technology partners' own data collection and ad targeting here: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>; here: <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">http://aboutads.info/choices</a>&nbsp;or here <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste" target="_blank">http://preferences.truste.com/truste</a>. &nbsp;If you delete cookies on your browser after opting out, you will have to opt out again.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">You can opt out of the provision of such data from our data partners to us and out of receiving such advanced cookies on your computer via Valued Opinions by emailing us using the contact form on: <span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"><a href="../contact-information/">http://www.valuedopinions.co.uk/contact-information/.</a></span>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Of course, if a cookie is one that an Valued Opinions Member may receive from a third party, regardless of the Member's participation in the Valued Opinions, then opting out with Valued Opinions will not prevent the Member from receiving that third party's cookie. We neither have access to, nor control over, third-party cookies or how they may be used. Likewise, if the cookie is placed by a third party, we have no control over the nature of the content with which these tags are included. If you would like more information about third-party use of cookies and about your option not to accept these cookies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">click here</a>.
