We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Public Content.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Messaging.</b> The Site allows you to exchange messages with others using the messaging feature and email. We may store these messages in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Inviting Friends.</b> You can invite your friends to join the Site by providing their contact information, or by entering your log-in credentials to import your address book from other sites. We may store and use your friends’ contact information to invite them to join and connect with you on the Site. Your friends will always have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving further emails from us.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Third Party Services.</b> We allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, to share your selected Public Content with those services, and import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them on the Site. You can always opt out on your Vatsnew account page. Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of this Site. For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on Vatsnew. You can also further modify your privacy settings with those other services directly. For example, you can adjust your privacy setting on Facebook to prevent your Facebook friends from sharing information about you from their Facebook accounts with Vatsnew.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Activity and Log Data.</b> We automatically store information related to your use of the Site, such as the pages you view on the Site, your browser type, IP address, requested URL, browser language, referring URL, and the date and time of your visits.

			 </p><p><b>Cookies.</b> We send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely identify your browser and improve the quality of our service. “Cookies” refer to small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site may not work properly or at all. Our cookies are linked to your information, such as your name, email address and password. We enable some of our business partners to use cookies in conjunction with your use of the Site. We have no access to or control over the use of these cookies. These cookies collect information about your use of the Site, such as where you came from, which pages you visited within the Site, and possibly other sites you visit if those sites cooperate with the same third party, but do not collect your name, email address, contact information or other personally identifiable information that by itself would allow the third party to identify or contact you.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Feedback.</b>You should feel free to give us feedback, register a complaint, or ask questions about the Site. We may store your communications, including any personal information you include in them, so that we can effectively respond to you.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION:</b><br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Public Content.</b> If you post content for public view on the Site, we may distribute such Public Content to a wider audience by sharing it (or portions of it) with third parties so that they can publish it on their own websites and media platforms. We may ask them to credit you as the source of these contributions by including your account name and profile photo.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Third Party Service Providers.</b> We may use third parties to provide technical and customer support, perform tracking and reporting functions, conduct quality assurance testing, perform payment processing and provide other services in connection with the Site.

			 </p><p><b>Third Party Advertising.</b> Third parties serve some of the ads on the Site. We do not send any individualized personal information to them, but they may have access to information that they obtain through cookies or that you share with them yourself. Note that we do not rent, share, sell or trade personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>Aggregate Information.</b> We may share non-personal information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors.

			 </p><p><b>Business Transfers.</b> We may share your information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will require them to honor this Statement.

			 </p><p><b>Investigations.</b> We reserve the right to investigate abuses on the Site, and enforce and apply our Terms of Service and Statement.

			 </p><p><b>SECURITY</b><br><br>
			 </p><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

			 </p><p><b>INTERNET BASED ADVERTISING</b><br><br>
			 </p><p>Google AdSense is used on Vatsnew.com.  Adsense serves ads based on the content of the sites you view.  As you browse websites that have partnered with Google or Google sites, such as YouTube, Google may place a cookie in your browser to track the types of pages visited or content that you viewed. Based on this information, Google associates your browser with relevant interest categories and uses these categories to show interest-based ads. For example, if you frequently visit travel websites, Google may show more ads related to travel.  Google will not associate sensitive interest categories with your browser (such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories), and will not use such categories when showing you interest-based ads.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>How do I opt out of interest-based advertising?</b>If you prefer not to receive interest-based advertising, you can click the “Opt out” button at the top of this page, or click on the “Opt out” button on the Google Ads Preferences Manager Page. Google also offers a number of options to permanently save your opt-out settings in your browser. After you opt out, Google will not collect interest category information and you will not receive interest-based ads.<br><br>
			 </p><p><b>DoubleClick DART Cookie</b> Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on Vatsnew.com.
