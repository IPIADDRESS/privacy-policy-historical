    <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong> </p>
    <p><br>
    Vator.tv respects your  privacy. The Privacy Notice below details the measures taken by Vator.tv to  protect your privacy in connection with your use of www.vator.tv and other  websites owned by Vator.tv. Vator.tv provides this Privacy Notice to help you  make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Vator.tv's  Sites. Your use of the Vator.tv Sites and any personal information you provide  on the Vator.tv Sites remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and  our Terms of Use. <strong>If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy or the Terms of Use,  please do not provide Vator.tv with any information and do not use </strong><strong>Vator.tvâ€™s Site. Your continued use of the Sites after the privacy policy has  been modified will signify your acceptance of the changes for information  gathered after the date of the change.</strong> Please note that any video,  image, or other content posted at the direction of Users onto the Vator.tv Sites  becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable  information subject to this Privacy Notice.</p>
 
<br>
This Privacy Notice  discloses our privacy practices including the notification of:
<ul>
	 <li>	Personally identifiable information ("PII") collected through our Sites; </li>
     <li>	Intended usage of this PII; </li>     
     <li>	The circumstances under which we disclose PII;</li>
     <li>	Choices available regarding opt-in/opt-out, data collection, use and distribution of the information;</li>
     <li>	Security measures to protect the loss or misuse of information under Vator.tv's control;</li>
     <li>	How to maintain the accuracy of your information.</li>
     </ul>
	 <strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong>
    <ul>
		<li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> You provide certain personally identifiable  information (such as your name, contact information, other PII and other  information volunteered by you) to Vator.tv when choosing to  participate in various activities on the Vator.tv Sites such as uploading  videos or other media files, posting messages in our forums or in the video  comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of  promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other  mailing lists. If you upload content to the Vator.tv Website, the content will  be governed by the Terms of Use and any other terms or conditions on the upload  pages.</li>
      	<li><strong>Vator.tv Cookies:</strong> When you visit the Vator.tv Website, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string  of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your  browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user  preferences and tracking user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to  accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Vator.tv features and services may not function properly if your cookies are  disabled. We use cookies for many purposes such as to save your password so you  don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We also use cookies to  deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your  interests. Vator.tv may set and access Vator.tv "cookies" on your computer. Vator.tv lets other companies that  show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your  computer. Vator.tv uses both session cookies and persistent  cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent  cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file  directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your  browser. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Vator.tv's cookies. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their  own privacy policies, not this one. Vator.tv has no control over the  information collected from or about you by any third party after you have left  the Vator.tv Sites.</li>
      	<li><strong>Log Information:</strong> When you use the Vator.tv Sites, our servers  automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit any  website. These server logs may include information such as your web request,  Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language,  referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names,  landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time  spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more  cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
      	<li><strong>Clear GIFs Information:</strong> When you use the Vator.tv Sites, we may employ  "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online  usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable  manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to  our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.</li>
      	<li><strong>User communications</strong> - When you send email or other communication to  Vator.tv, we may retain those communications in order to  process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>
      	<li><strong>Third-party Advertisers,  Links to Other Sites</strong> - This Privacy Policy  applies to websites and services that are owned and operated by Vator.tv. By clicking on links to other websites, advertisers and other third  parties, you are leaving the Site. Once you have left the Vator.tv Sites, Vator.tv does not control the data collection and  privacy practices, or other activities, of any third party linked to this Site  and Vator.tv assumes no liability and is not responsible for  any practices of such third party websites. Vator.tv allows other companies,  called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within  the Vator.tv Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad  networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements  and links that appear on the Vator.tv Sites. They automatically receive your IP  address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as  cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their  advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Vator.tv does not provide any personally identifiable information to these  third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of  a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or  opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Vator.tv to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages  18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain  channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or  ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are  trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these  third-party ad servers or ad networks. Vator.tv's privacy policy does not  apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or  web sites.</li>
  </ul>
<strong> HOW WE USE INFORMATION </strong>
      <ul>
	  	<li>If you submit personally  identifiable information to us through the Vator.tv Sites, then we use your  personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and  functionality of the Vator.tv. Vator.tv may combine information  about you that we have with information we obtain from business associates or  otherwise. Without limitation, information collected, including PII, may be  used by Vator.tv for internal research purposes, marketing,  promotions and public relations, subject only to the terms of our privacy  policy.</li>
      	<li>Vator.tv will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise  communicate your PII to any third party, other than Vator.tv 's subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of (i) their employees or (ii)  vendors and contractors operating under confidentiality agreements and subject  to Vator.tv's privacy policy, unless you give Vator.tv permission to do so, except as set forth in this privacy policy.</li>
      	<li>Any personal information or  video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in  messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes  publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name  (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or  send messages through the Vator.tv Sites and other Users can contact you through  messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the Vator.tv Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels,  and may be viewed by the general public.</li>
      	<li>We do not use your email  address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or  marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program  or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may,  however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or  administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Vator.tv Site changes or for customer service purposes).</li>
      	<li>We use both your personally  identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information  (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,  clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Vator.tv Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and  services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.</li>
      	<li>We use cookies, clear gifs,  and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have  to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Vator.tv Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c)  monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate  metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track  your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</li>
      </ul>
<strong>WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION</strong>
      <ul>
	  <li>We provide personally  identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our  subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the  purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these  parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy  policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information  and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
      <li>We do not share your  personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other,  third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent  or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the  ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li>
      <li>We do share  non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data,  referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with  interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for  certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on  the Vator.tv Sites.</li>
      <li>We may release personally  identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if  required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is  necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or  respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant ("Mandatory  Disclosures").</li>
      <li>Vator.tv also reserves the right to disclose personally  identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Vator.tv believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions  against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party  claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect  the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property,  or personal safety of Vator.tv, our Users or others ("Mandatory  Disclosures"). </li>
      <li>As we develop our business,  we may buy or sell assets or change our name or form of entity, and, depending  upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred  assets; provided, however, we will not sell or transfer PII except subject to  the terms of our privacy policy. For instance, in the event that Vator.tv is acquired by another company, your PII may be part of the assets  transferred to the acquiring party. The collected information may be provided  in the aggregate to third parties, including potential business partners and  advertisers, but this information is not linked to any PII before it is  disclosed unless Vator.tv has obtained your consent. In the unlikely  event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or  assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or  equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able  to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</li>
      </ul>
<strong> YOUR CHOICES/CONSENT/OPT-OUT</strong><br><br>
