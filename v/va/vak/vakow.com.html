	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1><br>
	
<div class="faq">

<p>This policy describes the ways we collect, store, use and protect the personal information of the users of our website, located at www.vakow.com ("Site") or when they access our service through phone, IM, or email. You accepted this policy when you signed up or subscribed to our Service. We may amend this policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with 30 days' prior notice by posting notice of the change on the "Policy Updates" page of our website.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vakow.com">privacy@vakow.com</a>. </p>

<p><strong>How we collect information about you</strong></p> 
<p>When you visit www.vakow.com "website", we collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. </p>
<p>If you register with us, you'll be asked to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This may include your username, password, location, date of birth, phone number, email address and other similar information.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we may ask you to provide your full name, photo, your URL, bio, interests and other such things. Though optional, this information may help you better identify yourself and find new friends and opportunities through Vakow!.</p>
<p>Some of your personal information (username, photo, location etc.) may be visible to others depending on your privacy settings. If you subscribe to a user or a tag and you're not a registered member, we will store your phone number and information that we may ask you on phone.</p>
<p>Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to you when you contact our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey. </p>
<p><strong>How we use cookies </strong></p>
<p>When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer. </p>
<p>We send a "session cookie" to your computer when you log in to your account. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect. </p>
<p>We also use longer-lasting cookies to display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account. </p>
<p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. </p>

<p><strong>How we protect and store personal information </strong></p>
<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.</p>
<p>We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. </p>
<p>Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time By using this site, you agree that we will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. </p>
<p>For any additional information about the security measures we use at Vakow!, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vakow.com">privacy@vakow.com</a> </p>

</p></li></ul>

<li><p>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, technology services). Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit. </p></li>
<li><p>Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product. These financial institutions may only use this information to market Vakow! related products, unless you have given consent for other uses. </p></li>
<li><p>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by.
