							<p>
								Thank you for visiting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Web site and reviewing our Web Page Privacy Policy.&nbsp; VA applies leading privacy practices and adheres to data stewardship principles in managing our Web user data.&nbsp; The data stewardship principles guiding our efforts include the following goals:
							</p>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li class="va-list">protection of Web user privacy;</li>
								<li class="va-list">maintaining the confidentiality of Web user data; and</li>
								<li class="va-list">ensuring appropriate levels of security for Web user data.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This policy describes how VA applies these principles to the handling of personal information you  provide to us via a VA Web page and online forms.
							</p>
							<p>
								Personal information may include your name; email, home, and/or  business address; phone numbers; Social Security Number; or other information  that identifies you personally.
							</p>
							
							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Key_Features"></a>Key features of our privacy  policy include:</p>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li class="va-list">
									This General Web Page Privacy Policy ("General Policy") applies to all VA Web pages.  Some VA 
									Web pages may provide additional policy guidance on privacy practices that is compatible with this General 
									Policy.   These additional policy guidance documents are called "Limited Privacy Policies."  
									Please review any appropriate Limited Privacy Policy prior to submitting your information on any VA Web 
									page.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									We will not require you to register or provide personal information in order to visit our Web site.&nbsp; 
									However, certain pages or areas of our site may require you to register or provide personal information 
									before you will be granted access.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									VA does not collect personal information from Web users, unless the personal information is provided by 
									you.&nbsp; A Limited Privacy Policy will apply in each case where you may provide personal information to 
									VA through our Web site.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									We will never sell or rent your personal information to outside parties.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									We use Web analysis tools (e.g., cookies) for limited uses authorized in this policy.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									This General Privacy Policy and each Limited Privacy Policy promotes the privacy, confidentiality, 
									security, and responsible handling of any information collected by VA over the Web.
								</li>

							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Privacy_Act_Rights"></a>Privacy Act Rights</p>
							<p>
								VA follows the requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects your personal information that VA maintains 
								in “systems of records”.&nbsp; A system of records is a file, database, or  program from which 
								personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier.&nbsp; The Privacy Act provides a 
								number of protections for your personal information.&nbsp; These typically include how information is 
								collected, used, disclosed, stored, and disposed.&nbsp; Our System of Records Notices are available at: 
								<a href="http://www.rms.oit.va.gov/sor_records.asp" title="Department of Veterans Affairs  Privacy Act Systems of Records">Department of Veterans Affairs  Privacy Act Systems of Records</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								We will not disclose your personal information to third parties outside VA  without your consent, except to 
								facilitate the transaction, to act on your  behalf at your request, or as authorized by law.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we do collect personal information from you online, we will  tell you in advance in the Limited Privacy 
								Policy’s Privacy Act Statement.&nbsp; The Privacy Act Statement will contain any  additional privacy 
								policies that apply to the information collected on a particular VA Web page.&nbsp; The Web pages that collect 
								personal information will have a hyperlink to the Limited Privacy  Policy that applies to that particular Web 
								page.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will use your information to process requests for services or information.&nbsp; When VA collects information 
								from you, we will  reference the relevant authority in the appropriate Limited Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Providing 
								the information is generally voluntary, but if it is not  provided, we may not be able to process your transaction.
								&nbsp; When information is required to process your  request, we will advise you of this fact in the appropriate 
								Limited Privacy Policy.

							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Information_Collected_and_Stored_Automat"></a>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</p>
							<p>
								We automatically collect certain information about your visit to VA Web sites.&nbsp; We limit the data 
								collected to meet specific business needs and to protect your privacy.&nbsp; We may know what path(s) you 
								took on our Web sites, but we don’t know who you are.&nbsp; We do <span class="va-bold va-emphasis">not</span> use 
								this information to identify you personally without  your express consent and an authorized purpose.
							</p>
							<p>
								We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit to a VA Web site:
							</p>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li class="va-list">
									General log information—Examples of general log information include, but are not limited to: Internet 
									domain (for example, "xcompany.com" or "yourschool.edu"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; 
									operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you accessed our site; and the 
									pages that you visited.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									Referral and statistical information where we have links to or from the site you visited. &nbsp;Such data 
									may include aggregate data such as the number of offsite links occurring during a visit to a VA Web page.
									&nbsp; It may also include specific data, such as the identity of the site which you visited immediately 
									before or after our site.&nbsp; We do not use such data to identify you personally. 
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We use the general log information to help us make our Web sites  more useful to visitors.&nbsp; We use it to 
								learn about how locations on our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and how 
								we can enhance ease of use by ensuring our sites can interface with the types of technology our visitors use.
								&nbsp; We also use such statistics to tell us of any possible site performance problems.&nbsp; Except for 
								oversight, law enforcement investigations, or protection of the VA information technology infrastructure as 
								authorized by law, no other attempts are made to identify you or your usage habits.&nbsp;
							</p>
							<p>
								General logs are used for no other purposes than the purposes described above, and are scheduled for regular 
								destruction in accordance with General  Records Schedules published by the National Archives and Records 
								Administration  (NARA) and agency record control schedule requirements.

							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Use_of_Cookies"></a>Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies</p>
							<span class="va-bold">What  is a Cookie?</span>
							<p>
								When you visit certain Web sites, they send a small piece of  information called a “cookie” 
								to your computer along with the Web page. 
							</p>
							<p>There are two kinds of cookies.</p>
							<ul type="disc">
								<li class="va-list">
									A <span class="va-bold">Session Cookie</span> is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your 
									computer’s random access memory (RAM).&nbsp; A session cookie is destroyed as soon as you 
									close your browser.
								</li>
								<li class="va-list">
									A <span class="va-bold">Persistent Cookie</span> is a line of text that is saved to a file on your hard 
									drive and is called up the next time you visit that Web site.&nbsp; This lets the Web site remember 
									information about your previous visits and use of the Web site.&nbsp; Persistent cookies are generally 
									not used by VA or other Federal government Web sites, unless there is a compelling and authorized reason 
									for their use. &nbsp;<span class="va-bold">If any VA Web page uses a Persistent Cookie, then the 
									<span class="va-emphasis">Limited Privacy Policy </span>for that Web page will clearly state the 
									purpose and legal authority for such use.</span>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<a name="Session_Cookies"></a><span class="va-bold">We use Session Cookies in the following manner:</span><br>
							<p>
								Log-on and log-off process — you do not have to log-on and  register to browse our site.&nbsp; If you 
								decide to register with our site to use one of our online services, session  cookies help with the log-on and 
								log-off process.&nbsp; The cookies enable us to recognize your  log-on ID when you log on so that we do not 
								create a duplicate registration  record for you.
							</p>
							<p>
								Transactions and  site usability — we use Session Cookies to improve how you navigate through our Web 
								site and conduct transactions.&nbsp; Session Cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse 
								over several pages, or to store and enter information on a Web page so that you  do not have to reenter the 
								same information, repetitively.&nbsp; Session Cookies may also be used to collect  referral statistics when 
								you click on a link to or from a VA Web page.
							</p>

							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Online_Forms"></a>Information Collected from Online Forms</p>
							<p>
								Many of our programs and Web sites allow you to use online forms. &nbsp;We will use the information you 
								provide to respond to you or process a request.
							</p>
							<p>
								Please remember that many of these forms are sent via email and may not be  secure against interception 
								across the Internet.&nbsp; They may  also remain as a permanent, retrievable record with your Internet 
								Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; If your email communication or online form contains sensitive information, 
								or includes such information as your medical records, drug  prescriptions, bank account or social security 
								number, you should send it by U.S. mail, unless the Web site Limited Privacy Policy clearly indicates that 
								such communications are appropriately secured for transmission over the Internet. 
							</p>
							<div align="right" class="va-xsmall" style="padding-bottom:10px;"><a href="index.htm#top">top of page</a></div>
							
							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Information_Sharing"></a>Information Sharing</p>
							<p>
								We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside  marketers.&nbsp; Information 
								collected via VA  Web sites may be shared with employees, contractors, and other service  providers as necessary 
								to respond to a request, provide a service, or as  otherwise authorized by law.&nbsp; If  appropriate, additional 
								information regarding the use and disclosure of  information collected on specific Web pages will be posted in 
								the appropriate Limited  Privacy Policyfor that Web page.
							</p>
							<div align="right" class="va-xsmall" style="padding-bottom:10px;"><a href="index.htm#top">top of page</a></div>
							
							<p class="va-section-header"><a name="Security"></a>Security</p>
							<p>
								In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us over the Internet, and upon our 
								receipt, VA uses industry-standard encryption, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL).&nbsp; The connection icon 
								area on your browser will change to “HTTPS” instead of “HTTP” when this security feature 
								is invoked.&nbsp; Your browser may also display a lock symbol on the task bar at the bottom of your screen to 
								indicate this secure transmission is in place.&nbsp; You should refer to the instructions for your particular 
								Internet browser software to determine how to examine the security certificate from our Web site to verify the 
								security of the connection.
							</p>
							<p>
								For site security purposes and to ensure that VA Web sites remain available to all users, VA employs software 
								programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, 
								or otherwise cause damage.&nbsp; Except for oversight or authorized law enforcement investigations, no other 
								attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this 
								policy.
							</p>
							<p>
								Unauthorized attempts or acts to either (1) access, upload, change, or delete information on this system, 
								(2) modify this system, (3) deny access to this system, or (4) accrue resources for unauthorized use on this 
								system, are strictly prohibited and may be considered violations subject to criminal, civil, or administrative 
								penalties.
							</p>
							<p>
								VA takes the security of all personally identifiable information we maintain very seriously.&nbsp; We implement 
								various measures to protect the security and confidentiality of personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Such 
								measures include access controls designed to limit access to personally identifiable information to the extent 
								necessary to accomplish our mission.&nbsp; We also employ various security technologies to protect personally 
								identifiable information stored on our systems.&nbsp; We test our security measures periodically to ensure that 
								they remain operational.
