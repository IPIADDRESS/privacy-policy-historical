Information Use</h2><p class="paragraph">We may collect and store information about You when You use the Service. We use the information to fulfill Your requests, improve the Service’s quality, provide the Service’s functionality, personalize Your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third-party businesses listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message You, back up Our systems to allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations.<br><br>Among the information We collect, please note:<br><br><strong>(a) Account information:</strong>&nbsp;If You create an account with Us in order to take advantage of the full range of the Service offered by Vagaro, We may ask for and record Personal Information such as Your name, address, e-mail address, phone number(s) and other information You may provide with Your account, such as Your gender and birth date. Your name, as well as any photo You submit through the registration process, will be publicly displayed as part of Your account profile. We may use Your e-mail address or phone number(s) to send You updates and news, and contact You on behalf of other users of the Service (such as other users who send messages to You). You may choose to not receive communication of this type by accessing the “Account” tab on the Service and updating Your notification settings.<br><br><strong>(b) Submissions:</strong>&nbsp;We may store, use and publicly display Your submissions. When We display Your submissions, We do so together with Your account user name. The term “submissions” refers to the information that You submit or post to the Service for public display, such as ratings, reviews, photos, compliments and the information that You display as part of Your account profile. We may display Your submissions through the Service, share it with businesses, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third-party sites and services.<br><br><strong>(c) Contact:</strong>&nbsp;You can invite Your friends to join the Service by providing Us with their contact information, or by allowing Us to access Your contacts from Your computer, mobile device, or third-party sites to select which friends You want to invite. If You allow Us to access Your contacts, We may transmit that information to Vagaro long enough to process Your invitations.<br><br><strong>(d) Feedback:</strong>&nbsp;If You contact Us in order to provide feedback, register a complaint or ask a question, We may record additional Personal Information and other content that You provide in Your communication so that We can effectively respond to Your communication.<br><br><strong>(e) Personal Messaging:</strong>&nbsp;In order to allow You to send and receive personal messages to other registered Users of the Service, We record the messages that You send and receive using the Service’s personal messaging feature. We also record messages sent directly to Us.<br><br><strong>(f) Transactional Information:</strong>&nbsp;If You initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation, We may collect and store information about You, such as Your name, phone number, address, email, and credit card information, as well as any other information You provide to Us, in order to process Your transaction, send communications about them to You, and populate forms for future transactions. This information may be shared with third parties for the same purposes, such as the Business Account listed on Vagaro you are requesting a reservation. Vagaro does not disclose Your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their services to You unless You first agree to such disclosure. When You submit credit card numbers, We encrypt that information using industry standard technology. If You write reviews about businesses with which You transact through the Service, We may publicly display the fact that You transacted with those businesses. For example, if You make a hair cut reservation through the Service and write a review about Your experience, We may publicly display the fact that You made Your hair cut reservation through the Service.<br><br><strong>(g) Communications:</strong>&nbsp;When You sign up for an Account or use certain features, You are opting to receive messages from Vagaro businesses and Vagaro itself. You can manage some of Your messaging preferences, but note that You cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Vagaro. For example, if You make a reservation through the Service, We may send You messages about Your reservation using the contact information You provide, including SMS text messages to Your phone. We may also track Your actions in response to the messages You receive from Vagaro or through the Service, such as whether You deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages.
