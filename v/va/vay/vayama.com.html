<span style="text-decoration:underline; color:#553830;">From you. </span> <span style="color:#553830;">We receive and store information that you submit on our website or give us in other ways (such as via telephone or through the mail).  This consists of information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, date of birth, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date).  We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences (such as meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options) as well as your entertainment interests (such as tour itineraries, performance and activity interests, and venue preferences).  You can choose not to provide information to us, but generally this information is necessary for you to register as a user, make bookings for travel or entertainment, complete a profile, receive updates of flight delays or schedule changes, post reviews, contribute to a discussion forum, participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, ask us a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.  If you decline to supply or provide us with information while using our website, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of its features.</span>

<span style="text-decoration:underline; color:#553830;">About Travel Companions. </span><span style="color:#553830;">When you make a reservation on behalf of one or more travel or activity companions using our website, we will request personal information as well as interests, styles and preferences for each of those individuals.  You should obtain the consent of those individuals prior to submitting such information, as access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.</span>
