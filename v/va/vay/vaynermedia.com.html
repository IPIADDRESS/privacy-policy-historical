        <p><strong>This policy was last modified on January 28, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>The website you have entered (its sub-domains, affiliated websites, and any services available therefrom, including any mobile versions of the website or mobile applications) (the “Site”) is operated by VaynerX, LLC; VaynerMedia, LLC; and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates (“VaynerX,” “we” or “us”). We respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting data collected from you and about you. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we collect, use, share, and protect that data.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using the Site immediately. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Collection of Data&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us.</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal data from you in several different ways on the Site. Personal data means information that can reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, phone number, address, and email address). We collect this personal data when you voluntarily provide it to us (such as when you submit an inquiry or apply for a job online). You can choose not to provide the requested data, but you might not be able to take advantage of certain Site features.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. We automatically collect data about your browser or device and your use of the Site.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you access and use the Site, our technology and tools may automatically collect and record certain data (which does not identify you as an individual) about your use of the Site (your IP address, browser type, the make and model of device used to view the Site, unique device identifiers, the referring web page, pages visited, search terms and other information relating to your use of the Site, browser or device).</p>
<p>We also use various tracking technologies (such as cookies, clear GIFs, and/or pixel tags) to collect data about your use of and access to the Site. Cookies are small bits of information that may be placed on your computer by websites you visit, applications you use, or advertisements you view. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are. Pixel tags generate a generic notice of a visit to the Site. Pixel tags are used in conjunction with cookies to anonymously track the activity on the Site by a particular browser on a particular site.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Third-parties may also automatically collect data about you.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Some embedded content on the Site may be served by third-party content providers. Please note that these companies may also use cookies, pixels, tags or other similar technologies to collect data about you, both on the Site and throughout the Internet. Data collection and use by those third-parties is subject to the privacy policies of those third-parties.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Our “Do Not Track” (DNT) Policy</strong></p>
<p>Some websites have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. We do not currently respond to those signals or similar mechanism transmitted by web browsers. To learn more about browser tracking signals and DNT, please visit http://allaboutdnt.org.</p>

<p>As described above, we collect personal data about you when you voluntarily provide it to us, collect other data about you and your use of the Site automatically when you interact with us. If you do not want us to use your collected data as described above or if you wish to withdraw your consent to permit us to process your personal data, please email us at privacy@vaynermedia.com or write us at the address below with such request.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from VaynerX, you can opt-out from receiving such messages in the future by following the instructions in the emails or contacting us at privacy@vaynermedia.com.</p>
<p>With respect to the Site’s use of cookies, pixels, tags, and other similar technologies, by adjusting settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to be placed, and thus opt-out of certain features of the Site and the Site’s automatic collection of certain data about you.</p>
<p>You may remove certain tracking technologies and opt-out of online behavioral advertising messaging by using the opt-out tools available from the Digital Advertising Alliance (<u><a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices/">DAA Opt-Out Tool</a></u>) and the Network Advertising Initiative (<u><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/">NAI Opt-Out Tools</a></u>).

<p>You may also adjust your advertising preferences on various social media websites by adjusting your Settings on the platform (for example, you may adjust the types of Facebook ads you receive&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen">HERE</a></u>).</p>
<p><strong>8. Protection and Retention of Data</strong></p>
<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and to safeguard your data in our possession. However, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure and no security mechanism is impenetrable. Therefore, although we take steps to protect your data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data that we collect from you or the security of our servers or the Site. By accessing the Site, any transmission of data is at your own risk and you agree to assume all risk in connection with data sent to us or collected by us.</p>
<p>We retain data only as long as necessary in light of the reasons it was collected as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or until you inform us you wish to have your data deleted, whichever comes first. Please note that we may retain your data for longer periods of time as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or respond to governmental authorities.</p>
<p><strong>9. Foreign Jurisdictions; Personal Data Transfers</strong></p>
<p>The data that you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be collected, stored, and processed in a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that may not be subject to equivalent data protection laws, including the United States. We may transfer your personal data outside the EEA in order to store it and enable us to provide advertising, products or services to you. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, including the US, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards and ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this&nbsp;Privacy Policy. By using this Site and/or providing us with your personal data, you (a) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any personal data outside the EEA, including to the U.S., (b) acknowledge that U.S. law may not be equivalent to the data protection laws of your location and (c) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your personal data in accordance with this&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;Policy.</p>
