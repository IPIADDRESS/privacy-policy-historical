The personal data may for these purposes, be transferred internationally to affiliates of vanBasco.<br><br>Sometimes we invite visitors to submit names or e-mail addresses in connection with certain promotions, such as competitions or information on product updates. You may decide not to provide us with personal data which means you may be unable to participate in certain promotions, or receive product information, offered through the vanBasco website.

Based on your comments we may decide to improve the policy from time to time which will require an amendment to this statement. Future developments in the services which vanBasco offers and future developments in the law mean that vanBasco may need to amend its privacy policy.  In such cases, we will post an updated version of this privacy statement, which will become effective immediately upon its posting.<br><br><br><br></font></font></td></tr></tbody></table></body></html>
