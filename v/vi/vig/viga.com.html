we?</strong></p><p>Savanta Group Limited, registered in Scotland (SC 281 352) at the registered address 3 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7PE.</p><p>At Savanta we are committed to protecting the privacy of our website visitors, clients and, as a market research group, the privacy of research respondents. We want to provide a safe and secure service where we deal with your personal information. This means information that identifies you personally such as your name, photo, contact details, or data that can be linked with such information in order to identify you.</p><p><strong>Quick
Guide to Contents</strong></p><ul><li><strong>What personal information do we collect about you?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we use your personal information?</strong></li><li><strong>How long do we keep your personal information for?</strong></li><li><strong>Who do we share your personal information with?</strong></li><li><strong>What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request?</strong></li><li><strong>Do we make automated decisions concerning you?</strong></li><li><strong>Do we transfer your personal information outside the EEA?</strong></li><li><strong>What are your rights?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we contact you?</strong></li><li><strong>How do you contact us?</strong></li></ul><p><strong>What
personal information do we collect about you?</strong></p><p>We
collect and process your information in the following ways:</p><p><br> <strong>Information you give us</strong></p><p><em>If you’re
filling in the contact forms on our website</em></p><p>We will always ask for your consent when adding you to lists and you should know what you’re signing up for – be it, marketing mail or receiving content relevant to you from us.</p><p><em>If you’re
completing a survey or engaging in a questionnaire</em></p><p>We
collect information for market research purposes only.</p><p>The information you provide will normally be used to help a client better understand how well they’re doing in the marketplace, or to help them improve a service or similar. Data is presented back to our client in an aggregated, anonymised, format, unless you consent to us providing them your data with any contact information appended e.g. email address, phone number and so on. This would be freely given and not a requirement of conducting market research, unless the research required it for a specific lawful reason e.g. to pay you your incentive after completing the survey, or to conduct face-to-face research which you would opt-in to and so on.</p><p>If you’re signing up for our digital services (including as a user of one of our Vue platforms):</p><p>The
information you provide will be used to verify your identity when accessing our
digital services, to customize the services we provide to you and to assist you
in your use of our digital services. We will process such personal data in
accordance with this privacy policy in order to provide the digital services to
our clients (and you) and comply with the relevant contract between us and our
clients (and you).</p><p><br> <strong>Information we collect automatically</strong></p><p><em>If you’re
accessing one of our websites</em></p><p>We collect IP addresses of users of our websites and we may also store your browser’s environment variables (this is freely available when you browse the web and contains information like your operating system, the device you are on, the browser version and so on). This information is kept for security reasons to allow us to block fraudulent members of the public, but also to help improve your user experience when you visit our sites, for example serving up different web pages if you’re on a mobile vs. a tablet vs. a laptop.</p><p><br> <strong>Information we receive from third parties</strong></p><p>There
will be occasions where our clients request that we contact individuals on
their databases. This information may contain behaviour which our client may
have collected on you e.g. number of store visits, a loyalty band / tier, or an
internal value pertaining to the segment you are in. Upon completion of a
survey we may append some of this information on to the answers you have
provided to help our client better understand their customer database, and to
help us analyse the data more efficiently. Data is generally presented to our
client in an anonymised, aggregated, format and, unless the reward for
completing a survey requires it, or you opted in to do so, your participation
in the research will never be shared.</p><p>There may
also be instances where we have lawfully received your data from a sample
supplier that has lawfully collected your details and has the right to sell
this on. In these instances we would be contacting you as an unknown third
party, but the basis for processing is as per the above, only we would be
provided with far less information on you, for example just a name and email
address.</p><p><strong>How do we
use your personal information?</strong></p><p><strong>To
provide a requested service or carry out a contract with you.</strong><br> <em>for example, where you have entered a competition with us and we are
processing your personal data to deliver your prize.</em></p><p><strong>Where we
have your consent</strong><br> <em>If you have signed up with us for marketing, or to receive market research
surveys or services</em></p><p><strong>Where we
have a legitimate interest</strong><br> <em>If we have legally received your data from a third party for the purpose of
market research</em></p><p><strong>Where we
have a legal obligation</strong><br> <em>We may also store or use personal information where we have a legal
obligation to do so</em></p><p><strong>How long
do we keep your personal information for?</strong></p><p>We keep
your information for the following periods:</p><p>We have
our own retention policy for all types of personal data used throughout Savanta.
We will only keep data for as long as reasonably necessary.</p><p>For
example, we hold our client order information for 90 days following the end of
a contract unless a contract with our client specifies we must hold it for
longer.</p><p><strong>Who do we
share your personal information with?</strong></p><p>We share
your personal information with trusted third parties where we have retained
them to provide services that you or our clients have requested, such as
recruitment for qualitative work, face-to-face interviews, or other services we
are unable to provide in-house. While Savanta strive to carry out all functions
internally, there are instances where this simply isn’t feasible.</p><p>We share
your personal information with third parties who perform functions on our
behalf and who also provide services to us, such as professional advisors, IT
consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business
technology systems, research and mailing houses and function co-ordinators.</p><p>We share
your personal information with our other Group companies for internal reasons,
primarily for business and operational purposes. As we continue to develop our
business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or
merges with us your personal information will be disclosed to such entity.
Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganisation proceeding is brought by or against
us, all such information will be considered an asset of ours and as such it is
possible they will be sold or transferred to third parties.</p><p>Where
required we share your personal information with third parties to comply with a
legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that an applicable law requires
it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to
verify or enforce our Terms of Use <a href="https://savanta.com/terms-conditions/">https://savanta.com/terms-conditions/</a> or other applicable policies; to detect and protect against fraud, or any
technical or security vulnerabilities; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise
to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, visitors
to the our website, our business or the public.</p><p><strong>What
happens if you do not provide us with the information we request or ask that we
stop processing your information?</strong></p><p>If you do
not provide the personal information necessary, or withdraw your consent for
the processing of your personal information, where this information is
necessary for us to provide services to you, we will not be able to provide
these services to you.</p><p><strong>Do we
make automated decisions concerning you?</strong></p><p>We don’t
perform any automated decision making concerning clients, survey respondents or
website users.</p><p><strong>Do we use
Cookies to collect personal data on you?</strong></p><p>To
provide better service to you on our websites, we use cookies to collect your
personal data when you browse. See our cookie policy (<a href="https://www.savanta.com/cookies">https://www.savanta.com/cookies</a>)
for more details.</p><p><strong>Do we
transfer your personal information outside the EEA?</strong></p><p>All the
data you provide us sits on our secure servers in the EEA. However, as a global
company with offices in the USA your data may be transferred outside of the
EEA. In a scenario where your processing would be done outside of the EEA, we
will ensure that the transfer is lawful and that there are appropriate security
arrangements in place.</p><p><strong>What are
your rights?</strong></p><p>By law,
you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal information. Further
information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data
protection regulator in your country.</p><p><strong>Rights</strong></p><p><strong>What does
this mean?</strong></p><p><em>1. The
right to object to processing</em><br> You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing
for direct marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be contacted with potential
opportunities).</p><p><em>2. The
right to be informed</em><br> You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily
understandable information about how we use your information and your rights.
This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.</p><p><em>3. The
right of access</em><br> You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing
it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy
Policy).</p><p>This is
so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance
with data protection law.</p><p><em>4. The
right to rectification</em><br> You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or
incomplete.</p><p><em>5.&nbsp;The
right to erasure</em><br> This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables
you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no
compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to
erasure; there are exceptions.</p><p><em>6. The
right to restrict processing</em><br> You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When
processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use
it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their
information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in
future.</p><p><em>7. The
right to data portability</em><br> You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal information for your own
purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a
new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information
easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting
its usability.</p><p><em>8. The
right to lodge a complaint</em><br> You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your
personal information with your national data protection regulator.</p><p><em>9. The
right to withdraw consent</em><br> If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal
information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although
if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal
information with your consent up to that point is unlawful). This includes your
right to withdraw consent to us using your personal information for marketing
purposes.</p><p>We
usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge
a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information
for:</p><ul><li>baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or</li><li>further copies of the same information.</li></ul><p>Alternatively,
we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.</p><p>Please
consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We’ll respond as soon
as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your
request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we’ll come
back to you and let you know.</p><p><strong>How will
we contact you?</strong></p><p>We may
contact you by phone, email or social media. If you prefer a particular contact
means over another, please just let us know.</p><p><strong>How can
you contact us?</strong></p><p>If you
have any enquires you can contact us at: dpo@Savanta.com or by writing to us
at:</p><p>Attn.
