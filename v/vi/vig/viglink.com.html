<h3>Last updated: January 7, 2010</h3>

<p class="intro">
  We understand your concern about how information about you is used and
  shared. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to let you know about our
  policy regarding information that is collected on our website located at
  <a href="http://www.viglink.com/">www.viglink.com</a> (the "Site") and
  through your use of our software (the "Software") and services (the
  "Services").
</p>

<h3>Information That You Give Us That is Covered by the Privacy Policy</h3>

<h4>Personal Data</h4>
<p>
  We collect personally identifiable data, such as your name, address,
  telephone number and email address when you voluntarily choose to register
  for use of the Software or Service and when you contact us with comments
  or inquiries. If you are publisher of a website and are registering to use
  the Software and Service, we may also collect your bank account and/or
  credit card information that you may provide to us upon request.
</p>

<h4>Passively Collected Information</h4>
<p>
  When you interact with us through the Site, we receive and store certain
  additional personally non-identifiable information. Such information,
  which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently
  be used to specifically identify you. Examples include IP addresses,
  browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data
  involving your use of the Site, the Software and/or the Services.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
  In operating the Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie
  is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the Site gives to
  your computer when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide
  additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more
  accurately.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, we may install the Software on third party websites. In doing
  so, the Software will place a cookie on the computers of users of those
  third party websites and will collect personally non-identifiable
  information about your browser and your activity at such websites.
</p>
<p>
  On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar.
  Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
  notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies
  off. Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse the Site;
  however certain areas and features of the Site, require your acceptance of
  cookies to work properly. If you choose to use cookies, we may collect
  personally identifiable information without your prior permission.
</p>

<h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>
  We use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is
  consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally
  identifiable data for a certain reason, we may use such information in
  connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, we
  will use the personally identifiable information provided by users of the
  Software in order to make payment of eligible commissions. We also use
  personally identifiable information and personally non-identifiable
  information collected through the Site and use of the Software and
  Services to help us improve the Site, Software and Services, and to better
  understand our users. If we intend on using any personally identifiable
  information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy,
  you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at
  which the personally identifiable information is collected.
</p>

<h3>Use of Personally Non-Identifiable Data</h3>
<p>
  We may use personally non-identifiable information and pool it with other
  information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the
  Site and users of the Software and Service, the number of visitors to each
  page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service
  providers. No personally identifiable information is available or used in
  this process.
</p>

<h3>Sharing Information</h3>
<p>
  We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information.
  We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with
  you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share
  personally identifiable information with certain third parties without
  notice to you including those set forth below:
</p>
<h4>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</h4>
<p>
  We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform
  certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information,
  maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments. When we
  employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide
  them with the information that they need to perform their specific
  function. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of
  such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us
  with designated services.
</p>
<h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
<p>
  We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by
  law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply
  with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property (c)
  act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the
  Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.
</p>
<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p>
  As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In
  the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or
  similar event, personally identifiable information may be part of the
  transferred assets.
</p>
<h4>Informal Notices and Bulletins</h4>
<p>
  Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, educational materials,
  marketing materials, or other information to you, and will use personally
  identifiable information to send such communications.
</p>

<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p>
  You can always choose not to provide personally identifiable information to
  us. However, doing so may prevent you from obtaining certain information or
  using certain areas of the Site, the Software and the Services.
</p>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p>
  We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
  If you are under 13, please do not give us any personally identifiable
  information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
  children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Privacy Policy by
  instructing their children to never provide personally identifiable
  information on the Internet without their permission. If you have reason to
  believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally
  identifiable information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
  delete that information from our databases.
</p>

<h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site,
  the Software and the Service. It does not apply to information collected by
  third party sites or products or services that may be accessible through the
  Site, the Software of the Services. We suggest that you contact those third
  parties directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection
  and distribution policies.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
  We take commercially reasonable steps designed to protect personally
  identifiable information and to protect such information from loss, misuse,
  and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no
  Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please
  keep this in mind when disclosing any personally identifiable information to
  us or to any other party via the Internet.
</p>

<h3>Other Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>
  We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and
  from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will
  revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If there
  are material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of any such
  modifications by posting a message on the Site. We encourage you to
  periodically review this Agreement to be informed of our privacy policies.
  Your continued use of the Site, the Software or the Services after any
  changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement
  with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>Access to Information</h3>

  To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and
  complete, please contact us as specified below. We will exercise
  commercially reasonable efforts to update or correct personally identifiable
  information in our possession that you have previously submitted to us.
