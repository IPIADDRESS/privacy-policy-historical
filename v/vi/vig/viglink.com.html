<h3>Sovrn Holdings, Inc. Services Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Posted Date:</strong> December 18th, 2020<br>
<strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1st, 2020</p>
<p>Sovrn Holdings, Inc. (“<strong>Sovrn</strong>” or “we”) provides this privacy policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>“) to describe our and our subsidiaries’ information practices for our Publishers and Consumers (together, “you”) who use the Sovrn Services. Capitalized terms are defined in this Privacy Policy. For information on our information practices for our websites offered to our Publishers, please see the Sovrn Website Privacy Policy and the Sovrn Commerce Website Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By using the Sovrn Services or submitting Personal Information through our Sovrn Services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the processing of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h5>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h5>
<p>Through the Sovrn Services including the Sovrn publisher platform and other Sovrn publisher tools and widgets, the Sovrn ad exchange, Sovrn header bidding, Sovrn video products, Sovrn analytics and data services, the Sovrn Commerce affiliate linking services, and other Sovrn products and services (together the “<strong>Sovrn Services</strong>“), we collect information about Publishers and Consumers. “<strong>Publishers</strong>” are websites or publications that use Sovrn Services, or natural persons who interact with Sovrn on behalf of such websites or publications. “<strong>Consumers</strong>” are individuals who visit our Publishers’ websites.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes Sovrn’s use of Personal Information and Other Information that we collect when you use the Sovrn Services. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number), any other data that is associated with the contact information, and/or information that uniquely and persistently identifies a browser or device such as an IP address, mobile advertising identifier, cookie identifier, or email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, or combination of information about a browser or device (such as IP address and browser type/settings). “Other Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information including aggregate or de-identified information.</p>
<p>We collect and use Personal Information and Other Information as described in this Privacy Policy from both Publishers and Consumers. The practices described in this policy apply to both Publisher and Consumer information unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>The Sovrn Services contain links to websites or content, including advertisements, operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.</p>
<h5>Information You Provide to Us</h5>
<p>The Personal Information we gather helps us provide the Sovrn Services and learn more about how you use Sovrn Services. You may choose to provide us with Personal Information by interacting with us. For example, if you sign up for a mailing list or otherwise request information, we collect your email address. When you contact us by sending us an email or providing other feedback, we will collect any information that is contained in your email or feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Information from Publishers:</strong> We collect additional Personal Information from Publishers. The Publisher registration process through Sovrn requires a valid email address and a username and password. For some of our Services, Publishers may register using an existing Google account. For Publishers who register through Google, we will receive your email address and profile information. We may also request information from you to support use of the Sovrn Services, such as the first and last name, bio, year of birth, telephone number, websites, software, mobile applications, log in IP addresses, physical address, zip code, and country of residence for the Publisher contact. We may collect information about the categories of content our Publishers typically make available to others on pages integrated with Sovrn Services and link this information to Personal Information provided for that account. For example, we categorize the types of content that Publishers make available. We collect payment information from Publishers who purchase Sovrn Services, including by participating in our advertising services. A Publisher may also choose to provide us with log-in credentials for accounts with third-party services such as online advertising providers, in order for Sovrn to provide services, such as reporting, based on information from those third-party services.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but this may limit the features of the Sovrn Services you are able to use.</p>
<h5>Information Collected Via Technology</h5>
<p>As you use the Sovrn Services as a Publisher or browse websites within the Sovrn Publisher network as a Consumer, certain information may also be collected passively (as described in this section), including your web viewing and search activities across unrelated websites, mobile application usage, browser agent, browser type, operating system, IP address (which may be used to generate your approximate geographic location), device type, mobile device identifiers, email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, use of ad blocking tools, information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, and information about the precise location of your device (if you have allowed a website to collect your location through your browser or have enabled location services on a mobile device). This information may be linked to Personal Information that identifies your browser or device, including through cookies.</p>
<p>Sovrn Commerce enables Publishers to add links on locations including, but not limited to, webpages, sites, software, social media, and mobile applications to merchant destinations. When a Consumer clicks through Sovrn Commerce affiliated links to a merchant destination and then makes a purchase or submits a lead, the Publisher that generated the traffic is paid a referral fee or commission.</p>
<p>The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies, scripts, web beacons and pixel tags. With each of these technologies, a small (text) file is placed by a web server on the device visiting the website or service, which can be read out during further use. For convenience, these techniques are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “<strong>cookies</strong>”.</p>
<h5>Sovrn may store cookies on your device:</h5>
<ul>
<li>For Publishers, to allow you to use our Sovrn Services, and access secure areas of the Sovrn Services. Without these cookies, it is not possible to load or offer key functionalities on our website, such as logging in to your account, displaying dynamic elements or uploading information.</li>
<li>For both Publishers and Consumers, for statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use and performance of our Sovrn Services and to do the same for our Publishers’ websites.</li>
<li>For Consumers, to support the Sovrn Services that are described in this policy, such as for our analytics and data services and to provide Consumers with interest-based advertising, including through Google’s Exchange Bidding service, and the ability to opt out of such advertising as further described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Sovrn Services may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). For more information about how cookies are used or what information we collect, please <a href="https://www.sovrn.com/about-our-cookies/">click here</a>.</p>
<h5>Information from Other Sources</h5>
<p>We may receive Other Information as well as Personal Information about you from other sources, and combine it with the information that we collect through the Sovrn Services. In addition to the types of information described above, this Personal Information may include, for example, mobile advertising identifiers, information about your activities across unrelated websites or mobile applications, demographic information, email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices, information about you from offline sources, and/or precise information about the past or present location of a mobile device. These sources may include information conveyed to us by telephone or fax, information that we receive from third-party data providers, or information provided to us by third parties in a Publisher network.</p>
<h5>For Consumers: Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out</h5>
<p>For our legitimate business interests, and with your consent where this is required, we may process and disclose your Personal Information for interest-based advertising as described in this section.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Sovrn’s Activities:</strong> Sovrn collects, uses, and discloses web viewing data, app usage data, and precise location data across non-affiliated sites and apps over time for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertising to this device or different devices. You can choose to opt out of Sovrn’s interest-based advertising activities on your device. If you choose to opt out, we will not collect, use, or transfer such data from or on the device that you opted out, for the purpose of interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from your browser for interest-based advertising purposes, you can visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.aboutads.info/</a> to learn more about interest-based advertising and to exercise your opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes, you can download the DAA’s AppChoices app from your device’s application store. If you opt out through AppChoices, we will not collect, use or transfer such data from or on that device for interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>When you use the opt-out tools above, your choice will be effective only on the browser or device where you exercised the choice. If you use a different device or browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based. It will be installed only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies, and if you delete this cookie then you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Even if you opt out on your browser or your mobile device, we may continue to collect, use and transfer such data for other purposes such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website, fraud prevention, improving site performance and other purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser. Even if you opt out, you still may receive advertising from the Sovrn Services when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services, but that advertising will not be targeted to you. If you opt out of Sovrn’s practices, you may also continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.</p>
<p><strong>Opting Out of Sovrn Commerce:</strong> If you want Sovrn Commerce to stop collecting or storing personal data about the websites you visit, the links you click, or the merchants you make purchases from, you can choose to opt-out out of Sovrn Commerce cookies using our <a href="https://www.viglink.com/opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opt-out page</a>. Opting out of Sovrn Commerce cookies means that Sovrn Commerce will stop placing cookies on your device when you browse Sovrn Commerce enabled websites and/or links. To honor your opt-out choice, we need to place a cookie on your device so that we know not to track your activity. Clearing your browser’s cache or cookies will remove this cookie, and you will be required to opt-out of tracking again. Similarly, if you access sites that use Sovrn Commerce from a different browser or device than the browser or device you opted out of tracking on, you will be required to opt-out again.</p>
<h5>Use of Personal Information</h5>

</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use of Other Information</h5>

<li><strong>Other Information:</strong> We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose in our discretion, to the extent permitted under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use or disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Data Retention</h5>
<p><strong>For Publishers:</strong> We will keep Publishers’ Personal Information for the length of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

<p>We may retain Other Information for our business purposes, in our discretion or as permitted by law.</p>
<h5>Publisher Choices</h5>
<p>Unsubscribe instructions will accompany each promotional email we send you. You can also contact us in order to change your preferences with respect to promotional emails (or other contacts if you are registered as a Publisher) by emailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@sovrn.com">marketing@sovrn.com</a>. We will send you messages related to our relationship or transactions with you. You may not opt-out of these communications, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account as discussed below.</p>
<p>For Consumers, please see above for information on opting out of Sovrn’s collection, use and transfer of data for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
<h5>For Publishers: Access and Changes to Your Personal Information</h5>
<p>Connected to the Sovrn Services, we store and may display some of the information entered upon creation of a Publisher account, such as username (or display name) and bio, as well as network of connections. In order to access and remove or modify this bio and display name, and/or other contact information that is not displayed, you may login to your Sovrn account, select the “Account” option, and edit the contact details. To prevent any other information from the account being displayed by the Sovrn Services, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:publishersupport@sovrn.com">publishersupport@sovrn.com</a> to deactivate your account.

<h5>Additional Rights for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)</h5>
<p>You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, to erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. As further detailed in other sections of this Privacy Policy, you may also have rights to object to some processing, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertisement, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. In some cases, you can exercise these rights through automated means. Where this is not possible you can contact us through our <a href="https://www.sovrn.com/your-data/">web form</a> or through the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” section later in this Privacy Policy. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p>Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.</p>
<h5>For Publishers: Nevada Privacy Rights</h5>
<p>Under Nevada law, Publishers who are Nevada residents may submit a request directing us not to make certain sales of personal information we maintain about them that is covered by Nevada law, if we make such sales in the future.</p>

<h3>Sovrn Holdings, Inc. Website Privacy Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Posted Date:</strong> December 18th, 2020<br>
<strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1st, 2020</p>
<p>Sovrn Holdings, Inc. (“<strong>Sovrn</strong>” or “we”) provides this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe our and our subsidiaries’ information practices related to the information we collect when individuals (“you”) visit our business website, https://www.sovrn.com/ (“Site”). Our Site is intended to be used by business customers—our information practices for business customers are distinct from our information practices for the services we provide. To learn about our information practices for our services, please see the Sovrn <a href="https://www.sovrn.com/privacy-policy/#pills-1">Services Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>By visiting or submitting Personal Information through the Site, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the processing of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h5>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h5>
<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number), any other data that is associated with the contact information, and/or information that identifies a browser or device such as an IP address, mobile advertising identifier, cookie identifier, email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, or combination of information about a browser or device (such as IP address and browser type/settings). “<strong>Other Information</strong>” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information including aggregate or de-identified information.</p>
<p>The Site contains links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.</p>
<h5>Information You Provide to Us</h5>
<p>The Personal Information we gather from you helps us provide the Site and learn more about how the Site is used. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily, such as your name and contact information.</p>
<p>For example, if you fill out a form on the Site or sign up for a newsletter, we collect your email address. When you contact us by sending us an email or providing other feedback, we will collect any information that is contained in your email or feedback.</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but this may limit the features of the Site you are able to use.</p>
<h5>Information Collected Via Technology</h5>
<p>As you use the Site, certain information may also be collected passively (as described in this section), including your web viewing and search activities, browser type, operating system, cookie identifiers, and IP address. This information may be linked to Personal Information that identifies your browser or device, including through cookies.</p>
<p>The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies, scripts, web beacons and pixel tags. With each of these technologies, a small (text) file is placed by a web server on the device visiting the website or service, which can be read out during further use. For convenience, these techniques are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “<strong>cookies</strong>”.</p>
<p>For example, Sovrn (or our third-party partners) may store cookies on your device:</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow you to navigate our website. These cookies allow us to load or offer key functionalities on our website, such as displaying dynamic elements or uploading information.</li>
<li>To provide you with social media and multimedia functionalities. Videos and other media often rely on cookies to function correctly. In addition, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter can use cookies to see if you are logged in and enable you to “like” content or send it to your friends. When you use these features, such third-party companies can collect information from you. Depending on your settings, these external parties may also use such information for advertising purposes. If you would like to know more about this, please refer to the respective privacy policies of these third parties.</li>
<li>For statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use and performance of the Site.</li>
<li>To provide interest-based advertising and the ability to opt out of such advertising as further described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Site may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). For more information about how cookies are used or what information is collected, please <a href="https://www.sovrn.com/about-our-cookies/">click here</a>.</p>
<h5>Information from Other Sources</h5>
<p>We may receive Other Information as well as Personal Information about you from other sources and combine it with the information collected through the Site.</p>
<p>Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising</p>
<p>We work with third parties that collect data about your use of the Site and other websites or online services over time for non-advertising purposes. For example, we use Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the Service and for analytics and marketing purposes. For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use the Service, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>. We also enable third-party partners to collect web viewing data on the Site for “interest-based advertising,” which is the process of showing you targeted ads on one or more devices that are more likely to be relevant to you based on inferences drawn from your Web viewing data collected across non-affiliated websites and online services, over time and across browsers and devices. These third-party partners may also use their own cookies to display and track their ads. To opt out of this type of advertising from companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance or European Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory programs, you can visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AboutAds</a> (for U.S. residents) or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a> (for UK and further EU residents). Sovrn adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with these activities.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any third-party ad partners. To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.</p>
