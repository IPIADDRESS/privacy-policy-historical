<p><strong>Additional information about International data transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission can decide that standard contractual clauses offer sufficient safeguards on data protection for the data to be transferred internationally.</p>
<p>It has so far issued two sets of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from data controllers in the EU to data controllers established outside the EU or European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>It has also issued one set of contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers&nbsp;in the EU to processors established outside the EU or EEA</p>
