	<p>Last Updated: November 8th, 2017</p>
	<p>ViraLightning.com strives  to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to  provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use  Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street  address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.  We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any  unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
	<p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
	<p>How  we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services  provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you  register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain  features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may  provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,  message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.  Like most Web sites, ViraLightning.com also collects information  automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be  transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your  Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and  hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may  store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter  that information each time you visit, or may control the number of  times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.  As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information  through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us  with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to  accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and  password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features  according to your preferences.</p>
	<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
	<p>Like  other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your  privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
	<p>Aggregated  Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be  used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to  help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are  visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated  Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and  business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
	<p>We  may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  ViraLightning.com to communicate with you about your registration and  customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy;  services and products offered by ViraLightning.com and other topics  we think you might find of interest.</p>
	<p>Personally  Identifiable Information collected by ViraLightning.com may also be  used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications  with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the  operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access  such information. We will use your information only as permitted by  law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our  business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or  businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the  transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably  required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts  you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we  deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you  with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
	<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
	<p>ViraLightning.com expects  its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our  users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners,  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through  our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and  practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to,  or view as part of a frame on a ViraLightning.com page, certain  content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,  through ViraLightning.com you may be introduced to, or be able to  access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes  offered by other parties. ViraLightning.com is not responsible for  the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the  applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing  information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
	<p>While  on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some  of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,  some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include  cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a  particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site  may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or  other technology to gather information. ViraLightning.com does not  control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting  information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such  third parties.</p>
	<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by  third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are  beyond the control of ViraLightning.com and this policy.</p>
	<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
	<p>ViraLightning.com does  not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information  from or about children under 13. If we discover we have received any  information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will  delete that information immediately. If you believe ViraLightning.com  has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at  the address listed below.</p>

	<p>ViraLightning.com reserves  the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page  periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the  posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be  used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the  information was collected.</p>
	<p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
	<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Minnesota law. If a  dispute arises from or related to this Agreement, we agree to first try  to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the  following location: Becker County, Minnesota. Any costs and fees other  than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally  by each of us.</p>
	<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution  through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding  arbitration at the following location: Becker County, Minnesota, under  the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration  Association, which can found at http://www.adr.org. Judgment upon the  award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court of  competent jurisdiction.</p>
