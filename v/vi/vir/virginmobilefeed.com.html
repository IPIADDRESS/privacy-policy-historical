                                <h4 id="vm_usa_privacy_policy">Virgin Mobile USA Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>At Virgin Mobile USA, L.P. ("Virgin Mobile," or "we," "us," "our") we understand that privacy is important, and we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and visitors to our websites at www.virginmobileusa.com, www.virginmobileusarecycle.com, http://studiov.virginmobileusa.com, www.homelessyouthamongus.com, and www.vmcustomerpulse.com (collectively, "our websites").
<br><br>
The following information is designed to help you better understand the information we gather from our websites, how we handle the information once we gather it, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct the information we gather on our websites.  Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to our websites and not to other companies' or organizations' services or websites to which we may link, even if they market our products or use the Virgin Mobile name.  By visiting our websites or using the services provided there, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
NOTE: Some of our websites and services may involve features or practices not common to our other websites or services.  You should carefully read this entire policy to understand the provisions applicable to our websites and services you are using.
</p>

<h4 id="what_information_do_we_collect">What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience.  This allows us to provide features that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience easier. 
</p>
<h5 id="aggregate_data" class="underline">Aggregate Data</h5>
<p>We gather certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to our websites. This information may include which URL you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your IP address. We use such data only in the aggregate. This collective data help us determine how much our customers use parts of our websites, and do internal research on our customers' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you.
<br><br>
This type of aggregated, non-personally identifiable information may also be collected and/or used by third parties that support our services. In addition, we aggregate data and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.  
</p>
<h5 id="personally_identifiable_information" class="underline">Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>Users are asked to provide certain information when they sign up for our services such as name, address, phone number, birth date, gender, credit card information, and email address (collectively "personally identifiable information").  The personally identifiable information collected from our customers during the registration process is used to manage each customer's account. We also seek such information to provide products and/or services that more closely reflect your preferences.  In addition, we may use such personally identifiable information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze website usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our website's content, layout and services. 
</p>
<h5 id="personal_id_for_your_account" class="underline">Personal Identification Number for Your Account</h5>
<p>To activate and manage your account and obtain access to certain services, we require you to provide a secret code (your "Account PIN"). When using your account or providing your Account PIN, you must provide accurate and complete information to Virgin Mobile.  You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account PIN and are solely responsible for any activity conducted using your Account PIN.  You agree not to use the account, customer name, or Account PIN of another customer at any time unless that customer is under 18 and you are the parent or guardian of that customer.
</p>
<h5 id="voluntary_surveys" class="underline">Voluntary Surveys</h5>
<p>We may periodically conduct surveys of our customers and/or users of our websites ("survey participants"). We encourage you to participate in these voluntary surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third-party.<br><br>
We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other survey participants to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third-party affiliates.
</p>
<h4 id="how_do_we_use_your_information">How Do We Use Your Information?</h4>
<p>Unless you specifically decline, we may use personally identifiable information to contact you and deliver information to you via your home phone, address, email, voice or text messages on your mobile phone if you are a Virgin Mobile customer.  We may also share personally identifiable information with certain third parties so that these third parties can share information with you about new products, services and promotions that we believe will interest you. By accepting this Privacy Policy or by purchasing or using our products or our jointly-branded products, you expressly agree to such usage and sharing of information.  In addition, Virgin Mobile may use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form for demographic marketing purposes, and may disclose this information to third parties, including advertisers.
<br><br>
If you are a Virgin Mobile customer, in certain special circumstances, we may contact you to deliver service-oriented messages, even if you have asked that we not contact you about special airtime events or promotions.  These messages will be limited and only for this purpose.
<br><br>
We may use third party service providers to facilitate our services, and therefore, we may provide some of your personally identifiable information directly to them.  In addition, we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Some examples include fulfilling orders, providing mobile content, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service.  These service providers have access to personally identifiable information and may use it as needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose, except that they may aggregate your personally identifiable information with similar information from other customers in a manner that does not personally identify you.
<br><br>
Virgin Mobile cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws, such as protecting intellectual property rights and preventing fraud.  We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, to respond to claims or legal process, to protect the property of Virgin Mobile or the safety of its employees or others, to investigate fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is or may be illegal or expose us or you to liability.
<br><br>
It is possible that Virgin Mobile or its partners could be acquired by or merged with another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that Virgin Mobile or its partners will share some or all of your personally identifiable information to continue to provide service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent that it occurs), and we will request that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy or notify you of any changes.
</p>

<h4 id="what_are_your_choices_about_your_privacy">What Are Your Choices About Your Privacy?</h4>

<p>If you are a Virgin Mobile customer, you may change the personal information you have elected to share with us. You also have choices in the types of communications you wish to receive from us.

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

<h4 id="what_is_our_policy_toward_children">What Is Our Policy Toward Children?</h4>
<p>Virgin Mobile is concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent and may limit participation in certain services we provide to individuals over 13 years of age. At various places on our websites, we may request that customers provide a year of birth. If a child under 13 responds to that request, we will direct him or her to have a parent or guardian call a live customer care agent at 1-888-322-1122, where a parent will be permitted to purchase a Virgin Mobile device, establish an account and activate the  on behalf of a child under 13. In these circumstances, activation can be made only by phone with a live customer care agent, and the account must be in the parent's name.   A customer must be 18 in order to establish an account for a contract phone.
<br><br>
If we become aware that a child under 13 has or has attempted to provide us with personally identifiable information, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has done this, he or she should contact the following customer care agent to remove this information:
