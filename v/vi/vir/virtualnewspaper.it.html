If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us at gdpr@miles33.co.uk.  9. Transfers outside of the European Economic Area Personal information in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal information in the same way. We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us provide our email, website, applications and services to you (for example, platform and payment providers who help us deliver our applications and services, or advertising or execute your payments) and this means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our applications, advertising and services to you. We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred outside of the EEA by our service providers and hosting providers, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. For example, we may share information with our group companies or affiliates based outside the EEA for the purposes envisaged by this Privacy Notice. All Miles 33 group companies are subject to Miles 33 group data protection policies designed to protect data in accordance with EU data protection laws. In each case, such transfers are made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulations or “GDPR”) and may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA. By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your information outside the EEA in the circumstances set out within this document. If you do not want your information to be transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website, applications or services or contact us at gdpr@miles33.co.uk.   10. Other sites and social media If you follow a link from our website, application or service to another site or service, this Privacy Notice will no longer apply. We are not responsible for the information handling practices of third party sites or services and we encourage you to read the privacy notices appearing on those sites or services. Our websites, applications or services may enable you to share information with social media sites or use social media sites to create your account or to connect your social media account. Those social media sites may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about you (for example any content you have viewed). You should be able to manage your privacy settings from within your own third party social media account(s) to manage what personal information you enable us to access from that account. 11.

We use cookies to help us provide you with a personalised service, and to help make our websites, applications and services better for you. Our cookies may be session cookies (temporary cookies that identify and track users within our websites, applications or services which are deleted when you close your browser or leave your session in the application or service) or persistent cookies (cookies which enable our websites, applications or services to “remember” who you are and to remember your preferences within our websites, applications or services and which will stay on your computer or device after you close your browser or leave your session in the application or service).

The General Data Protection Regulation GDPR (GDPR) is European Parliament legislation that'll be introduced in the UK on the 25th May 2018. The GDPR aims to make sure that organisations look after your information and are clear about what they're using it for. It'll also give you more control over how it's used. Why are we changing our Privacy Notice? We know the importance of keeping personal data safe and secure. And we appreciate that when you share your data with us, you trust us to look after it. So we've made a few changes to our Privacy Notice and reaffirmed our commitment to protect your rights and interests. (Don't worry, it's all good news.) What is a Data Controller? What is a Data Processor? The GDPR divides organisations processing personal data into “data controllers” and “data processors.”  A data controller determines the purposes and means of the data processing and tells the processor what to do with the data. A data processor processes personal data on behalf of the controller pursuant to the controller’s instructions.  Data controllers must comply with the GDPR’s principles, including transparency and lawfulness of the processing. Data processors must act pursuant to the controller’s instructions, secure the data, and help data controllers comply with the GDPR. Miles 33 is a Data Processor when it acts as a systems or service provider to our customers.  Our customers are data controllers for the data they maintain in our systems since they decide what data we process.   As a data processor, we are responsible for complying with our contractual obligations and instructions in our customer agreements, including assisting our customers to comply with their GDPR obligations, securing data, keeping records of how we process personal data on behalf of our customers, preparing to notify our customers in the event of a data breach, and co-operating with EU data protection authorities on request Miles 33 is a Data Controller for its employees and contractors Will Miles 33 be amending Customer Contracts? For those customers that have Data Processing clauses in their contracts with us, we will clarify, on an individual basis, whether these contracts need to be revised as a result of the new GDPR.","keywords":"Privacy","articleSection":"Privacy Notice and Cookies","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Name Last Name"},"dateCreated":"2015-03-02T19:41:19Z","dateModified":"2018-05-25T07:31:10Z","datePublished":"2015-03-02T19:46:0Z"}

<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you request a copy of your information you may be required to pay a statutory fee.</p>
<p>If we hold any information about you which is incorrect or if there are any changes to your details, please let us know so that we can keep our records accurate and up to date.</p>

We will do our best to protect your personal information but we cannot guarantee the security of your information which is transmitted to our website, applications or services or to other website, applications and services via an internet or similar connection.

<h2>9. Transfers outside of the European Economic Area</h2>
<p>Personal information in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal information in the same way. We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us provide our email, website, applications and services to you (for example, platform and payment providers who help us deliver our applications and services, or advertising or execute your payments) and this means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our applications, advertising and services to you.</p>
<p>We take steps to ensure that where your information is transferred outside of the EEA by our service&nbsp;providers and hosting providers, appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect that information in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations. For example, we may share information with our group companies or affiliates based outside the EEA for the purposes envisaged by this Privacy Notice. All Miles 33 group companies are subject to Miles 33 group data protection policies designed to protect data in accordance with EU data protection laws. In each case, such transfers are made in accordance with the requirements of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulations or “GDPR”) and may be based on the use of the European Commission’s Standard Model Clauses for transfers of personal data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer of your information outside the EEA in the circumstances set out within this document. If you do not want your information to be transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website, applications or services or contact us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@miles33.co.uk">gdpr@miles33.co.uk</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Other sites and social media</h2>
<p>If you follow a link from our website, application or service to another site or service, this Privacy Notice will no longer apply. We are not responsible for the information handling practices of third party sites or services and we encourage you to read the privacy notices appearing on those sites or services.</p>
<p>Our websites, applications or services may enable you to share information with social media sites or use social media sites to create your account or to connect your social media account. Those social media sites may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about you (for example any content you have viewed). You should be able to manage your privacy settings from within your own third party social media account(s) to manage what personal information you enable us to access from that account.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What is GDPR – how does it affect me?</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation GDPR&nbsp;(GDPR) is European Parliament legislation that'll be introduced in the UK on the 25th May 2018. The GDPR aims to make sure that organisations look after your information and are clear about what they're using it for. It'll also give you more control over how it's used.</p>
<h2>Why are we changing our Privacy Notice?</h2>
<p>We know the importance of keeping personal data safe and secure. And we appreciate that when you share your data with us, you trust us to look after it. So we've made a few changes to our Privacy Notice and reaffirmed our commitment to protect your rights and interests. (Don't worry, it's all good news.)</p>
<h2>What is a Data Controller? What is a Data Processor?</h2>
<p>The GDPR divides organisations processing personal data into “data controllers” and “data processors.”&nbsp; A data controller determines the purposes and means of the data processing and tells the processor what to do with the data. A data processor processes personal data on behalf of the controller pursuant to the controller’s instructions.&nbsp; Data controllers must comply with the GDPR’s principles, including transparency and lawfulness of the processing. Data processors must act pursuant to the controller’s instructions, secure the data, and help data controllers comply with the GDPR.</p>
<p>Miles 33 is a Data Processor when it acts as a systems or service provider to our customers. &nbsp;Our customers are data controllers for the data they maintain in our systems since they decide what data we process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a data processor, we are responsible for complying with our contractual obligations and instructions in our customer agreements, including assisting our customers to comply with their GDPR obligations, securing data, keeping records of how we process personal data on behalf of our customers, preparing to notify our customers in the event of a data breach, and co-operating with EU data protection authorities on request</p>
<p>Miles 33 is a Data Controller for its employees and contractors</p>
<h2>Will Miles 33 be amending Customer Contracts?</h2>
<p>For those customers that have Data Processing clauses in their contracts with us, we will clarify, on an individual basis, whether these contracts need to be revised as a result of the new GDPR.</p>
