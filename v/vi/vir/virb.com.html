                <p>Welcome to Virb.com (“Virb”), owned, produced and operated by Unborn Media, Inc. (“Unborn Media”) and, potentially, in part or in whole, by its parents, subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Unborn Companies”). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new products and services (“Products and Services”), including the addition of new properties shall be subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as the General Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and Conditions”).   By using Virb you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, whether or not you register as a listener (“Listener”).  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
                <p>Virb.com is a music-oriented content and information website that provides a service to musical artists and to record companies on behalf of musical artists (each an “Artist” and collectively “Artists”) to post information regarding themselves as well as musical content owned and/or created by them.  Virb members can view each others' profiles (“Profiles”), communicate with each other, share photos, post journals and comments, and describe their interests. Registered Users can change their Profile information at any time and can control how other Users and the service communicates with them.  Users and Artists are sometimes referred to hereinafter individually and collectively as “Users.” </p>
                <p>Virb cares about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@virb.com">privacy[at]Virb[dot]com</a>.</p>

                <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY Virb</h4>
                <p>Virb collects User submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age to authenticate Users, and to send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the Virb service, special events, contests and special offers. </p>

                <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Virb also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Users and other visitors to the site.  This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Virb will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.  This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
                <p>In addition Virb uses pixel tags — tiny graphic images — to tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site.  Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read.  And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we’re only sending messages that are of interest to our customers. Virb stores all of this information in a secure database.</p>
