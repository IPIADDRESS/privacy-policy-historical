  <div class="pageText">
    If you subscribe to any of our email newsletters, we will use your email 
    address to send the newsletter to you. Our newsletter is "Double Opt-in". 
    You can unsubscribe ("opt-out") at any time, in which case your email

    wish to receive our newsletter, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions 
    included at the end of every newsletter.

    Website Visitors
  </div>
  <div class="pageText">
    Like most website operators, VirtaPay collects non-personally-identifying 
    information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make 
    available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, 
    and the date and time of each browser request. Our purpose in collecting 
    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our 
    visitors use our website. From time to time, VirtaPay may release 
    non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing 
    a report on trends in the usage of our website.
    <br><br>
    VirtaPay also collects potentially personally-identifying information like 
    Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. VirtaPay does not use such information 
    to identify our visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, 
    other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses 
    personally-identifying information, as described below.
  </div>

  <div class="subHead">
    Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
  </div>
  <div class="pageText">
    Certain visitors to our website choose to interact in ways that require 
    VirtaPay to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type 
    of information that VirtaPay gathers depends on the nature of the 
    interaction. For example, visitors who join our email list provide an email 
    address. In each case, VirtaPay collects such information only insofar as is 
    necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's 
    interaction. VirtaPay does not disclose personally-identifying information 
    other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply 
    personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them 
    from engaging in certain website-related activities.

  <div class="subHead">
    Aggregated Statistics
  </div>
  <div class="pageText">
    VirtaPay may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our 
    website. However, VirtaPay does not disclose personally-identifying 
    information other than as described below.

    Protection of Personally-Identifying Information
  </div>
  <div class="pageText">
    VirtaPay discloses potentially personally-identifying and 
    personally-identifying information only to those of our employees, 
    contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that 
    information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services 
    available at our website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to 
    others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations 
    may be located outside of your home country; by using our website, you 
    consent to the transfer of such information to them. VirtaPay will not rent 
    or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying 
    information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors, and 
    affiliated organizations, as described above, VirtaPay discloses 
    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information 
    only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that 
    disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 
    VirtaPay, third parties, or the public at large. VirtaPay takes all 
    measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, 
    use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and 
    personally-identifying information.
