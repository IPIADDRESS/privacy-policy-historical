				<span id="lbTermsHTML"></span></p><p>Virgin HealthMiles, Inc. ("Virgin HealthMiles") is committed to protecting your 
	privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we can and cannot do with the 
	information we collect about you and what steps you can take to protect that 
	information.</p>
<p>To enable us to provide quality service to you, we need to keep personal 
	information about you, including information about your health, fitness and 
	related activities, your email address, and your credit card number ("Personal 
	Information"). This information will be collected through the Virgin HealthMiles 
	Health Zone kiosks as well as information you provide through our website. In 
	addition, we will collect non-personal information related to your use of our 
	website through the Internet (e.g., cookies).</p>
<p>The Personal Information we collect will be used to track your fitness progress, 
	determine your points for the reward program, as well as to provide you with 
	information that you may find helpful. Virgin HealthMiles staff may also have 
	access to your Personal Information so they may contact you regarding your 
	participation in a Virgin HealthMiles program.</p>
<p>You will have access to some of your Personal Information on the kiosks and all 
	your Personal Information via our website. If any of your Personal Information 
	is inaccurate or outdated, you can correct it at any time on the website.</p>
<p>Virgin HealthMiles will de-identify your information and disclose it in 
	combination with others' information in such a way that no one could trace the 
	information back to you directly (i.e. anonymous, aggregated data). This 
	anonymous, aggregated data may be shared with other organizations for research 
	purposes. You are welcome to request the names of such organizations from us.</p>
<p>If you became a member of Virgin HealthMiles through your employer's participation 
	in one of our programs, then we will supply your employer with the same 
	anonymous, aggregated data mentioned above. Your employer will not be able to 
	trace such information directly back to your identity. Your employer may use 
	this information to provide additional benefits, programs and services.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information will not be sold, divulged, or made available to any 
	third party without your permission except as set forth in this policy or when 
	Virgin HealthMiles has a legal duty to make the information available to a 
	legally authorized party. However, Virgin HealthMiles may sell your de-identified 
	Personal Information to third parties in the form of anonymous, aggregated 
	data. In the event that Virgin HealthMiles is obligated to disclose your Personal 
	Information pursuant to a legal or administrative proceeding you will be 
	notified of the order requiring such disclosure.</p>
<p>Should you decide to end your Virgin HealthMiles membership, we will de-identify 
	your Personal Information.</p>
<p>Virgin HealthMiles has taken responsible measures to ensure that no unauthorized 
	person can obtain access to your personal information. Among the security 
	measures taken is a login process requiring a password and username that you 
	select and a firewall protecting our hosting server. Virgin HealthMiles will 
	retain your password and username as part of your Personal Information, but 
	will not share this information with anyone. Please be advised that you are 
	responsible for keeping your password and user name confidential and secure 
	from unauthorized persons.</p>
<p>You give permission that if there is a change of ownership of Virgin HealthMiles 
	in the future, your Personal Information can be transferred to the new owner, 
	provided that the new owner will not, in any way, limit your rights and 
	obligations regarding the information as set out in this Privacy Policy, to the 
	extent such information has been collected in such transfer.</p>
