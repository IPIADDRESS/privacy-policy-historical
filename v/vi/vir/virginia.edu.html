        It is the policy of the University to respect the copyright protections

        to "fair use") or specific license.<br>
        <br>
        The software provided through the University for use by faculty, staff, 
        and students may be used only on computing equipment as specified in the 
        various software licenses. <br>
        <br>
        The University regards violation of this policy as a serious matter, and

        Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer 
        for viewing. In theory, the requested Web page and the routing information 
        could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested 
        page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. 
        Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your 
        request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps 
        us plan Web site improvements. Optional information enables us to provide 
        services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to 
        forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able 
        to do so, and also allows us to plan Web site improvements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="1">We may use 
        non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site 
        For example, we may report that <i>X </i>number of individuals visited 
        a certain area on our Web site, or that <i>Y</i> number of men and <i>Z</i> 
        number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose 
        anything that could be used to identify those individuals. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
        may keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the Web 
        page is transmitted, but we do not try to obtain any information to link 
        it to the individuals who browse our Web site However, on rare occasions 
        when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of access information 
        are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may 
        be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession 
        to law enforcement agencies. </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, any records in our 
        possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Request might be subject 
        to being inspected by or disclosed to members of the public for any purpose 
        they may desire. As indicated above, client information may be retained

        Similarly, we 
        use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order 
        or request only to complete that order or request. Again, we do not share

        complete that order or request. </font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="1"> We generally

      <p><font face="verdana, aria, helvetica" size="1">Finally, 
        we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided

        Consistent with University and state policy on the appropriate use 
        of equipment, the University’s Web site (signified by the address 
        "virginia.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses 
        assigned to the University of Virginia) cannot be used for commercial, 
        non-mission-related purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, 
        this means that advertising space cannot be sold at any level of the Web 
        site. Only under one of the limited circumstances below may a commercial 
        logo, link or other material appear, if judged by the University’s 
        Webmaster or, upon request, by the N-BIS editorial board, to be consistent 
        with the University’s mission and with established graphic and placement 
        standards for the page. (See <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/universityrelations/webguide/index.html">Guidelines 
        for Web design</a>.) For example, commercial logos or display material 
        may not be placed in the “banner” area, roughly the top quarter 
        of a page.</font></p>

        <li><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The logo

        <li><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The link

        <li><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Such

Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The University of Virginia Home Page (http://www.virginia.edu/) 
        is the official Internet site for the University of Virginia. The "official" 
        Home Page structure includes the Home Page, the blue button secondary 
        pages, the four special interest pages, and other sites integrated into 
        the Home Page structure (maps, calendars, search, Web site index, addresses). 
        Pages that replace or supplement existing Home Pages through new interactive 
        technologies (such as portals) are considered part of the Home Page structure.</font></p>

        </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The objective of the Home Page is to provide a point of entry 
        for the academic and public community to the University's officially recognized 
        information resources though links and navigational mechanisms and to 
        provide timely content and links to news and events of general interest 
        about the University of Virginia. The following audiences are especially 
        targeted: Students, Faculty and Staff, Prospective Students, Alumni and 
        Friends as well as the community and citizens of the Commonwealth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Responsibility</b></font><br>
        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
        University's Web site is produced by the Office of University Web Communications 
        in University Relations. The Webmaster, reporting through the University's 
        Network-Based Information Systems committee (<a href="http://www.itc.virginia.edu/oit/org/committees/nbis/gen_info.html">N-BIS</a>), 
        has the responsibility of defining the content, look, feel, interface, 
        links, information architecture and navigation of the University's official 
        Home Pages. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This is done 
        through a variety of guiding principles and policies approved by N-BIS. 
        N-BIS is appointed by the University-wide Committee on Information Technology 
        (UCIT) to serve as an editorial board overseeing the availability and 
        use of the Grounds-Wide Information System (GWIS), and specifically, the 
        Home Page. In general, N-BIS does not approve individual items in GWIS, 
        but it does: 1. Approve the awarding of a directory to and/or the linking 
        of a Home Page by organizations and individuals eligible to do so. 2. 
        Approve categories of information placed on GWIS. 3. Serve as an appeal 
        board for determining whether material placed on GWIS is or is not appropriate. 
        4. Serve as the first step in the appeal process regarding retention of 
        GWIS privileges. Decisions by the N-BIS editorial board to revoke access 
        to GWIS may be appealed to the Vice President and Chief Information Officer. 
        Students and student organizations are, in addition, subject to the Standards 
        of Conduct in their use of GWIS. </font></p>
