It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at info@viralwebtoday.com &nbsp; INFORMATION AND COLLECTION OF USE We collect personal information when you register with Viral Web Today, and when you subscribe and share Viral Web Today channels. Viral Web Today may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies such as Google, for the purpose of delivering personalized content. When you register we ask for information such as your name, gender, age and email address. Viral Web Today uses the information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for services, improve our services, contact you, and conduct research. You may set up a channel on Viral Web Today. &nbsp; INFORMATION SHARING We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or when we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. &nbsp; COOKIES We use cookies on Viral Web Today to track how users use our website. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a users computer for record-keeping purposes. We link some information we store in cookines to personal information you submit in order to deliver a better experience on the service. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you dont have to enter it more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers help file. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. These are non-personal information which includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically-collected data to personal information. &nbsp; BEHAVIORAL TARGETING / RE-TARGETING We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. &nbsp; CONTENT OF ITEMS The contents of any item that you post directly to the site, including any text, images and audio, are stored and maintained on our servers in order to publish these items and provide the Service. Your submitted content will be associated with your account. &nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. &nbsp; THIRD PARTY SITES This Policy only applies to the Viral Web Today website and services.

These are non-personal information which includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically-collected data to personal information. &nbsp; BEHAVIORAL TARGETING / RE-TARGETING We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites.

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.

Your submitted content will be associated with your account. &nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. &nbsp; THIRD PARTY SITES This Policy only applies to the Viral Web Today website and services.
