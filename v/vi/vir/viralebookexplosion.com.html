<p><span lang="EN-US">Last Updated: April 25, 2007</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">www.viralebookexplosion.com strives to offer its visitors
the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and
personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your
name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of
this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to
any unauthorized third party. Period."</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">How we gather information from users</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">How we collect and store information depends on the page
you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when
you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards
and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,
www.viralebookexplosion.com also collects information automatically and through
the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from
having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,
but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may
be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">What we do with the information we collect</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to
enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We
respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Aggregated Information (information that does not
personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from
other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages
are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information
may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again,
this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about
you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
www.viralebookexplosion.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
and products offered by www.viralebookexplosion.com and other topics we think
you might find of interest. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
www.viralebookexplosion.com may also be used for other purposes, including but
not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time
as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure
in such cases.</span></p>

<p><b><span lang="EN-US">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">www.viralebookexplosion.com expects its partners,
advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware,
however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates
and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own
privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your
visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a
www.viralebookexplosion.com page, certain content that is actually created or
hosted by a third party. Also, through www.viralebookexplosion.com you may be
introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests
or sweepstakes offered by other parties. www.viralebookexplosion.com is not
responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check
the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing
information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some
of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that
enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular
advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services
operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather
information. www.viralebookexplosion.com does not control the use of this
technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not
responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties
without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
www.viralebookexplosion.com and this policy.</span></p>
