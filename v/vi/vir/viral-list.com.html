<h2>Viral-List Privacy Policy</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">
  Welcome to Viral-List (the "Site"). <br>
  <br>
  We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, especially 
  when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with 
  respect to those users of the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting 
  business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use 
  of the various services offered by Viral-List (collectively, 
  "Services") ("Authorized Customers"). <br>
  <br>
  "Personally Identifiable Information" refers to any information that identifies 
  or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such 
  information pertains, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone 
  number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, 
  and credit card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not 
  include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without 
  identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected 
  to an identified individual. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">We may collect basic user 
  profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following 
  additional information from our Authorized Customers: the names, addresses, 
  phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size 
  of the business, and the nature and size of the advertising inventory that the 
  Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">We use Personally 
  Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service 
  offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests on the Site. We may email 
  Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling 
  opportunities on the Site or information related to the subject matter of the 
  Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors 
  and Authorized Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide 
  requested information. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Personally Identifiable 
  Information collected by Viral-List is securely stored and is not 
  accessible to third parties. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and 
  distribution of the information?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out 
  of receiving unsolicited information from or being contacted by us and/or our 
  vendors and affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by 
  contacting us at support@viral-list.com <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use 
  Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the 
  services they select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our 
  Authorized Customers. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does Viral-List use login information?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Viral-List uses login information, including, but not limited to, IP addresses, ISPs, and 
  browser types, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement 
  and use, and gather broad demographic information. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable 
  Information?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update 
  Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by 
  emailing us at support@viral-list.com <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected 
  by the Site?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to 
  delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's database 
  by contacting support@viral-list.com. However, because of backups and records 
  of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining 
  some residual information. An individual who requests to have Personally 
  Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally 
  deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable 
  Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">We will let our Visitors and 
  Authorized Customers know about changes to our privacy policy by posting such 
  changes on the Site. However, if we are changing our privacy policy in a manner 
  that might cause disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that a 
  Visitor or Authorized Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we 
  will contact such Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or 
  Authorized Customer to prevent such disclosure. <br>
