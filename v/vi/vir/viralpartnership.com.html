		ON THIS SITE, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION TO VIRAL MARKETING 
		MEDIA OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY 
		OF THE WEBSITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Changes to Privacy Policy:</b><br>
		<br>
		This Privacy Policy changes from time to time and changes are effective 
		upon posting. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review this 
		policy for updates and you are solely responsible to be aware of any 
		changes to this and all posted policies on this website. Viral Marketing 
		Media does not provide notices of any changes in any manner other than 
		by posting the changes at this website.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Information Collection, Use, and Dissemination practices:</b><br>
		<br>
		This policy applies to Viral Marketing Media's collection, use, storage 
		and disclosure of information by Viral Marketing Media on its, (a) 
		websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related 
		companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party 
		websites, and (c) to Viral Marketing Media's other information 
		collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties, 
		or the use of customer lists from third parties. Viral Marketing Media 
		is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices 
		of third party websites or applications.<br>
		<br>
		<b>1. Collection of Information.</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>1.1. User Direct Information: </b><br>
		<br>
		Each time you provide information to take advantage of a promotional 
		offer, enter to win a contest, enter to win a sweepstake, send us an 
		email, or otherwise transmit information via the site, Viral Marketing 
		Media may obtain and collect personally identifiable information 
		provided by you, including, but not limited to, your name, email 
		address, mailing address, social security number, credit card 
		information, and telephone number. You may also provide us with 
		information that, when combined with personally identifiable 
		information, provides us with a better idea of who you are, including 
		but not limited to your gender, birthday, marital status, and education 
		level (collectively referred to as "personal information"). If you 
		choose to access our website, use our services or purchase our products, 
		we may require you to provide personal information as indicated on the 
		forms throughout the site. <br>
		<br>
		<b>1.2. Survey Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media collects information from you when you voluntarily 
		complete a Viral Marketing Media survey, order form, or a registration 
		page either online by using the internet, offline by providing this 
		information through the mail, in person or using a telephone. This 
		information may be collected by surveys, order forms, or registration 
		pages operated by third parties. This method of collection is 
		collectively known as a “Survey.” In such Surveys, Viral Marketing Media 
		or a third party may ask you to provide personal identifiable 
		information including your name, email address, street address, zip 
		code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), 
		birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, 
		occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and 
		online interests, and such other information as may be requested from 
		time to time. Viral Marketing Media may also collect such information 
		concerning you from another source and uses that information in 
		combination with information provided from this website. Completing the 
		Surveys is completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to 
		provide Survey Information to Viral Marketing Media or a third party, 
		but you may receive incentives from Viral Marketing Media or a third 
		party in exchange for providing such information.<br>
		<br>
		<b>1.3. Third Party List Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media may collect information from you when you provide 
		information to a third party and Viral Marketing Media subsequently 
		purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the 
		third party. Such purchased information may include, but is not limited 
		to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone 
		numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, 
		salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of 
		employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as 
		the individual may have provided to the third party. When acquiring this 
		information, Viral Marketing Media seeks assurances from the third party 
		that it has a right to transfer the information to Viral Marketing Media 
		and that the third party has a right to provide offers from advertisers 
		to you included on the third party list.<br>
		<br>
		<b>1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		Other occasions when Viral Marketing Media obtains information from you 
		include (1) your claiming a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive 
		offered by Viral Marketing Media or by a third party, (2) your requests 
		for assistance through Viral Marketing Media's customer service 
		department, and (3) when you voluntarily subscribe to a Viral Marketing 
		Media service or newsletter.<br>
		<br>
		<b>1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to 
		associate certain Internet-related information about you with 
		information about you in its database. Additionally, Viral Marketing 
		Media may use other new and evolving sources of information in the 
		future.<br>
		<br>
		(a) Cookies:<br>
		<br>
		“Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may 
		write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer 
		about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in 
		tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content 
		you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, 
		cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your 
		preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return 
		visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical 
		information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on 
		your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of 
		access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not 
		function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to 
		accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is 
		set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In 
		order to use all of the features and functionality of Viral Marketing 
		Media’s websites, you need to accept cookies.<br>
		<br>
		(b) Web Beacons:<br>
		<br>
		A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image 
		on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user 
		identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired 
		information about an individual in a database. This allows Viral 
		Marketing Media to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are 
		used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to 
		determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to 
		using web beacons on web pages, Viral Marketing Media also uses web 
		beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Viral Marketing 
		Media's database.<br>
		<br>
		(c) IP Addresses:<br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media automatically tracks certain information based 
		upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do 
		internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to 
		better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This 
		information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this 
		URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL 
		is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP 
		address. Your Internet Protocol ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" 
		which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For 
		local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may 
		be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are 
		automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a 
		user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an 
		individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to 
		locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, 
		however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which 
		ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, 
		and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.<br>
		<br>
		(d) Computer Profiles:<br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media may also collect and accumulate other anonymous 
		data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience 
		of our visitors. For instance, Viral Marketing Media may accumulate 
		visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers 
		used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, 
		browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine 
		keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal 
		Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to 
		identify you.<br>
		<br>
		(e) Data Mining:<br>
		<br>
		Data Mining technology may be employed from time to time if used by a 
		Client of Viral Marketing Media.<br>
		<br>
		(f) New Technology:<br>
		<br>
		The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web 
		beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, Viral Marketing Media 
		strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates 
		regarding its use of new technology.<br>
		<br>
		<b>1.6. No Information Collected from Children:<br>
		</b><br>
		Viral Marketing Media will never knowingly collect any personal 
		information about children under the age of 18. If Viral Marketing Media 
		obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information 
		about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately 
		deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, 
		Viral Marketing Media has no such information to use or to disclose to 
		third parties. Viral Marketing Media has designed this policy in order 
		to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").<br>
		<br>
		<b>1.7. Credit Card Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media may, in certain instances, collect credit card 
		numbers and related information when an individual places an order from 
		Viral Marketing Media. When the credit card information is submitted to 
		Viral Marketing Media, such information is encrypted and is protected 
		with SSL encryption software. Viral Marketing Media will use the credit 
		card information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase 
		transaction, and the credit card information will be disclosed to third 
		parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2. Use of Individual Information.</b><br>
		<br>
		The following section describes how Viral Marketing Media uses personal 
		information. The uses described in these sections may change at any 
		time. Viral Marketing Media may also broaden its use of your personal 
		information. Viral Marketing Media may also use your personal 
		information to provide commercial promotional offers to individuals or 
		entities through, among other things, email advertising, telephone 
		marketing, direct mail marketing, banner advertising and package 
		stuffers.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2.1. Discretion to Use Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		The personal information collected on this site and by third parties 
		will be used to operate the site and to provide the services or products 
		or carry out the transactions you have requested or authorized. Viral 
		Marketing Media may change or broaden its use of your personal 
		information at any time. Viral Marketing Media may use your personal 
		information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of 
		email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online 
		banner advertising, and package stuffers, and other possible uses.<br>
		<br>
		VIRAL MARKETING MEDIA MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO 
		THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN ITS SOLE 
		DISCRETION.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2.2. Email:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media uses your personal information to provide 
		promotional offers by email to you. Viral Marketing Media may maintain 
		separate email lists for different purposes. If you wish to end your 
		email subscription from a particular list, you only need to press the 
		unsubscribe button on the mail message. To unsubscribe from all Viral 
		Marketing Media’s email lists, you must submit your email address at 
		http://www.unsubscribemeplease.com/. Such an unsubscribe request will 
		permanently delete your email from all lists used by Viral Marketing 
		Media. Because Viral Marketing Media only sends emails when you have 
		agreed to receive emails from Viral Marketing Media or you have agreed 
		to receive emails from third parties, statutes requiring certain 
		formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to email messages 
		sent by Viral Marketing Media. Email messages sent by Viral Marketing 
		Media, will contain an advertiser's name in the "From:" line but hitting 
		the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to Viral 
		Marketing Media. The "Subject:" line of a Viral Marketing Media email 
		messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to 
		Viral Marketing Media.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2.3. Profiling and Target Advertising:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media uses your information to make and improve profiles 
		of you and to track your online browsing habits and determine which 
		areas of Viral Marketing Media's websites are most frequently visited. 
		This information helps Viral Marketing Media to better understand your 
		interests so that it can target advertising and promotions to you. Viral 
		Marketing Media may, at its discretion, target advertising by using 
		email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of 
		communication to provide promotional offers.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2.4. Storage of Personal Information:</b><br>
		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media stores your information in a database on Viral 
		Marketing Media’s servers. Our servers have security measures (such as a 
		firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration 
		of the information under Viral Marketing Media's control. 
		Notwithstanding such measures, Viral Marketing Media cannot guarantee 
		that its security measures will prevent Viral Marketing Media computers 
		from being illegally accessed, and your information from being stolen or 
		altered.<br>
		<br>
		<b>3. Use of Personal Information.</b><br>

		<br>
		Viral Marketing Media will use or disclose your personal information in 
		response to subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to 
		otherwise establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
		claims or in the event you violate or breach an agreement with Viral 
		Marketing Media. Viral Marketing Media will use and disclose your 
		personal information if we believe you will harm the property or rights 
		of Viral Marketing Media, its owners, or those of Viral Marketing 
		Media's other customers. Finally, we will use or disclose your personal

		<br>
		<b>4.1. Advertiser cookies and web beacons:</b><br>
		<br>
		Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies who
