			<br>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				(last modified: July 20, 2011)<br>
				<br> Virgin Gaming recognizes that your privacy is serious
				business and we are committed to protecting your personal
				information. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information
				collected about you when you visit the VirginGaming.com website (the
				"Site"), how that information may be used, when it may be disclosed,
				how you can take steps to control the use and disclosure of your
				personal information, and how that information is protected by us.<br>
				<br> In this Privacy Policy, which is available via a link at the
				bottom of every page on the Site, "we", "us" and "our" means Virgin
				Gaming and its affiliates, including Intertaintech Corporation and
				Impact Entertainment LLC (collectively, "Virgin Gaming"). Any terms
				that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning
				given in the Terms and Conditions of service (the "T&amp;Cs") [link].<br>
				<br> This Privacy Policy applies to all "users" of the Site,
				including unregistered visitors and "members" who have registered
				and maintain an account on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not
				cover any information collected through any other website operated
				by third parties, such as linked websites operated by sponsors,
				advertisers or game developers.<br>
				<br> This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect
				even if your use or participation in the Site or any particular
				Service, tournament or game offered through the Site terminates or
				ceases, or is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not
				agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the
				Site or any of the activities or Services offered through the Site.<br>
				<br> Finally, this Privacy Policy explains how we manage and
				safeguard personal information in the course of operating our
				business. We are dedicated to adhering to the following principles
				that relate to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of
				Personal Information (as defined below).
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">1. ACCOUNTABILITY</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				Virgin Gaming is accountable for all Personal Information in its
				control. This includes information under the direct control of
				Virgin Gaming, as well as Personal Information that Virgin Gaming
				may transfer to its affiliates or to third party service providers
				for servicing, processing, storage or other purposes that facilitate
				Virgin Gaming's business operations. Virgin Gaming will use
				contractual or other measures to require third parties that process
				information or provide services on our behalf to maintain a level of
				privacy protection comparable to our own practices. By way of
				example, Virgin Gaming uses third parties such as payment processing
				service providers, printing and mailing services, data storage and
				destruction facilities, and outsourced technology support service
				providers.<br>
				<br> Numerous individuals within Virgin Gaming are responsible
				for the day-to-day collection and processing of Personal
				Information, including technical and administration personnel
				trained for this purpose. However, Virgin Gaming has a designated
				Privacy Officer who is responsible for Virgin Gaming's compliance
				with applicable privacy legislation. Any questions or concerns with
				regard to the manner in which Virgin Gaming handles or manages
				Personal Information, or in respect of this Privacy Policy should be
				directed to our Privacy Officer who can be reached as follows:<br>
				<br> Virgin Gaming Privacy Officer <br>
				<span class="f6 blackColor">Email:&nbsp;</span><span class="f6"><a class="blueColor" href="mailto:privacy@virgingaming.com">privacy@virgingaming.com</a></span>
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">Information is collected on the Site
				when a user creates a member account, through a member's completion
				of contact forms and surveys, and through his or her interaction
				with the Site (for example, information about which games you play,
				player rating information and player game statistics). Members may
				also disclose information about themselves when they use features on
				the Site, such as user forums, the "Invite Your Friends /
				Tell-A-Friend" feature, or when they contact Customer Care. We
				collect the names and e-mail addresses of the member's friends when
				the member uses the "Invite Your Friends / Tell-A-Friend" feature on
				the Site. We may also require you to provide additional personal
				information, such as a copy of a driver's license, bank statement or
				utility bill in the process of address and identity verification to
				confirm your eligibility to participate in our Site. Address and
				identity verification are a mandatory part of the withdrawal
				process.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">A. What information is collected
				through the sites?</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">Types of Information</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">We collect two types of information from
				you when you visit the Site: information that does not identify you
				personally ("Non-Personal Information"); and information that does
				identify you personally ("Personal Information").</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">(i) Non-Personal Information</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">Our Web servers may automatically record
				certain technical information related to your visit to the Site.
				This information is anonymous and does not identify you personally.
				It includes things such as: the Internet domain for your Internet
				service provider; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer
				accessing the Site; the address of the last webpage that you visited
				prior to clicking through to the Site; the browser used and the type
				of computer operating system that your computer is using;
				information about your computer hardware; the date and time that you
				visited the Site; and a record of which pages you viewed while you
				were visiting the Site. Other information such as demographic
				information which does not identify an individual is also considered
				Non-Personal Information. Gamer Information (described below) is
				also considered Non- Personal Information.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">(ii) Personal Information</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				When you create a free, basic user account (a "Basic Account"), you
				consent to our collection of Personal Information including your
				email address. If you choose to create an account which will allow
				you to enter cash games and tournaments (a "Real Money Account"),
				you will also be required to provide additional information such as
				your name, gender, date of birth and mailing address. If you choose
				to make a deposit into your Real Money Account, you will also be
				required to provide information relevant to your payment method (for
				example your credit card number and expiry date).<br>
				<br> As noted above, the Site also provide you with certain ways
				to voluntarily give us your Personal Information. You may also use
				the features of the Site to invite others to create Basic Accounts
				or Real Money Accounts. We may also collect Personal Information
				about you if you choose to send us an email message using links
				contained on the Site. You may also disclose Personal Information
				when you post content to user forums on the Site or when you contact
				Virgin Gaming's Customer Care representatives via live chat or
				email. Certain information about your activity on the Site is not
				itself Personal Information (for example, information about your
				game play preferences) but may be linked to your account
				information. For example, the following information ("Gamer
				Information") is publicly displayed on the Site and, provided it
				doesn't identify you personally, shall not be considered Personal
				Information:<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* your Username or Alias<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* your Skill Rating<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* your Top Players Ranking (if any)
				and your Virgin Gaming Points balance<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* your scores in games and
				tournaments<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* your gaming preferences or your
				personal motto<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* summary of your gaming activity,
				including when you joined, the number of games that you have played<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* winnings from games and
				tournaments<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* any personal information you chose
				to disclose in a chat window or discussion forums on the sites<br>
				<br> We may include footage of gameplay in promotional materials
				such as trailers which may be displayed on the Site, or on website
				run by other parties including those of our marketing partners. For
				example, we may display "play of the week", "highlight reel" or
				similar content. This content may also include the use of Gamer
				Information.<br>
				<br> In order to provide a fair playing environment for all users
				and to protect the integrity of the Site, we also collect Personal
				Information which we use to investigate complaints of cheating or
				behavior that we believe may be contrary to the T&amp;Cs, including the
				Rules of Conduct. This may include screenshots of players' computer
				desktops or footage of in-game play.<br>
				<br> In addition to collecting Personal Information directly from
				visitors to the Site, we may also collect Personal Information from
				third parties such as marketing partners who have been granted
				permission to share that information with us.<br>
				<br> When you download any Virgin Gaming Widget or a Virgin
				Gaming application, you may also be provided with the opportunity to
				download software provided by parties other than Virgin Gaming (for
				example, Xfire from Xfire, Inc.). Please note that when you install
				and use software provided by third parties, any information that you
				provide through such use (including Personal Information) will be
				subject to the privacy policy of that software provider, and not
				this Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">Facebook Connect</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">When you register with us through the
				Site to become a Member of Virgin Gaming, we will ask you for
				personally identifiable information. This refers to information
				about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal
				Information"). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to,
				your name, age, country of residence and email address. You can
				register to join Virgin Gaming via the Site or by logging into your
				account with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS")
				(i.e., Facebook) via our Site. If you decide to create your Account
				by logging into a SNS via the Site, we will extract the Personal
				Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name,
				email address and other information you make publicly available via
				the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that
				information to create your Account; the information we extract may
				depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. For example,
				our Service allows users to create an account and login to the
				Service using their Facebook account credentials through Facebook
				Connect. If you are not currently registered as a Member and you
				click on "Sign in Using Facebook", you will first be asked to enter
				your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register
				and join Virgin Gaming. By using Facebook Connect, you are allowing
				Virgin Gaming to access your Facebook account information and you
				are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the
				Service via Facebook.
			</p><p>
			</p><p class="f7 grayColorPadding">B. What are "cookies" and how does
				the Site use them?</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification
				number that is transferred (through your browser) from a website to
				the hard drive of your computer. The cookie identifies your browser
				but will not let a website know any Personal Information about you,
				such as your name or address. These files are then used by such
				websites as a kind of electronic identification tag when users
				revisit that site. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot
				run on your computer, search your computer for other information, or
				transmit any information to anyone.<br>
				<br> As with many major websites, the Site use cookies. Cookies
				are used by the Site so that we can recognize you when you return to
				the Site and personalize your settings and preferences. Most
				browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you wish, you
				can change your browser settings either to notify you when you have
				received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies.
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">C. Personal Information about
				Children</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">Our Site is intended for a general
				audience and we do not knowingly collect or store Personal
				Information about children under the age of 13. Indeed, pursuant to
				the T&amp;Cs, we do not allow people under 18 years of age to create
				accounts on the Site and we do not knowingly collect Personal
				Information from people under 18 years of age through our Site. In
				addition, in the event that a visitor to our Site identifies himself
				or herself as a person under the age of 18, we will not collect,
				store or use any Personal Information of such individual. In the
				event that we receive Personal Information that we discover was
				provided by a person under the age of 18, we will promptly delete
				all such Personal Information not required for continuing business
				purposes and will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S.
				Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">D. Limits to Collecting Personal
				Information</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">We limit the type of mandatory
				information collected by us. We collect only the Personal
				Information that is required to operate our Site, ensures compliance
				with the T&amp;Cs, and enables us to manage our relationship with our
				customers, including the uses described in the following paragraphs
				under the heading "Use and Disclosure of Personal Information"
				below.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">3. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL
				INFORMATION</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">A. Internal Uses</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				We collect Personal Information to operate our Site, including to
				open and maintain customer accounts with us, to contact customers
				regarding updates of the Site, their account status, new products
				and services and upcoming events, to collect subscription and entry
				fees from users, to process payments, to prevent fraud and protect
				the integrity of the Site, and to deliver prizes to users. We use
				your date of birth and address information to ensure that you comply
				with the T&amp;Cs and are permitted to create an account based upon
				where you reside. We also collect Personal Information to facilitate
				a fair gameplay environment and for fraud prevention. We may also,
				but do not have any obligation to, use Personal Information to
				contact customers regarding changes to the T&amp;Cs and any other
				policies or agreements relevant to the Site, including this Privacy
				Policy. If a member uses the "Invite Your Friends / Tell-A-Friend"
				feature, we will use the name and e-mail address that that member
				provides to invite his or her friend to create a user account.<br>
				<br> In addition to the uses above, we use Personal Information
				for feedback and marketing purposes, to promote goods and services
				we believe you may be interested in, to provide a product or service
				requested by you, to notify you of changes to our products and
				services, and to customize and improve the content and layout of the
				Site. When you create your account, you can customize these
				preferences. If you wish to change your account preferences to
				modify the ways that we contact you, please contact Customer Care or
				use the "unsubscribe" link included in all email messages sent on
				our behalf.
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">B. Authorized Third-Party Service
				Providers</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">In addition to sharing information
				between entities comprising the Virgin Gaming group for the purposes
				above, and in order to better serve our customers, we may transfer
				Personal Information to third-party service providers who are
				legally or contractually obligated to only use the information to
				help us provide our Services and not for any other purpose. For
				example, and as described above, Virgin Gaming uses outside
				contractors to supply services such as payment processing, business
				analytics, customer support, printing and mailing, data storage and
				destruction, software development, security management, IT
				infrastructure management, technology support, etc.. These third
				parties may be located in the United States, Canada or elsewhere.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">C. Co-Branded Partners</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom Virgin Gaming may
				jointly offer a Service or feature, such as a Tournament. You can
				tell when you are accessing a Service offered by a Co-Branded
				Partner because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured
				prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself
				to register for a Service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. In doing
				so, you may be providing your Personal Information to both us and
				the Co-Branded Partner, or we may share your Personal Information
				with the Co-Branded Partner. Please note that the Co-Branded
				Partner's privacy policy may apply to its use of your Personal
				Information.<br>
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">D. Marketing Partners</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				We may also disclose Personal Information you provide us to third
				party marketing partners who provide products, information or
				services you have expressly requested and which we believe you may
				be interested in purchasing or obtaining. In doing so, we will make
				reasonable efforts to ensure that these third parties only use the
				Personal Information for our stated purposes and that they provide a
				method of opting out from receiving future communications from such
				parties, but we shall not be responsible for their handling or
				dissemination practices with respect to Personal Information. If you
				wish to change your account preferences to not receive information
				from such third party marketing partners, please contact Customer
				Care or use the "unsubscribe" link included in email messages sent
				by such parties. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">E. Legal Compliance</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				There may be instances when Virgin Gaming may disclose Personal
				Information without providing notice or choice, including: (i)
				pursuant to a subpoena, other form of legal process or request on
				behalf of any local, provincial, state, or federal governmental
				department or agency to investigate, prevent, or take action
				regarding illegal activities; (ii) protect the safety and physical
				security of users of the Services or members of the public; (iii) to
				protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) to
				comply with applicable laws or legal process. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">F. Business Transfers</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				If Virgin Gaming sells all or part of its business or makes a sale
				or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or
				transfer of all or a material part of its business, Virgin Gaming
				may transfer your Personal Information to the party or parties
				involved in the transaction as part of that transaction. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">4. OBTAINING CONSENT</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">In most cases, when we do collect
				Personal Information directly from an individual, the individual
				provides us with the information required for us to effectively
				provide our Services, and as such, consent to the collection and use
				of Personal Information will be implied by use of the Services (see
				the T&amp;Cs). If we choose to use Personal Information already in our
				possession for a purpose that was not identified at the time we
				initially collected the information, we will seek the consent of the
				affected individuals before using this information for the new
				purpose. Please note that if the new purpose is required or
				permitted by law, Virgin Gaming is not required to seek the consent
				of the affected individuals and may not do so. Individuals may
				withdraw consent to the collection, use and disclosure of their
				Personal Information at any time, subject to certain restrictions
				set out in applicable privacy legislation, but should recognize that
				by doing so they may be unable to utilize the Services and products
				offered on the Site. When a member uses the "Invite Your Friends /
				Tell-A-Friend" feature, we rely on that individual to obtain the
				consent of their friend to allow us to use that information to
				invite them to create a user account.</p>
			<p class="f7 grayColorPadding">5. MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL
				INFORMATION</p>
			<p class="f6 blackColor">
				Virgin Gaming has policies and procedures as to how long it retains
				information that it collects. Personal Information that is no longer
				required to fulfill the purposes identified when the information was
				collected is either destroyed, erased or rendered anonymous to
				prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.
				We retain Personal Information received from third parties in
				accordance with our legal and contractual obligations.<br>
				<br> Personal Information included in computer databases is
				typically stored in a secure data center with an extra copy of the
				data stored at an alternate location of equal security to ensure
				that we will be able to retrieve the data even in the event of a
				disaster. These computer databases may be located in Canada, the
				United States or elsewhere in the world. From time to time, we may
				transfer Personal Information stored in these databases (as
				otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy) to third-party
				service providers located in Canada, the United States or elsewhere
				in the world. For example, certain third-party service providers
				such as data storage companies, computer security specialists,
				database technicians, or corporate affiliates of Virgin Gaming may
				have remote access to Personal Information in our custody, but we
				use contractual and other safeguards to ensure that Personal
				Information transferred to such parties is provided with a
				comparable level of protection as Virgin Gaming provides, regardless
				of the format in which the information exists.<br>
				<br> Virgin Gaming has implemented a variety of commercially
				reasonable security safeguards to protect Personal Information in
				our control against loss, theft, misuse and interception by third
				parties. These safeguards include organizational, technical and
				physical measures designed to protect information from unauthorized
				access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. Among the steps
				taken are:<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* premises security;<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* restricted file access to Personal
				Information;<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* technology safeguards, including
				security software, firewalls to prevent hacking and other
				unauthorized <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer
				access; and<br>
				<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* internal password and security
