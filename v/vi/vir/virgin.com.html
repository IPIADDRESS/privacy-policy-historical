Please note that by continuing to use the Virgin.com site you are agreeing to any updated versions.</p>    <h2 class="h-b anchor" id="cookies">What are cookies?</h2>    <p>We use "cookies" to store and collect information regarding your use of our site. Cookies are small pieces of information stored by the browser on your computer's hard drive. They send the information stored on them back to our web server when you access our site. These cookies enable us to load the site in such a way as to reflect your personal preferences (based on your previous browsing on Virgin.com as well as keywords we may be able to gather from the URLs of webpages from which you accessed Virgin.com, your IP address and any search engine used to reach Virgin.com). We use these cookies to improve your experience on our site and recommend content that may be of interest to you. You can find out more about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org </a>and more about the cookies we use below.</p>    <h2 class="h-b">What cookies do we use?</h2>    <p>We only set a few cookies ourselves, but when we include content from other sites (like Facebook or Twitter), they also get the opportunity to set cookies, to help them serve their content better. We've broken down the main uses of cookies you'll see on the site below, and what they are used for, but we can't guarantee that we'll have listed every cookie you might get from a third party - they can change them at any time as their needs change.</p>    <h2 class="h-b">The Virgin cookie:</h2>    <p>- Contains a random ID&nbsp;</p>    <p>- This id is then used to store information about your browsing history on Virgin.com&nbsp;</p>    <p>- Uses an&nbsp;encrypted section of the cookie to ensure that no other user can "simulate" your cookie and impersonate you</p>    <p>&nbsp;- Has an expiry of 30 days</p>    <p>For more information please get in touch with the webmaster at the address below:</p>    <p>The Webmaster<br>  Virgin.com Limited<br>  c/o Virgin Management Limited<br>  The Battleship Building<br>  179 Harrow Road<br>  London W2 6NB<br>  UK</p>    <h2 class="h-a">Cookies for Measuring Web Traffic</h2>    <p>We make use of a tool from Google called Google analytics which tells us about the way people are using Virgin.com. It uses cookies to detect that someone has been to the site before, so that we can see how often people return to the site, how long they stay, and where on Virgin.com they tend to go. We use this to try to work out what kind of experience they're having on the site, so we can make it better.</p>    <p>Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of people visiting Virgin.com, and let us see how they're moving around the site. We use this when we make decisions on the type of content we create and how we structure the site. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html">To read Google’s privacy policy please click here.&nbsp;</a></p>    <h2 class="h-a">Cookies From Social Networks</h2>    <p>Because Virgin (and Richard) have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. For that reason we include recommendations from Facebook, tweets from Twitter, content from Google+ and add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site.</p>    <p>When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use cookies. They can't read any cookies we set from Virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of Virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged in. For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Richard Branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>    <h2 class="h-b">Facebook</h2>    <p>We use several Facebook social plugins on Virgin.com, including the Like button, Facebook comments, recommendations and connect. Facebook will access some cookies if you have been to Facebook previously. If you haven't visited Facebook, no cookies will be added.&nbsp; For more information about how Facebook uses cookies, please see their support site <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/445588775451827.">http://www.facebook.com/help/445588775451827.</a></p>    <h2 class="h-b">Twitter</h2>    <p>We make use of Twitter social plugins in order to allow following our Twitter accounts easily, share content via Twitter, and to display the latest tweet for Virgin and Richard Branson. Twitter makes use of cookies to improve its own service. You can read more about how Twitter users cookies in their privacy policy <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a></p>    <h2 class="h-b">Add this</h2>    <p>We use ‘Add This’ on our site to enable you to easily share the content you view on Virgin.com.&nbsp; For more information about ’Add This’, see their privacy policy <a href="http://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy#.UjdI8cakr6M">http://www.addthis.com/privacy/privacy-policy#.UjdI8cakr6M</a></p>    <h2 class="h-b">Google+</h2>    <p>We include a Google+ plugin on many of our news and blog post pages to allow viewers to share links via that service. That plugin sets the following cookies, though you will get a different mix of cookies depending on whether you are logged in to Google and Google+, or not. For more information about the Google +1 button, see their privacy policy <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/+/policy/+1button.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/+/policy/+1button.html</a></p>    <h2 class="h-b">Cookies For Adverts</h2>    <p>We have a number of spots around the site that show advertisments for companies in the Virgin Group. These are managed through a system called Google Doubleclick For Publishers. We use this for the obvious things, like the banner advertisments, but also for purposes like the logos of the Featured Companies. Doubleclick make use of cookies in order to track who has seent what adverts, in order to track which adverts are working better.</p>    <h2 class="h-b">Google Doubleclick</h2>    <p>One of the ways that we link to the different Virgin companies on Virgin.com is via advertising positions. These include banner ads, but also the logos of Featured Companies on the front page. This allows us to track which adverts are doing well, and it also makes it easy for companies in the Virgin Group to give us assets to put in those slots. We use a platform called Doubleclick for Publishers, which is part of Google's advertising system. For more information about Doubleclick, privacy, and opting out of ad tracking, see this Google page on ad privacy <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/">http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/ads/</a></p>    <h2 class="h-a">Cookies for Content</h2>    <p>We include content from other sites in our updates, most notably YouTube videos. When we do this, YouTube may store cookies in order to track how people are watching videos from their site.</p>    <h2 class="h-b">How do we collect information from you with Facebook Connect?</h2>    <p>When you use Virgin.com, you have the option to connect your Facebook account to Virgin.com.&nbsp; If you decide to ‘connect’ your Facebook account, we will gather certain information from your account so that we can display the content on the site in a way that we think would be optimal for your enjoyment of the site.</p>    <p>In order for us to access this information, you will have to manually click the Facebook Connect button on the site.
