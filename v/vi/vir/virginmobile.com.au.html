              Virgin Mobile recognises the trust you place in us when you give

              giving the personal information of its customers to other businesses. 
              Other than with service providers (explained below) and where it 
              is authorised by law, our policy is that we do not generally give

              give us consent to sharing their personal information.<br>
              <br>
              Sometimes we use service providers to help us run aspects of our 
              business efficiently, such as couriers and computer security companies. 
              To the extent that these service providers gain access to the personal 
              information of customers, they are covered by strict privacy rules 
              that prevent them from keeping this information for themselves or 
              using this information for any other purposes. </td>
