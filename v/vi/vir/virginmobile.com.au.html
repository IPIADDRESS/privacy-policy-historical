                        will be treated when you use the web site at "www.virginmobile.com" (“web
                        site”) or when any goods or services are offered
                        to you by or on behalf of Virgin Mobile (Australia) Pty
                        Ltd (ABN 67 092 726 442) (“Virgin Mobile”). </p>
                      <p>By providing your personal information to Virgin Mobile,
                        through the web site, our call centre or otherwise, you

                        in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not

                      <p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, there may also be
                        additional privacy provisions that apply to certain sections

                        Mobile. Because these additional provisions also relate
                        to your privacy protection, you should review them wherever
                        they are accessible to you on the web site or in the
                        terms and conditions for the service. If there is any
                        inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and those additional

                        This policy explains the key measures we have taken to
                        implement the requirements of the Telecommunications
                        Act 1997 and the Privacy Act 1998, which implements the
                        National Privacy Principles. It aims to answer the questions
                        you might have about how we collect, use and disclose
                        your personal information. If you have any further questions

                        We hold information that you have provided to us about
                          yourself, and information about your use of our services
                          such as billing and calling information. The information
                          that we collect will depend on how you use the facilities
                          offered by Virgin Mobile. Information that you might
                        have provided to us includes:</p>

                            example, your contact details, driver’s licence
                            number, photo identification, general demographic

                          We collect information about you to provide you
                                  with a particular product or service. We may
                                  also use personal
                        information for related purposes such as:</p>

                            purposes;</li>
                        <li> providing your contact details to Telstra as required
                                  by law, so that your number can be used by emergency
                            services and for other approved purposes;</li>
                        <li> protecting you and Virgin Mobile from error and fraud; </li>
                        <li> preventing a serious credit infringement;</li>
                        <li> improving the web site; and</li>
                        <li> 
                            developing a better understanding of our customers’ needs. </li>
                      </ul>                      <p>If you do not provide us with your personal information,
                        we cannot provide you with these services. </p>
                      <p><strong>4. Are there any other times when you use my information
                        for any other purpose or give this information to someone
                        else?</strong><br>
                        Virgin Mobile recognises the trust you place in us when
                        you give us your personal information. Other than disclosure
                        to service providers (explained below) or as required
                        by law (for example, disclosure to various Government
                        departments or to courts), our policy is that we do not
                        generally give your personal information to other organisations
                        unless you have given us your consent to do so. </p>
                      <p>We may share your personal information with affinity
                        partners, service providers and other third parties to
                        help us run aspects of our business efficiently. Occasionally
                        Virgin Mobile might also use your personal information
                        for other purposes or share your information with another
                        organisation because:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> we believe it is necessary to provide you
                          with a service which you have requested;</li>
                        <li> we believe it necessary to implement our terms of service;</li>
                        <li> we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property
                                or personal safety of another Virgin Mobile user,
    any member of the public or Virgin Mobile; </li>
                        <li> we believe it is necessary to do so to prevent or help
                                  detect fraud or serious credit infringements - for
      example, we may share information with other phone companies,
                                  credit reporting agencies, law enforcement agencies
      and fraud prevention units; </li>
                        <li> 
                            we believe it is necessary to protect the interests of
                                    Virgin Mobile – for example, disclosure to
                                    a court in the event of legal action to which Virgin
                                    Mobile is
                                    a party; or </li>
                        <li> the assets and operations of the business are being transferred
                                      to another party as a going concern.</li>
                      </ul>                      <p>When we share information with other organisations and
                        service providers as set out above, we do so in accordance
                        with this Privacy Policy. To the extent that these organisations
                        and service providers gain access to your personal information,
                        they are covered by strict privacy rules that prevent
                        them from keeping this information or using this information
                        for any other purpose.</p>
                      <p><strong>5. Do I have to receive marketing information from Virgin
                        Mobile?</strong><br>
                        Virgin Mobile strives to offer the best deals in the
                        communications business, so we like to keep you up to
                        date with our special offers and new services, unless
                        you’ve specifically asked us not to. Please note
                        that once you’ve sign up to a Virgin Mobile service,
                        you can choose not to receive marketing information from
                        us by calling the Virgin Mobile team on 1300 555 100
                        at any time. Also if you’ve said “No thanks” to
                        receiving information, you can always call the same number
                        to change to a “Yes”.</p>
                      <p><strong>6.	Why do you give my details to Telstra?</strong><br>
                        When you are allocated a telephone number, Virgin Mobile
                          is required by law to give certain details about you
                          and your number to the Integrated Public Number Database
                          (“IPND”) managed by Telstra. The information
                          provided to the IPND includes the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>your telephone number/s;</li>
                        <li> your name and the name of the end-user (if different
                          from the name of the purchaser);</li>
                        <li> your address;</li>
                        <li> 
                            the purposes for which the telephone number will be used – for
                                example, business, charitable or residential purposes;
                                and</li>
                        <li> 
                            whether your number/s is “listed”, “unlisted” or
                                  a “suppressed address record”.</li>
                      </ul>                      <p>The IPND is a resource for the telecommunications industry,
                        law enforcement agencies, directory publishers, national
                        security agencies and emergency services organisations.
                        There are strict laws governing the use and disclosure
                        of your information in connection with the IPND.</p>
                      <p>Generally a mobile number will be “unlisted”.
                        That means your number will not be used in a public number

                        of assisting law enforcement agencies, national security
                        agencies and emergency services organisations. If you

                      <p><strong>7. Do you use cookies and all that stuff on your web
                        site?</strong><br>
                        Our web site is designed to give you useful information
                        about Virgin Mobile products and to allow you as much
                        as possible to tell us how to manage your services online.
                        We use cookies to ensure you can make online transactions
                        securely. Cookies are pieces of information that a web
                        site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for
                        record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to
                        accept cookies. Virgin Mobile also uses cookies to measure
                        our customers’ interest in different parts of our
                        web site. Cookies are useful to estimate the number of
                        visitors to our web site and determine overall traffic
                        patterns. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you
                        may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean
                        you will not be able to take full advantage of Virgin
                        Mobile’s online services.</p>
                      <p><strong>8.	How can I access the information you keep about me?</strong><br>
                        If at any time you want to know what personal information
                          we hold about you, you are welcome to request a copy
                          of your customer record by calling the Virgin Mobile
                          team on 1300 555 100. We aim to respond to most requests
                          within 14 days, or if the request is more detailed,
                          within 30 days. VMA may recover from you its reasonable
                          cost of supplying you with this information.</p>
                      <p><strong>9. How do I change or delete the information that you
                        have about me?</strong><br>
                        If at any time you wish to change personal information
                        that is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us
                        and we will take reasonable steps to amend our records.
                        If you want us to delete the information we hold about
                        you, please let us know and we will do our best to delete
                        it unless we need to keep if for any of the purposes
                        identified in Items 3 or 4 of this Privacy Policy or
                        for legal reasons. For example, Virgin Mobile is required
                        to keep information about the purchasers and end users
                        of pre-paid mobile services for as long as the service
                        is activated.</p>
                      <p><strong>10.	Is the information Virgin Mobile has about me secure?</strong><br>
                        Virgin Mobile endeavours to take all reasonable steps
                          to keep your personal information secure. We store
                          this information on secure servers that are protected
                          in access-controlled facilities. Only authorised users
                          can access your personal information, and access is
                          only for approved purposes. We train our staff and
                          require our data operators to respect the privacy and
                          confidentiality of your information. <br>
                        Unfortunately, we can’t give you an absolute guarantee
                        that your information is always secure. For example,
                        no data sent over the internet is 100% secure. While
                        we do out best, we can’t be held responsible for
                        events arising from unauthorised access to your personal
                        information.</p>
                      <p><strong>11.	What can I do to keep information about me secure?</strong><br>
                        You play an important role in keeping your personal information
                          secure. It is your responsibility to keep any password,
                          PIN or other ID check information confidential. Do
                          not share this information with anyone. Please notify
                          us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of
                          your account by anyone or there is any other breach
                          of security.</p>
                      <p><strong>12. What happens to my information if I enter it on
                        a different web site linked to the Virgin Mobile site?</strong><br>
                        Virgin Mobile provides links to some other web sites
                        outside of the Virgin Mobile service. These linked sites
                        are not under our control, so we are not responsible
                        for the conduct of companies linked to our web site.
                        Before you enter information on to those sites, you should
                        look at their privacy policy and terms and conditions
                        of use.</p>
                      <p><strong>13.	Do you have information on people other than customers?</strong><br>
                        Most of the personal information that Virgin Mobile has
                          concerns our customers. But we also keep information
                          about people who provide information via the web site,
                          apply for a service (even if the application is declined)
                          or express an interest in our services, such as by
                          making an inquiry or asking us to contact them when
                          their current mobile phone contract expires. This policy
                          applies to those people as well. We also hold personal
                          information on contractors and employees, which are
                          covered by separate policies. </p>
                      <p><strong>14. What if ownership of the Virgin Mobile business
                        changes?</strong><br>
                        In the unlikely event that ownership of part or all of
                        the Virgin Mobile business changes, your personal information
                        will be transferred to the new owner of the business.</p>
                      <p><strong>15.	What to do if you have a problem, question or complaint?</strong><br>
                        If you have any further queries relating to our Privacy
                          Policy, or you have a problem or complaint, please
                          call the Virgin Mobile team on 1300 555 100 or contact
                          us at privacy@virginmobile.com.au. If Virgin Mobile
                          becomes aware of any ongoing concerns or problems with
                          customer information, we will take these issues seriously
                          and work to address these concerns. </p>
                      <p><strong>16.	Future changes</strong><br>
                        Virgin Mobile aims to be the best in the telecommunications
                          industry. That means our business will continue to
                          evolve as we introduce new products and services and
                          add new features to our web site. Because of this,
                          from time to time, our policies will be reviewed and
                          may be revised. Virgin Mobile reserves the right to
                          change this Privacy Policy at any time and notify you
                          by posting an updated version of the Policy on its
                          web site. The amended Privacy Policy will apply between
                          us whether or not we have given you specific notice
                          of any change. We encourage you to review this Privacy
                          Policy periodically because it may change from time
                          to time. </p>
