      Virgin Mobile strives to offer the best deals in the communications business,

      unless you've specifically asked us not to. Please note that when a new
      customer signs up with Virgin Mobile, they can choose to receive or not
      receive marketing communications from us. Existing customers have the same
      choice by contacting the Virgin Mobile team on 1300 555 100 at any time.
      If they don't, we'll assume they're happy to continue hearing about our
      great deals. </td>

      Virgin Mobile recognises the trust you place in us when you give us personal
      information. Virgin Mobile has a strict policy about giving the personal
      information of its customers to other businesses. Other than with service
      providers (explained below) and where it is authorised by law, our policy
      is that we do not generally give information on customers to other businesses
      unless those customers give us consent to sharing their personal information.<br>
                                                                      <br>
      Sometimes we use service providers to help us run aspects of our business
      efficiently, such as couriers and computer security companies. To the extent
      that these service providers gain access to the personal information of
      customers, they are covered by strict privacy rules that prevent them from
      keeping this information for themselves or using this information for any
      other purposes. </td>

      Virgin Mobile endeavours to take all reasonable steps to keep any information

      Unfortunately, we can't give you an absolute guarantee that customer information
      is always secure. For example, no data sent over the internet is 100% secure.
      While we do our best, we can't be held responsible for events arising from

      Most of the personal information that Virgin Mobile has concerns our customers.
      But we also keep information about people who have expressed an interest
      in our services, such as by making an enquiry or asking us to contact them
      when their current mobile phone contract expires. This policy applies to
      those people as well. We also hold personal information on contractors
      and employees, which are covered by separate policies. </td>

      Virgin Mobile aims to be the best in the telecommunications industry. That
