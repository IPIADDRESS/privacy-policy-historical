<br>
Privacy Policy Guiding Principles<br>
</p><ul><li>Any information that you submit to us through our Web site - whether through a survey, registration form or e-mail - will be used exclusively by Virginia Mason Medical Center.<br>
</li><li>We will use your personal information only for the specific reason for which you submitted it, (i.e., registering for a class).<br>
</li><li>We will take every reasonable precaution to protect your personal information including encryption with SSL technology and passwords when appropriate.<br>
</li><li>You will receive e-mail only for information that you have requested or as confirmation of information that you submitted (i.e., class registration).<br>
</li></ul><br>
<p>Virginia Mason will use overall demographic data of our Web users to improve the site and enhance services. These demographic trends will not be traceable to an individual's personal information. On rare occasions, Virginia Mason may contact registered users by e-mail to inquire about interest in potential new Web services.<br>
