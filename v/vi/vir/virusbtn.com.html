<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="chapter" name="h2-cookies"></a>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on your computer's hard drive and retrieve it later. The VB extranet uses cookies for the purpose of allowing users to login and for keeping users logged in between sessions.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers allow the user to enable or disable the use of cookies. For specific instructions to enable or disable cookies on your computer, please refer to the documentation for your browser software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="chapter" name="h2-links-other-sites"></a>Links to other sites</h2>
<p>The Virus Bulletin website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that this privacy policy only applies to Virus Bulletin's sites (<a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/" target="_blank">www.virusbulletin.com</a>, <a href="https://extranet.virusbulletin.com/">extranet.virusbulletin.com</a>,and any other sites hosted on the virusbulletin.com domain). Virus Bulletin is not responsible for the content or privacy policy of any other sites. If you go to another website from this one, you are advised to read the privacy policy on that website to find out what it does with your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="chapter" name="h2-how-does-virus-bulletin-use-your-personal-data"></a>How does Virus Bulletin use your personal data?</h2>
<p>In broad terms, Virus Bulletin uses your personal data in the following ways: to provide goods and services to you, to communicate with you about the services you have requested, for record-keeping purposes, and to let you know about other Virus Bulletin goods and services in which you may be interested.</p>
<p>Virus Bulletin also uses non-identifying and aggregate information in order to improve the design and functionality of the Site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
<p>Every time a user visits the Site we store a log of the visit that shows: the IP address of the machine used to access the Internet, the browser used, the time and length of the visit, the pages visited, the referring site (where appropriate), and whether any page requests were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>This information is collected and processed in aggregate, and no attempt is made to link this information back to the user, or to identify them from the information provided. The data is used to help us to understand which areas of the Site are popular, as well as identify which pages are not being requested. It also tells us how many people are visiting the Site in total. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a class="chapter" name="h3-conference-delegates"></a>Conference delegates</h3>
<p>When you use this site to purchase a ticket to a VB conference, Virus Bulletin will collect personal details including your name, company name, job title, country, and email address. Virus Bulletin will collect this information both for purchasers of tickets (who are registered users of the extranet) and for every VB conference attendee (who may not be registered users of the extranet).</p>
<p>When you purchase a ticket to a VB conference, you will also need to submit your credit card details; these are entered directly on our online payments processor's web interface and are not processed or held by Virus Bulletin. Our online payments processor is currently <a href="https://www.sagepay.co.uk/" target="_blank">SagePay</a>.</p>
<p>When you register as a delegate for a Virus Bulletin conference (whether you do so yourself or someone else does this on your behalf), Virus Bulletin uses your personal details in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and company name are used to produce a name badge to be worn at the event.</li>
<li>Your name, company name and country are included on a list of delegates ("delegate list"), which is made available to all attendees of the event in question and may also be shared (after the event) with potential customers. (Should you wish to opt out of having your details included on this list, you can do so by sending us an email on <a href="mailto:conference@virusbulletin.com" target="_blank">conference@virusbulletin.com</a>.)</li>
<li>Your email address may be used to send you information both about the conference and about other Virus Bulletin services (for example future conferences). You may opt out of receiving information about other Virus Bulletin services either during the registration process or by sending us an email on <a href="mailto:conference@virusbulletin.com">conference@virusbulletin.com</a>.</li>
<li>Your partner's name (if applicable) is used to produce a name badge for them to wear at the event.</li>
<li>Your dietary requirements (if applicable) are noted and passed onto the conference venue, but not in a personally identifiable fashion – we collect details of special diets required and pass on the numbers only.</li>
<li>If you provide us with feedback about the conference, Virus Bulletin will use this to help with the planning of future events. Virus Bulletin may contact you about the feedback you have provided, but will not share it with any third parties.</li>
<li>Your company, job title and country may be used, in a non-personally identifiable way, to provide demographic information about the conference audience both to potential sponsors of the event and to local government agencies (for example, when the event runs in Canada we may inform the Canadian authorities as to the percentage of conference attendees that come from Canada).</li>
</ul>
<p>At the conference itself, Virus Bulletin takes photographs to record the event. These photographs are kept as a record of the event and may in some cases be used in promotional material, to promote and advertise similar future events. Delegates who do not wish to be included in photographs are asked to make their wishes known to the photographer/VB team and Virus Bulletin will endeavour to honour such requests.</p>
<p>Photographs that contain clearly identifiable individuals will only be used publicly if consent has been gained from the individual(s) in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a class="chapter" name="h3-submitting-abstracts"></a>Submitting abstracts</h3>
<p>When you use this site to submit an abstract (a proposal) for a Virus Bulletin conference paper, Virus Bulletin will use your personal details in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, email address and telephone number will be used to contact you about the submission you have made.</li>
<li>The name, email address and telephone numbers of co-authors listed (if applicable) will be used to contact those people about the submission they are associated with.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a class="chapter" name="h3-submitting-job-seeker-details"></a>Submitting job seeker details</h3>
<p>When you use this site to submit your details as a job seeker, the details you have provided in your personal summary, profile, and online presence, will be listed publicly on our main website (<a href="https://www.virusbulletin.com/" target="_blank">www.virusbulletin.com</a>) along with all the data you have registered in your VB extranet account: your name, email, country, company, job title.

If you don't want your personal data to be listed, we strongly encourage you to create an anonymous account for the purpose of submitting job vacancies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="chapter" name="h2-legal-basis-processing-personal-data"></a>Legal basis for processing personal data</h2>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using personal data will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
