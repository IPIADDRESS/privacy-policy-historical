				    <p class="basic">
				      Please read this policy to understand what information vizisense.com (hereafter referred 
				      to as "ViziSense") collects, how the information is used, and what choices you have 
				      regarding collection and use of your information when using ViziSense.
				    </p>
				    
				    <p class="header">Policy Scope</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      This policy covers information you share, both personally identifiable and non-identifiable 
				      information, with ViziSense as a visitor to the ViziSense web site. If you are a publisher 
				      using ViziSense's Publisher Program, then you are subject to the ViziSense Publisher Terms 
				      and Conditions. Please refer to the ViziSense Publisher Terms and Conditions for more 
				      information if this pertains to you.
				    </p>
				    
				    <p class="header">Information We Collect</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      ViziSense collects both personally identifiable information as well as non-personally 
				      identifiable information.
				    </p>
				    
				    <p class="header">Personally Identifiable Information</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      Personally identifiable information is any information that identifies a specific 
				      individual, such as a name, email address, or phone number. To access ViziSense's 
				      Publisher Program, every user is required to provide a valid login and password. 
				      The login is assigned either by ViziSense or the publisher's designated network 
				      administrator. The login is associated with the user's personally identifiable information, 
				      consisting of his or her name, company, business email address, telephone numbers, and 
				      business address. ViziSense also collects personally-identifiable information when a 
				      user submits a comment or a query to our customer support staff or opts in to share his 
				      details for receiving updates from ViziSense. Personally identifiable information may 
				      be transferred or used by technology service providers that ViziSense works with. These 
				      providers require access to information in order to provide services to the user. 
				    </p>
				    
				    <p class="header">
				      Non-Personally Identifiable Information
				    </p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      The ViziSense web site collects non-personally identifiable information on the ViziSense 
				      web site in the following instances: 
				      </p><ol>
				        <li>
				          <i>Log files: </i> The ViziSense web site collects information about users 
				          and stores it in log files maintained on ViziSense and 3rd party equipment. This 
				          information includes non-personally identifiable information that your browser 
				          automatically sends whenever you visit this site, including information about your 
				          web request, your IP address your browser type, browser language, date and time of the 
				          request. 
				        </li>
				        <li>
				          <i>Cookies: </i> A session cookie is a small text file that the ViziSense web 
				          site generates and temporarily stores in the memory of the user's computer during the 
				          login session. Each time a user logs on to the ViziSense web site, the site issues a 
				          session cookie. The session cookie is linked to your login and enables ViziSense or 
				          relevant 3rd parties to monitor the ViziSense web site for unauthorized usage. 
				        </li>
				        <li>
				          <i>Clear pixels: </i> Clear pixels (also called web beacons and one-by-one 
				          pixels) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies 
				          that are used to remember the pages or sections of a site that a user visits. The 
				          ViziSense web site can use clear pixels in order to analyze the performance and 
				          usefulness of this site. 
				        </li>
				      </ol>
				    <p></p>
				    
				    <p class="header">Information Use</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      ViziSense uses the personally identifiable information you share with us to respond to 
				      your query, comment, or to verify your credentials for access to its services. ViziSense 
				      also uses the personally-identifiable information you provide to respond to your inquiries 
				      and requests, and to keep accurate records concerning the services you are requesting 
				      through the ViziSense web site. All information may be used for additional purposes, such 
				      as auditing, research, and development of additional web site capabilities or services.
				      ViziSense generally uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregated form to 
				      help us measure the web site's performance and effectiveness, and to improve its 
				      usefulness.

				    <p class="header">Information Sharing</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      ViziSense does not rent or sell the personally identifiable information you share with us 
				      without your prior permission. Personally identifiable information and non-personally 
				      identifiable information may be shared with 3rd party providers, in aggregated or 
				      unaggregated fashion. Some or all of the features of ViziSense's services may be provided 
				      by 3rd parties. In order for you to use ViziSense's services, your information may need 
				      to be transferred to these 3rd parties. Please note that we may also share information in 
				      the event that we are asked to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or 
				      to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as otherwise 
				      permitted by law. If and when we use third parties to assist us in processing your 
				      personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other 
				      appropriate confidentiality and security measures. ViziSense may transfer the information 
				      it collects to any successor in interest to ViziSense (such as a company that acquires 
				      ViziSense), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or 
				      parent).

				    <p class="header">Acceptance of Privacy Policy</p>
				    <p class="basic">
				      When you use the ViziSense web site, you are accepting the terms and conditions of this 
				      Privacy Policy, and ViziSense will have the right to use your information as described
