    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
The following describes the overall company Privacy Policy  of Vizury Interactive Solutions Private Limited (referred to as  "Vizury", "we", "us" and "our"). We  understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential,  especially online. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the  policies below. This Privacy Policy was created to inform you what information  we collect when you visit Vizury.com as well as our customer's (referred to as "Advertisers")  websites; and then how that information is collected and used by companies that  display advertisements(referred to as "Partners"). Those who visit  our Advertisers' websites are referred to as "Prospects" throughout  this policy. Because our Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, we  encourage you to review these pages on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
<strong class="page-header">Personal and Non-Personal  Information </strong>
    <p>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is  data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address,  credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly  available. The PII that Vizury collects from you is information you supply to  us; such as your name, email address, credit card number.<br>
      <br>
    Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by  Vizury and Vizury's Partners, and is used by Vizury for the purpose of online  Retargeting. NPII data collected by Vizury for advertising purposes is  completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect's IP  address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our  Advertiser's and Partner's websites. None of this information, individually or  grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. 
    <strong class="page-header">Purpose of collecting information  from you </strong>      We use your personal information to  get in touch with you when necessary or to provide the services requested by  you. We sometimes use this information internally to direct our efforts for  product improvement or contact you as a survey respondent. Please be informed  that by giving us this information, you are giving us permission to share such  information with any other third party service providers and be contacted by  them to provide products or services you've requested. We will send information  about you to other companies or people only when we need to share your  information to provide the product or service you have requested to enable them  to contact you or we have your consent from you to share the information. <br>
  <br>
      We need to share your information with certain service partners in order to  respond to your queries / comments or to resolve service issues and to serve  you better.<br>
  <br>
      We use the contact information that you have provide to offer you details of  products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you,  including but not limited to newsletters from Vizury. You can easily opt out of  a newsletter by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of this e-mail. <br>
      <br>
      We may also combine different types  of information supplied or collected by us.<br>
      <br>
  <strong>We  do not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with  third parties for their promotional purposes, unless you authorize us to do so. <br>
  </strong><span class="page-header">Cookies</span>In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on a  computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or  another. Vizury uses it's cookies to provide a service known as Retargeting  (details explaining Retargeting found below.) A Prospect receives a cookie from  Vizury and Vizury's Partners when they visit Vizury.com, and / or when they  visit one of Vizury's Advertiser's websites. Vizury has no access to or control  over Partner cookies but requires that each Partner only collect NPII  information for the use of serving retargeted ads. Any Partner found in  violation of this policy will immediately be removed. <br>
  <span class="page-header">Vizury's Use of Cookies and NPII</span>Vizury's technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of  advertisements to our Advertiser's Prospects on our Partner's websites across  the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the  web surfing experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of  interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of Vizury's Advertiser's websites,  a Vizury pixel on that site sets a Vizury cookie on the hard drive of the  Prospect. When that Prospect visits one of Vizury's Partners' websites; our  Partner's website will identify the cookie on hard drive of the Prospect and recognize  that they previously visited our Advertiser's website. The Prospect will then  be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, Vizury will  know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser's website, and then our  Partner's website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner's  website, and wither or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type  information is what Vizury uses in reporting; and in no way can be used to  identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect  outside of Vizury's Advertisers and Partner's websites. <br>
      <br>
    The NPII data collected by Vizury in the above outlined process of Retargeting  will be kept by Vizury for a period not exceeding 20 years; and maintained and  archived in our secured servers. This information is used strictly for  reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information. <br>
