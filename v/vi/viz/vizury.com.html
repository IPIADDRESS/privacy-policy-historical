In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on a computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another. Vizury uses it's cookies to provide a service known as Retargeting (details explaining Retargeting found below.) A Prospect receives a cookie from Vizury and Vizury's Partners when they visit Vizury.com, and / or when they visit one of Vizury's Advertiser's websites.

Vizury's Use of Cookies and NPII


</b></font></div>
<div align="justify"><font class="wsten" face="Calibri">
Vizury's technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements to our Advertiser's Prospects on our Partner's websites across the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of Vizury's Advertiser's websites, a Vizury pixel on that site sets a Vizury cookie on the hard drive of the Prospect. When that Prospect visits one of Vizury's Partners' websites; our Partner's website will identify the cookie on hard drive of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser's website. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, Vizury will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser's website, and then our Partner's website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner's website, and wither or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type information is what Vizury uses in reporting; and in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of Vizury's Advertisers and Partner's websites. 
<br><br>
The NPII data collected by Vizury in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by Vizury indefinitely; and maintained and archived in our secured servers. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information.
