						Privacy Policy
					</h1>
					
					<!-- Summary -->
					<p>
						<strong>We take user privacy extremely seriously. </strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Where necessary, a detailed privacy policy for your country is available below if you wish to review the complete legalese. This is such an important topic
						however that we have put together below a set of summary questions and answers that we frequently hear and respond to ourselves. We hope that after reading
						these questions you will clearly understand what we do and the value that we provide to the Internet ecosystem.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>What does Vizu do?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We provide research services to advertisers and marketers so that they understand how well (or not) their online advertising campaigns are working. Our
						information is used for understanding advertising performance only, and is not used to target ads to consumers.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may have reached this page by clicking on a privacy policy link from one of our surveys running across the Internet. This survey unit is how we collect
						our data, by surveying actual users on the Internet as they are being exposed to online advertising.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>What information about me does Vizu collect?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						As you surf websites on the Internet, you are exposed to advertising that is the primary source of revenue for those sites. We provide a technology that is
						used with these ads to understand if they are affecting opinions. When you are exposed to one of these ads Vizu collects some anonymous information related
						to your exposure history (e.g., how many individual ads in each campaign you were exposed to, how many times you saw each one, which site you were on when
						you saw each advertisement, and your survey response if you answered). This data is used to measure the impact the campaign is having on users.
					</p>
					<p>
						The information that we collect is strictly limited to the ad campaign data described above. We never know who you are and we would not have the ability to
						identify you or tie any survey response back to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>How will the information Vizu collects about me be used?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Vizu provides aggregated report data about various audiences that were exposed to advertising campaigns. This information is provided to the advertisers
						and marketers responsible for those campaigns, and aids them in improving their advertising efforts in the future. These advertisers spend money on the
						websites and applications that you view freely across the Internet, and Vizu is a critical part of enabling and improving this ecosystem.
					</p>
					<p>
						Vizu does not provide user level data to enable ad retargeting or other purposes related to identifying a specific person. And it is important to remember
						that Vizu never knows who you are; all data collection is completely anonymous and cannot be tied back to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Why is this important? Why should I be ok with Vizu tracking me?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The vast majority of the sites and applications on the Internet are free for users, and are able to survive as businesses because of the revenue they
						generate from advertising campaigns that run on their properties. Advertising essentially pays for much of the content and functionality on the Internet
						that you use every day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Vizu plays an important role in this ecosystem by providing a safe and anonymous measurement system so that advertisers know exactly what is and is not
						effective about their ad campaigns. This keeps advertising revenue flowing to the media properties you frequent, and keeps your viewing experience largely
						free of charge. We have strived to provide a meaningful service for advertisers with valuable data they can use, and that also respects your user privacy.
						If you encounter Vizu's technology you should be aware that our advertising customers will never know any information about you specifically that they
						could use to contact you in the future, and Vizu will not use your responses to retarget advertising to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Can I opt out of Vizu collecting any information about me?</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes, by clicking the button below. This will download an "opt-out" cookie onto your computer which will prevent any future data collection by Vizu. As long
						as this opt-out cookie remains on your computer Vizu will not collect any data about you.

						<p>
							Vizu Corporation ("Vizu," "we," or "us"), located at 185 Berry Street Suite 5200, San Francisco, California 94107, USA, is a member of the Nielsen family
							of companies ("Nielsen"). We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our users and we have created this Privacy Policy to explain our
							privacy practices so you will understand when and how information is collected, used, disclosed and protected through our Ad Catalyst service located at
							the primary domain of Vizu.com (the "Site"). By accessing our Site or services, or responding to any survey through the services, you agree to the terms
							and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What does Vizu do?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu provides a survey research and measurement service that monitors the performance of brand advertising campaigns on the Internet to help advertisers
							and marketers understand how effectively their online advertising campaigns perform.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How Vizu Uses Cookies</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							We use cookies at the Site, <a href="http://www.vizu.com/">www.vizu.com</a>, and in our Ad Catalyst measurement service. Cookies are small text files that
							are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, or to provide
							information to the owners of the site as well as doing web analytics, which means statistical market research services.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>At Vizu.com</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							We use two kinds of cookies at our Site. The Google Analytics cookie collects information about how visitors use our Site, which we use to help improve it.
							Among other things, the cookies collect information about the number of visitors to the Site, where visitors have come to the Site from and the pages they
							visit while they are here. The Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser; this type of cookie is known as a
							"persistent" cookie. We use another persistent cookie when Vizu clients log in to the Ad Catalyst dashboard through the Site. This cookie keeps track of
							when Vizu clients log into the dashboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>In Ad Catalyst</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							Ad Catalyst is a web analytics service that uses a cookie with a unique identifier to record whether an advertisement was displayed to a particular browser
							and whether a person using that browser answered a survey about that particular advertising campaign. The information collected using these cookies is
							limited to a list of the advertising creative units in the campaigns that were displayed to the computer, the sites on which the advertisements appeared,
							along with the number of times each unit was shown and the day/time of each exposure.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of
							cookies. Some features of the service, including opting out, may not work properly if you decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please
						visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. For more information about how to opt-out of our services, see the	section entitled "
							<a href="#Opt_Out_Section">Opting Out</a>" below. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit	<a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How Vizu's survey research and measurement service works</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Advertisers include a Vizu tag with their ads and then place the ads on select sites around the web. The information collected includes the number of
							impressions each ad receives, how many individual ads in each campaign each viewer was exposed to, how many times a viewer saw each ad, and which site the
							viewer was on when the viewer saw the ad. No personal data are collected from viewers of advertisements and the IP address of a viewer's computer, mobile
							or other device is not collected, recorded or stored.
						</p>
						<p>
							The service also presents a single survey question randomly to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. This question is a multiple choice
							question with a predetermined set of answer choices related to the primary marketing objective of the ad campaign. Responses are voluntary. If the viewer
							responds to a survey question, the response is stored in a database. The surveys do not ask for or collect any personal data; all survey responses are
							anonymous and are <strong><em>not</em></strong> linked to the Vizu cookie.
						</p>
						<p>
							The anonymous information is aggregated, analyzed and reported to the advertisers and marketers managing the advertising campaigns.
						</p>
						<p>
							By responding to a survey, you consent to the collection and use of the information as described in this policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What information do we collect? </strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>The Vizu service does not collect, record or store personally identifiable information and does not collect or store IP Addresses.</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							"Personally identifiable information" is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mobile phone number or email address. The
							Vizu service does not collect any personally identifiable information of viewers and survey respondents.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your "IP address" is a number that is automatically assigned by your Internet service provider (ISP) to the computer, mobile or other device that you use
							when you access the Internet. The Vizu service does not collect or store the IP address of your computer, mobile or other device.
						</p>
						<p>
							"Non-personally identifiable information" is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as browser information, behavioral data
							collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies, demographic information, and aggregated information.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Customers</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							For Vizu customers who are using the service to measure their advertising efforts, registration is required to enable access to some features,
							functionality, and information on the Site, to send them specific information related to their service, to allow them to access stored information, and to
							facilitate communication from Vizu. When registering on Vizu, customers may need to provide their full name and email address. Customers must also select a
							username and password for their account.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Viewers</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu records how many times a Vizu-tagged advertisement was displayed to a browser that has a Vizu cookie ("viewer"), how many different ads in a
							particular campaign were displayed to a viewer, and on which websites the advertisements were seen. This information is used to understand what impact the
							campaign is having on users.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Survey Respondents</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							As mentioned before, the Vizu service presents a single survey question to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. Responses are entirely
							voluntary.
						</p>

							Vizu Corporation ("Vizu," "we," or "us"), located at 185 Berry Street Suite 5200, San Francisco, California 94107, USA, is a member of the Nielsen family
							of companies ("Nielsen"). We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy rights of our users and we have created this Cookie and Privacy Policy to
							explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how information is collected, used, disclosed and protected through our Ad Catalyst service
							and the Vizu.com website (the "Site"). By accessing our Site or services, or responding to any survey through the services, you agree to the terms and
							conditions of this Cookie and Privacy Policy.

							We use cookies at the Site, <a href="http://www.vizu.com/">www.vizu.com</a>, and in our Ad Catalyst measurement service. Cookies are small text files that

							<u>At Vizu.com</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							We use two kinds of cookies at our Site. The Google Analytics cookie collects information about how visitors use our Site, which we use to help improve it.
							Among other things, the cookies collect information about the number of visitors to the Site, where visitors have come to the Site from and the pages they
							visit while they are here. The Google Analytics cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser; this type of cookie is known as a
							"persistent" cookie. We use another persistent cookie when Vizu clients log in to the Ad Catalyst dashboard through the Site. This cookie keeps track of
							when Vizu clients log into the dashboard.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>In Ad Catalyst</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							Ad Catalyst is a web analytics service that uses a persistent cookie with a unique identifier to record whether an advertisement was displayed to a
							particular browser and whether a person using that browser answered a survey about that particular advertising campaign. The data collected using these
							cookies is limited to a list of the advertising creative units in the campaigns displayed to the computer containing the Vizu cookie, the sites on which
							the advertisements appeared, along with the number of times each unit was shown and the day/time of each exposure.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of
							cookies. Some features of the service, including opting out, may not work properly if you decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please
						visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. For more information about how to opt-out of our services, see the	<a name="Opt_Out_Section">section entitled "</a><a href="#Opt_Out_Section">Opting Out</a>" below.

						<p>
							<strong>How Vizu's survey research and measurement service works</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong> </strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Advertisers include a Vizu tag with their ads and then place the ads on select sites around the web. The information collected includes the number of
							impressions each ad receives, how many individual ads in each campaign each viewer was exposed to, how many times a viewer saw each ad, and which site the
							viewer was on when the viewer saw the ad. No personal data are collected from viewers of advertisements and the IP address of a viewer's computer, mobile
							or other device is not collected, recorded or stored.
						</p>
						<p>
							The service also presents a single survey question randomly to a small subset of the viewers of an advertising campaign. This question is a multiple choice
							question with a predetermined set of answer choices related to the primary marketing objective of the ad campaign. Responses are voluntary. If the viewer
							responds to a survey question, the response is stored in a database. The surveys do not ask for or collect any personal data; all survey responses are
							anonymous and are <strong><em>not</em></strong> linked to the Vizu cookie.
						</p>
						<p>
							The anonymous information is aggregated, analyzed and reported to the advertisers and marketers managing the advertising campaigns.
						</p>
						<p>
							By responding to a survey, you consent to the collection and use of the information as described in this policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What information do we collect? </strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>The Vizu service does not collect, or record or store personal data like name or email address and does not collect or store IP Addresses.</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Customers</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							For Vizu customers who are using the service to measure the effectiveness of their advertising efforts, registration is required to enable access to some
							features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send customers specific information related to their service, to allow them to access stored
							information, and to facilitate communication from Vizu. When registering on Vizu, customers may need to provide their full name and email address.
							Customers must also select a username and password for their account.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Viewers</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu records how many times a Vizu-tagged advertisement was displayed to a browser with a Vizu cookie ("viewer"), how many different ads in a particular
							campaign were displayed to a viewer, and on which websites the advertisements were seen.
						</p>
						<p>
							<u>From Survey Respondents</u>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu records whether a survey relating to a Vizu-tagged advertising campaign was presented to particular browser with a Vizu cookie and whether the viewer
							answered the survey question. Vizu also records the respondent's answer to the survey question but does <em>not</em> associate the survey answers to the
							Vizu Ad Catalyst cookie.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How do we use this information?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong> </strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu uses the data that it collects to provide its services to its customers and viewers. Vizu aggregates the anonymous data and provides those data to the
							advertisers and marketers responsible for the advertising campaigns. The anonymous data collected by the Vizu service is reported to our customers in an
							aggregated, summarized format, and our customers may use the data to learn how advertising campaigns performed, including which ad units were most
							effective, and how their campaigns can be improved for the future. Vizu may also use the data internally to improve and enhance its services.
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu does not provide user level data to aid in ad retargeting or other purposes related to contacting a specific person.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>With whom do we share information?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu provides the data and reports to its customer advertisers and marketers responsible for the advertising campaigns as described above in the "How do we
							use this information?" section.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the event of a change in ownership, merger or acquisition with another entity, sale or transfer of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency,
							bankruptcy or receivership, we reserve the right to transfer all of Vizu's information, including personal data of its customers, to third parties as part
							of our business assets.
						</p>
						<p>
							Vizu may disclose collected information pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, where required by law, or, at our sole
							discretion, where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the public, preserve our legal rights, take action regarding potentially
							illegal activities, or to prevent the violation of our Terms of Service Agreement or of the rights of Vizu or any third party.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>How do we protect your information?</strong>

							employees and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information, all of whom are bound by this Cookie and Privacy Policy.
							Access or use of information for any purpose other than those explained in this Cookie and Privacy Policy will not be authorized.
						</p>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We strongly recommend that you regularly employ a secure browser
							- one that supports secure transmission of data across the Internet. For more information, consult your browser's help feature. If you have reason to
							believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been
							compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as set forth below.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note, if you are a customer and do not logout once registered for services that require registration, your information could be viewed by other
							users with access to your computer. Your Vizu password is protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account.
							We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Vizu will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately,
							you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Opting Out</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Viewers of ad campaigns are free to opt-out of measurement by the Vizu service at any time. An opt-out button to accomplish this is provided at the bottom
							of this page. This will download an "opt-out" or "do-not-track" cookie onto your machine and you will no longer be tracked or surveyed about ad campaigns
							that you may view. As long as this opt-out cookie remains on your computer, Vizu will not collect any data about you. You must keep this do-not-track
							cookie on your computer and not remove it in order to remain opt-ed out of the collection of information through the Vizu service. If your machine
							automatically removes cookies or you remove the opt-out cookie periodically, you will have to opt out again.

							Vizu reserves the right to update and change this Cookie and Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to our Cookie and Privacy Policy, we will post
							a new statement on our Site and update the "Last Updated" date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check this Cookie and Privacy Policy

							Policy.
