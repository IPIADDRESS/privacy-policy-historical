		<p> VIZ Media, LLC (“VIZ Media”) is committed to providing a fun,
		  safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding
		  all personally identifiable information collected online in accordance with
		  this Policy and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over
		  personally identifiable information while exploring the Internet. Because
		  many visitors to this site are children, we take care that children access
		  only the content that is appropriate for them. In addition, we employ special
		  measures to help children protect their privacy while online. Our practices
		  with respect to the personally identifiable information of children are explained
		  in Section VI below.&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide
		  this summary of the information practices of VIZ Media. This privacy notice
		  governs the collection and use of information at all web sites owned and
		  controlled by VIZ Media including, without limitation:</p>

		<p> (collectively the “Sites”).&nbsp; As we continue to offer our
		  visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our
		  practices from time to time. </p><br>
		
		<p class="sectionhd"><b>I. The Information We Collect</b>
		</p><p>At Our Sites, we do not collect personally identifiable information unless
		  our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. For some activities, such as completing
		  online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information such
		  as first and/or last name, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a
		  favorite title or character.&nbsp; For some other activities, such as entering
		  sweepstakes or contests, participating in forums, sign-ups, chats or bulletin
		  boards or subscribing to our magazines, web sites or e-mail newsletters or
		  requesting us to make products, services or information available to you,
		  we may ask visitors to provide a first and/or last name and e-mail address.
		  For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard, e-mail to a
		  friend, or refer a friend, we may also ask for personally identifiable information
		  about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address.
		  E-mail addresses collected to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a
		  friend are used only for the purpose of transmitting the requested postcard
		  or e-mail.&nbsp; For some limited activities, campaigns, or offers, intended
		  for parents and adults, we may ask a parent or adult to provide their name,
		  address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information,
		  cable or satellite provider, and/or information about their interests in
		  and use of various products, programs, and services.</p>
		<p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from one of our store
		  websites (e.g., store.viz.com, narutostore.viz.com)
		  will be directed prior to purchase to the web site of our outside e-commerce
		  partner, where they will be required to provide their full name, billing
		  and mailing addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and a credit card
		  number. If the order is being shipped to a third party, we will also need
		  the recipient's name and mailing address may be collected by us and/or our
		  third party e-commerce partner.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>On occasion, we might
		  solicit additional voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping
		  preferences.&nbsp; (Please see discussion below about Third party sites).</p>
		<p>For specific one-time requests we receive from visitors, e-mail addresses
		  are collected and used only in connection with the specific one-time request.&nbsp; For
		  example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail addresses are collected for
		  the purpose of entering online sweepstakes or contests and are used to notify
		  winners of the sweepstakes or contest by e-mail. In addition, a contest or
		  sweepstakes participant or visitor to Our Sites may be asked to provide personally
		  identifiable information in connection with any subscriptions, sign-ups or
		  items purchased through Our Sites.&nbsp; Sweepstakes or contest winners may
		  be required to return completed prize Affidavit of Eligibility,&nbsp; Liability
		  Release and/or similar forms by facsimile or U.S. mail within a designated
		  time period (along with the signature of a parent or legal guardian for all
		  minors).</p>
		<p>When visitors come to our Sites, we automatically collect some non-personally
		  identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g.,
		  Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being
		  used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America
		  Online, Earthlink).</p><br>
		<p class="sectionhd"><b>II. How We Use the Information</b>
		</p><p>We generally use visitors' personally identifiable information for the purposes
		  for which it was provided, such as enabling visitors to enter our online
		  contests or sweepstakes or to subscribe to an online newsletter or to order
		  from our e-commerce sites. VIZ Media may also use personally identifiable
		  information provided by vistors at our sites or by shoppers at or through
		  related e-commerce sites to send them, by e-mail or direct mail, notification
		  of special offers, sale events, or birthday reminders. We may disclose personally
		  identifiable information of parents or adults to selected third-party companies
		  that want to contact you in connection with other initiatives or marketing
		  products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. This policy
		  does not cover the privacy practices of these companies or other third parties.</p><br>
		<p><strong><a name="california"></a>California Customers</strong>:<br>
		Individual California residents may specifically request information about
		  our disclosures, if any, of certain categories of personally identifiable
		  information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; Such
		  requests must be submitted to us either by email at the email address or
		  mailing address set forth above.&nbsp; Within thirty (30) days of receiving
		  such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personally identifiable
		  information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes
		  during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and
		  addresses of these third parties.&nbsp; This request may be made no more
		  than once per calendar year.&nbsp; We reserve our right not to respond to
		  requests submitted other than to the email or mailing addresses specified
		  above.</p>
		<p>When visitors submit personally-identifiable information about other individuals
		  through our Site, we use that information [only] for the purpose for which
		  it was provided, such as sending them electronic postcards or e-mail or shipping
		  gifts purchased on or through our e-commerce sites.</p>
		<p>Other than such information relating to the Winners, we do not keep any
		  personally identifiable information we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes
		  after we have successfully selected a winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and
		  administered the contest or sweepstakes. We only use the e-mail addresses
		  of subscribers to e-mail newsletters to send them the requested newsletter(s).
		  Each newsletter also includes instructions for subscription removal via return
		  e-mail.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, we use agents, licensees or contractors to provide services to
		  our visitors, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to
		  winners, shipping or handling customer orders made on or through our e-commerce
		  sites. In these cases, we require the agent, licensee or contractor to keep
		  the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services
		  they are performing. We sometimes use non-personally identifiable information
		  that we collect to improve the design and content of Our Sites, and to improve
		  our visitors' experience on Our Sites. We also may aggregate this information
		  for marketing analysis, surveys, service evaluation, planning and/or to analyze
		  site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
		  the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments,
		  and where we advise users or the possibility of such disclosure at the time
		  they take the survey, we reserve the right to disclose text information provided
		  by any user through such survey, provided that no personally identifiable
		  information for that user is disclosed.<strong></strong></p>
		<p>We may also disclose personally identifiable information in response to
		  legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We
		  also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's
		  request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
		  take action regarding illegal or unauthorized activities, suspected fraud,
		  situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
		  violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the
		  policies governing Our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required
		  or permitted by law. In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable
		  information about you if we or one of our business units acquire, or are
		  acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.&nbsp; For example,
		  we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such
		  as your purchase of a product or service offered on Our Sites), or to enforce
		  our Terms of Use, to send you administrative communications either about
		  your purchases, subscriptions and/or account(s) with us or about features
		  of Our Sites, including, without limitation, any future changes to this Privacy
		  Policy.</p>
		<p>We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information about children
		  under 13 in ways that are materially different from the ones described above
		  without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining
		  consent for any materially different uses.</p><br>
		<p class="sectionhd"><b>III. Cookies, Web Beacons and Opt-Outs</b>
		</p><p>Our Sites use a software technology called cookies. Cookies are small text
		  files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences.
		  Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information.
		  Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this web site
		  to personally identifiable information that the visitor has provided, such
		  as an e-mail address, we do not use cookies for this purpose with one exception:
		  for some activities, we use session cookies to ensure that visitors under
		  the age of 13 provide a parental email address to assist with our compliance
		  with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do use cookies
		  to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections
		  of Our Sites.</p>
		<p>Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to track or monitor
		  the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For
		  example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page
		  or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We
		  may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
		<p>Users may receive site notifications, newsletters or other information via
		  email.&nbsp; Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion.&nbsp; Any
		  email sent to an opt-out list will include directions for how a user may
		  remove him or herself from the list or a URL where the user may find such
		  directions.</p>
		<p>In some cases, users may have the opportunity to use Our Sites to send electronic
		  mail to another user or email list.&nbsp; In such cases, a user’s valid
		  email address and real name will be included with such messages.&nbsp; In
		  order to prevent abuse, users may opt-out of such a display, but may choose
		  to refrain from using said Service to transmit an email message.</p>
		<p>In cases where users voluntarily and publicly disclose personally identifiable
		  information on Our Sites, such personally identifiable information will be

		  THESE SITES ARE NOT COVERED BY OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND MAY FOLLOW DIFFERENT
		  PROCEDURES.</strong></p>
		<p>Additionally, we and Third Party Sites may use third parties to serve or
		  to present the ads that appear on our site and to conduct research about

		</p><p>We have put in place reasonably appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
		  procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access,
		  maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>
		<p>We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the
		  use of credit cards to purchase products over the Internet. For orders placed
		  on or through our e-commerce sites, a technology is used that automatically
		  encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the
		  Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket
		  Layer protocol (SSL).</p>
		<p>To verify the security of your connection, check the outside corners of
		  your browser window or the page where personally identifiable information
		  is provided for e-commerce (such as the check-out or shopping cart pages).
		  If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server
		  is secured by SSL. You may also check by looking at the URL line of your
		  browser. </p><br>
