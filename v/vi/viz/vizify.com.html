<p>Vizify Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Last Updated: July 11, 2012</p>
<p>Scope of the Privacy Policy</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by SteamFunk Labs Inc. (doing business, and hereinafter referred to, as "Vizify").  This policy applies to information we collect when you access or use the Vizify website ("Site") or otherwise interact with Vizify. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies not owned or controlled by Vizify or to people whom Vizify does not employ or manage.</p>
<p>Collection of Information</p>
<p>Vizify may collect information about you in various ways.</p>
<p>First, we collect information you provide to us, such as when you create a Vizify account, use Vizify's services, subscribe to a Vizify newsletter or sign up to participate in a promotion, sweepstakes or survey offered by Vizify.  The types of information we may collect include your email address, password, and any other contact, historical, demographic or other information you choose to provide.</p>
<p>Second, we may automatically collect certain information about you when you use the Site, including as follows:</p>
<p>Log Information.  We log information about how you use our Site, including your access times, browser types and language, internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, number of clicks and Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses.</p>
<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Web Beacons.  We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device and using web beacons.  Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in device memory by a website.  Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Site or emails.  Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can usually change your browser settings to remove and/or reject cookies.  If you set your browser to remove or reject cookies, however, please note that our Site may not function properly.</p>
<p>Finally, we may also collect information about you from third parties and combine that with information we collect through our Site.  For example, when you authorize Vizify to connect to certain third-party social networking sites, we will access information about you from those sites, including but not limited to your name, email address, photos, account information, friends lists, check-in histories, and other information you make available through status updates, tweets, stories, posts, or otherwise.  We collect this information in accordance with the privacy policies and authorization procedures determined by third-party social networking sites in addition to the privacy settings you establish with these sites.  For more information, please refer directly to the privacy policies of the relevant third-party social networking sites.</p>

<p>With other Vizify users or the general public in accordance with the privacy settings you establish through our Site (please see "Your Information Choices" below for information on how to manage your sharing preferences);</p>
<p>
When required by law, or if we have good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with current judicial proceedings, a court order or legal process served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, property and interests, including by enforcing our agreements, policies and
<a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>,
