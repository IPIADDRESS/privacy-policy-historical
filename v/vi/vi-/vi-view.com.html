    <h3 class="title">Privacy Policy</h3>
    <div class="section">
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and the security of information you provide to us. Vi-view Systems International Inc. ("Vi-view") will not sell, rent, lease or disclose customer information to third parties unless required by law or unless you provide consent to such a disclosure. Other terms of Vi-view's privacy policy are as follows:
    </div>
    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
    <div class="section">
        When you engage in activities on our websites or within our products, like ordering or registering products, downloading trial versions of software or software updates, requesting technical support, or subscribing to newsletters and e-mail publications, Vi-view may ask you to provide us with information. By choosing to enter and submit the requested information when prompted, you are consenting to Vi-view's collection, use, and disclosure of such information for the purposes of providing the services to you as outlined herein. Any information you post to a chat room or public bulletin is available to all users of that site.
    </div>
    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <div class="section">
        Any information collected will be used only by Vi-view to improve our products, services and websites, or to communicate with you by phone, e-mail, newsletter, and/or notices. Vi-view uses information and/or e-mail addresses for internal purposes only and does not sell, lease or rent information to third parties.
    </div>
    <h3>Trial Software Activation</h3>
    <div class="section">
        A valid e-mail address is required to receive trial unlock codes for many of our products. If you enter into a trial period of Vi-view software, and consent to our use of your e-mail address by providing the same, we may contact you via phone or e-mail to provide additional information on our products and to survey you on your satisfaction with our software. We may also contact you to provide advance notice of termination of the trial period or an opportunity to extend your trial period. E-mail is our preferred method of communication and we value the privilege to use it.
    </div>
    <h3>Product Purchasing</h3>
    <div class="section">
        Information we ask you to provide when purchasing or ordering will be only the information necessary to process your purchase or order. When fulfilling an order we will ask for your name, e-mail address, address (for shipping purposes), telephone number and credit card number, type and expiration date (if paying by credit card). We will use this information only for matters related to your order or product registration unless you request otherwise. Your credit card information will be maintained only for a period reasonably necessary to ensure payment has been received.
    </div>
    <h3>Product Registration</h3>
    <div class="section">
        If, after or during purchase, you choose to register your Vi-view software, any information you provide will only be used to improve the service provided to you as a result of your registration. The details of information we gather will be used to uniquely identify your relationship to an Vi-view software application and potentially to support communication with you including: notification of software updates and service releases, notice of changes in policy that relate to the use of your software, and the provision to you of prioritized customer service or technical support.
    </div>
    <h3>Vi-view Newsletter and Information List Memberships</h3>
    <div class="section">
        When you consent to receive newsletters, Vi-view may use information it has collected to provide you with mailed or e-mailed notices according to the preferences that you indicate to us. This may include notice in the form of newsletters, website update notices, notification of the availability of new products or product updates as well as information on promotions and special offers. You can elect to not receive any further notices from Vi-view, either by 1) unsubscribing directly to any e-mail you receive, or 2) by logging into your account with Vi-view where you can unsubscribe or change your preferences. (You can log-in to the preference center once you have submitted your e-mail address to Vi-view and it has been processed.)
    </div>
    <h3>Vi-view Website or Vi-view Product User Surveys</h3>
    <div class="section">
        The purpose of this information request will be optional and required only to engage in certain activities. Additional information we may ask you to provide when choosing to engage in other activities on our websites or within our products may include name, mailing address, telephone number, facsimile numbers, e-mail address, and other demographic information that will enable us to better understand the requirements of our customers and to continue to provide high quality products and services.
    </div>
    <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
    <div class="section">
        Vi-view takes the protection of the personal information you provide very seriously. Personal information collected is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. When passing information over the Internet through the Vi-viewInTouch or Vi-viewID service, information is protected through the use of encryption, specifically through the use of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. However, perfect security on the Internet does not yet exist and we cannot warrant that our transfer of data is impenetrable or invulnerable to hackers. Internal data is shared through secured transmissions and maintained in secured databases.
        <br><br>
        Vi-view may hire certain outside contractors to perform services or functions on our behalf (such as customer support, packaging &amp;mbsp; shipping). We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to complete the desired service. They are not permitted to use customer information for any other purpose and are obligated to keep your customer information confidential. Information submitted to Vi-view may be transferred across national boundaries to or from our staff in other countries. Vi-view will only disclose customer information if required to do so by law, legal process or if in good faith it is deemed necessary for the public interest.
    </div>
