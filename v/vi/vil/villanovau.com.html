<h1>Privacy Policy<span>&nbsp;4/7/2009</span></h1>

<h2>Your privacy</h2>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. You have chosen to do business with us, and we recognize our obligation to keep the information you provide secure and to inform you of our policies concerning its use. You can be sure that our commitment to protect your information will continue under the principles and online guidelines described below.</p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with any Bisk Education website, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a></p>
<!-- End Your Privacy -->

<!-- What Info...? -->
<h3>What information do we collect and when do we collect it?</h3>

<p>As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to our website. We may use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our website, how visitors navigate throughout the website and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information may be used to improve our website or to share with business partners. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not contain any personal information. We track this activity using a service provided by Omniture. You should refer to Omniture’s privacy policy to learn specifically how they collect and use information. You can find Omniture’s privacy policy at: <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product" target="_blank">www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product</a></p>

<p>Also, in certain areas of our website — such as when you place an order, request more information, download demo products, fill out a survey or enter a contest — you are required to enter personal contact information (name, mailing address, email address, phone number) that allows us to contact you (if necessary) and also financial information (credit card information) that allows us to process your order. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still browse most of our website (the areas that do not require registration) anonymously.</p>

<!-- Why? -->
<h3>Why do we collect the information?</h3>

<p>We collect information to process and fulfill your order, to notify you of your order status, to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and new services, and to help us understand our customers in order to create content and a web environment that is most relevant to you.</p>
<!-- End Why? -->

<!-- What about Cookies...? -->
<h3>What about “cookies”?</h3>

<p>To provide better service and a more effective website, we sometimes use “cookies” as part of our interaction with your browser. A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard drive by our web page server. “Cookies” are commonly used on websites and do not harm your system. By configuring your preferences or options in your browser, you determine if and how a “cookie” will be accepted. We use “cookies” to determine if you have previously visited our website and for a number of administrative purposes. These “cookies” do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through “cookies” with other personal information to determine who you are or your email address.</p>

<p>We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, go to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a></p>

<!-- Protect Customer Info...? -->
<h3>How does Bisk Education protect customer information?</h3>

<p>We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data to help ensure its security. Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.</p>

<p>Financial transactions are carried out using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that encrypts the data you provide to ensure privacy. We will notify you when you are using a page that is protected with SSL technology.</p> 
<!-- End Protect Customer Info...? -->

<!-- Disclosure...? -->
<h3>Will Bisk Education disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</h3>

<p>The contact information we collect is used to improve the content of our website and to contact customers for marketing purposes. For example, based on the information you provide we may decide to inform you of existing Bisk products and services, including any of the programs that participate in the University Alliance Online, that we feel may be of interest to you. We may also use the collected information to help develop new products and services that we think customers may find helpful in the future. With the goal of bringing you greater convenience and more choices, we make portions of your contact information (never financial information) available to affiliated companies that offer products and services that you also may enjoy and/or benefit from using. We share information only for legitimate business purposes. In each case, we carefully review the company and the products and services offered to make sure that they provide value. If you do not wish to receive any or all such offers, please let us know by emailing us at any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a>. If you don’t want to receive printed materials, please also provide us with your exact name and address and we will be sure your name is removed from the data we share with our business partners.</p>

<p>In order to comply with the Federal anti-spam laws effective January 1, 2004, we now provide a suppression list of the e-mail addresses of those who ask to be removed from our distribution database to third party advertisers who provide e-mail marketing services to our company. We require all third party marketers to sign an agreement prohibiting them from using this data for any purpose other than sending out our marketing materials.</p>
<!-- End Disclosure...? -->

<!-- Info Up-to-Date -->
<h3>Keeping customer information up-to-date</h3>

<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important. If you ever find that our records are incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please email at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a> and we will correct the information as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- End Info Up-to-Date -->

<!-- Opt Out -->
<h3>Opt Out</h3>

<p>We honor all requests to be removed from our e-mailing lists within ten days, and update our suppression list every ten days. If you prefer to learn about new offers from Bisk through a specific medium — for example, through the mail — simply let us know your preference by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a>. If you do not want to receive messages from Bisk, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a> and we will remove your name from our in-house list and add you to our marketing suppression list. Our physical address is:</p>

<address>Bisk Education, Inc.<br>
Attn: Internet List Services<br>
9417 Princess Palm Avenue<br>
Tampa, Florida, 33619</address>

<p>We are fully committed to complying with your wishes regarding receiving commercial e-mail messages from us and with the laws regarding unsolicited e-mail. If for any reason you receive a commercial message directly from us or on our behalf more than ten days after making a request to be taken off our mailing list, we would request that you forward a copy of the e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a> with a brief explanation of your efforts to unsubscribe and the approximate timeframe you made the request. We will immediately investigate the matter, confirm that you have been removed, and provide a written response to you detailing our efforts.</p>
