            Application Privacy Statement</p>
        <p>
            This privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) applies to the treatment of personally
            identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from, you in connection
            with the associated application (“Application”). The Application is provided by

            licensor or partner (“Application Partner”). By using or otherwise accessing the
            Application, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined
            in this Privacy Statement.</p>
        <p>
            WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES Village.Photos COLLECT?</p>
        <p>
            We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
        <p>
            Personal Information You Provide to Us: We may receive and store any information
            you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain – such as, from
            (for example) your Facebook account). The types of personal information collected
            may include your full name, email address,IP address, browser information, username,
            demographic information, and any other information necessary for us to provide the
            Application services.</p>
        <p>
            Personal Information Collected Automatically: We receive and store certain types
            of usage related information whenever you interact with Application. For example,
            Village.Photos may automatically receive and record information regarding your computer’s
            IP address, browser information, Facebook user ID, Facebook Page fan status, and
            URLs accessed. Such information may be shared in aggregate (non-personally identifiable)
            form with our partners.</p>
        <p>
            HOW DOES Village.Photos USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?</p>
        <p>
            Village.Photos uses the information described in this Privacy Statement (i) internally,
            to analyze, develop and improve its products and services, and (ii) as set forth
            below in the “Will Village.Photos Share any of the personal information it Collects”
            section below.</p>
        <p>
            APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p>
        <p>
            Village.Photos may provide personal information to the applicable Application Partner.
            The Application Partner’s use of your personal information is subject to the Application
            Partner’s separate privacy policy – and not this Privacy Statement. The Application
            Partner’s privacy policy is linked to from within the Partner’s Facebook application.</p>
        <p>
            Village.Photos SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES? Personal information
            about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your
            personal information to anyone (with the exception of sharing your information with
            an applicable Application Partner – see the “Application Partner Treatment” section
            above). We share your personal information only as described below.</p>
        <p>
            Application Partners: We will share your personal information with an applicable
            Application Partner (see the “Application Partner Treatment” section above).</p>
        <p>
            Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and
            need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.
            Unless we tell you differently, Village.Photos’s agents do not have any right to
            use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
            You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the above purposes.
            Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
            types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets
            that are transferred. Moreover, if Village.Photos, or substantially all of its assets
            were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Village.Photos goes out of business
            or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred
            or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and
            that any acquirer of Village.Photos may continue to use your personal information
            as set forth in this policy.</p>
        <p>
            Protection of Village.Photos and Others: We may release personal information when
            we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce
            or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,
            or safety of Village.Photos, our employees, our users, or others. This includes
            exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
            and credit risk reduction.</p>
        <p>
            With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal
            information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing
            of this information.</p>
        <p>
            CONDITIONS OF USE.</p>
        <p>
