<h2 class="terms"><span>4</span> TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES/COOKIES</h2>
<br><br>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. However, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.<br><br>
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use these cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.<br><br>
<b>Web Beacons/Gifs:</b> Some of our third party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs or pixels (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>Analytics/Log Files</b>: As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>3rd Party Tracking:</b>: The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media) on the site is not covered by our privacy policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting:</b> We partner with a third party ad network to both display advertising on our Web site and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests and track which ads you click on. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.<br><br>
We use Adhitz Ads to publish ads on this site. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites. You may opt-out of the use of this cookie by visiting Adhitz’s Privacy page: <a href="http://www.adhitz.com/en/Privacy_Policy" target="_blank">http://www.adhitz.com/en/Privacy_Policy</a><br><br>
<h2 class="terms"><span>5</span> SECURITY</h2>
<br><br>The security of your personal information is important to us. We encrypt the transmission of all information submitted through our site using secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br><br>
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
