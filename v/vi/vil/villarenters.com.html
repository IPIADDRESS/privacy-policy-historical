            <p>We use the contact details to communicate with the Owner and Renter. </p>
            <p>If you make an order or purchase goods or services through our website, such as a purchase of our Non-Refundable Breakage Waiver, we may disclose to the supplier of the goods or service your personal information to our partners, suppliers and sub-contractors in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, compete billing and invoicing transactions and to enable delivery and logistics to be planned and delivered efficiently. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may supply your personal data to trusted suppliers who undertake analysis for us. </p>
            <p>We may also pass your personal data to other third parties (including, without limitation, our Affiliates) if necessary in order to arrange for a booking to be provided or enquiry answered or to process a booking in a way contemplated by our website. </p>
            <p>In some cases we may pass information, including your personal data, to third parties outside the European Economic Area. These countries may not provide the same level of protection for your personal data as the UK.&nbsp;If we do transfer your data outside the European Economic Area we will put in place a contract to ensure, so far as reasonably possible, that your information is protected or, where applicable, covered by the US “Safe Harbour Program”.</p>
            <p><b>Consents</b></p>
            <p>By entering your personal data onto our website, you agree to your personal data being processed in these ways.&nbsp;If you are a Renter you agree that you are authorised to disclose to us personal data about your Renter’s Party and that we may use such personal data in the same way as if it were your personal data.<br>

                If you have subscribed to our e-mail service or have made a booking for, or an enquiry about, the services we offer, you agree we may send you targeted promotional e-mails about the services and special deals we offer unless you have opted out of receiving these.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You agree that we may also disclose our customer database, including any personal data relating to you contained in it, to a third party who acquires or attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the assets or shares in Clickstay Ltd. or our website whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Updating your personal data</b></p>
            <p>Please ensure that you keep your personal data up to date.</p>

            <p>If you post a comment on our website, or send a comment to us by email, text message or phone, or by letter or other means, we may display this content indefinitely in any relevant context. This will be anonymised in the case of testimonials or customer services conversations.</p>
            <p>When you give information about another person, you confirm that that person has appointed you to act in that way and to consent to the processing of that person’s personal data, in the ways described above as if it were your personal data including, without limitation, to the transfer of that data outside the European Economic Area.</p>
            <p><b>Disclosure</b></p>
            <p>We may disclose your personal data where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so.
