However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li> </ul> <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details in Section 18 below.
