<p><strong>Paysec USA LLC. Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Paysec USA LLC. (“Company” or “we”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this privacy policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the Victoria Milan<sup>®</sup> websites and mobile application, including but not limited to <a href="http://www.victoriamilan.net">www.victoriamilan.net</a> (collectively our “Website” or “Victoria Milan”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to our Privacy Policy, below). Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong><br>
This privacy policy applies to information we collect: on the Website; in e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and the Website; and through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website. This policy does not apply to information collected by:&nbsp; us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by the Company or any third party such as a social media site; or any third party (including our affiliates or subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect and How we Collect It</strong><br>
We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website, including information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address (“personal information”) and other information that is about you but individually does not identify you. We collect this information: directly from you when you provide it to us and; automatically as you navigate through the Website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information you provide to us.</strong> We may collect and store any personal information you enter on the Website. This includes information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We may also collect information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.</p>

<p>The email address you provide during account registration will not be visible or otherwise available to other users. We nonetheless encourage all of our members and users to create an anonymous separate email account. This will help secure your privacy when using this Website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose to upload an image to your profile, there is a risk of being recognized and linked to your real identity. We therefore advise you to use photos that do not show your face fully or to use out unique AnonymousBlur<sup>TM </sup>feature to make your face unrecognizable in the photos you choose to upload. This will maintain your anonymous identity while at the same time allowing users to get an impression of your physical appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you pay via the Website, the Company and sites other than the card processor cannot access your bank account or credit card number. Victoria Milan does not store any credit card sensitive information, and uses Payex which is a leading professional payment service for online transaction. Your Payex account is secured by BBS ePay.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information we collect automatically.</strong> We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Website or application. This information may include your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us and the referring website address. The technologies we use for this automatic information collection may include Cookies (See "Cookies and Usage Reports" below).</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Usage Reports</strong></p>

<p>By placing a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer (or other device), we and our third party service providers passively gather information about your use of the Website for several reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: statistics collection and analysis, Website optimization, analytics (as described below), market research, and maintenance of user login information. The information that we and our third party service providers track with cookies includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser (such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) and Internet-connected device being used to access the Website, your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, your home domain or Internet service provider, your referrer URL (which is the URL for the website that you were viewing prior to visiting the Website), how you were directed to the Website, which specific pages you access on the Website, how long you view each page, the time and date you access our Website and the total number of visitors to the Website and any portions thereof.&nbsp; We use your IP address to determine the general physical location of your computer or device and understand from what geographic locations our Website visitors come.</p>

<p>We, and/or our third party service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your computer for security purposes (such as authentication), to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Website. Cookies allow us and our third party service providers to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Website and pages visited (these types of cookies are typically referred to as “Session Cookies”).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our third party service providers use pixels which cause “cookies” or similar technology to be stored on your browsers when you visit the Website. This is necessary for our third party service providers to provide retargeting services. The collection of this anonymous data allows us to better target our advertising to your interests. The data also helps us and our third party service providers improve our respective product and services.&nbsp; You can opt out of this tracking at any time by following the instructions below in the section called “Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.”</p>

<p>Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities, or cause some features of the Website to function improperly or more slowly. If there are any problems related to “Cookies”, you may be told to change your security settings. Consult your user manual for instructions on adjusting your browser settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Website uses Google Analytics (a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Website and how we can improve the Website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they used prior to coming to such Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Websites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Website to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Website, please review “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps”, (located <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a> or any successor URL). If you would like additional information regarding the security and privacy practices of Google’s Universal Analytics feature, please review the materials provided by Google <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2838718?hl=en">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the areas of the Website may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow the Company and its third party providers or affiliates, to count and track users who have visited certain portions of the Website. Web beacons collect only limited information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.&nbsp; Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (of Flash Cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, and from, our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as used for browser cookies. For more information about managing the privacy and security settings of Flash cookies, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information: Tracking Technologies and Advertising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By using the Service and/or the Website you agree unambiguously to the use of cookies in order to enable us to use, develop and/or improve the Service and the Website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Collection Purposes, Use of Data</strong><br>
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including personal information: to present our Website and its contents to you; to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us; to manage your account and provide you with customer support; to provide you with notices about your account/subscription, including expiration and renewal notices; to carry out obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including billing and collection; to allow you to participate in interactive features on our Website; to perform ad tracking and website or mobile application analytics; in any way we may describe when you provide the information; to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it; for any other purposes with your consent. Victoria Milan will never send out spam or use the database to help others do such activities.&nbsp; You can opt out of receiving marketing emails as explained below (see “Choices About How We Use and Disclose Personal Information”).</p>

<p>We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audience. Even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Disclosures of Personal Information</strong><br>
We do not sell or rent your personal information and we do not share your personal information with others except as otherwise described in this privacy policy.&nbsp; If you do provide us with personal information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected, and we will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so, (2) it is necessary to allow our trusted service providers or agents (who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them) to provide services for us, (3) in order to provide our products or services to you, (4) it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements, (5) it is necessary in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company into another entity or any consolidation, share exchange, combination, reorganization, or like transaction in which Company is not the survivor, or (6) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law.&nbsp; Also, we reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form (including aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual).</p>

<p><strong>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</strong></p>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how to manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website.

If you do not wish to have your e-mail address used by the company to promote our own products or services, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form on which we collect your data (the [order form/registration form]) or at any time by logging onto the Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking relevant boxes or by sending us an e-mail stating your request to support@digipaysec.com. If we have sent you a promotional e-mail, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future e-mail distributions or you may opt-out by clicking the link at the bottom of the email and following the instructions. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request, as some promotions may already be in process. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as a result of a service purchase or other transaction.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

If personal information you have submitted through the Website is no longer accurate, current, or complete, and you wish to update it, please do so by logging onto the Website and updating your account profile.

Upon appropriate request, we will usually be glad to update or amend your information in most circumstances, but we reserve the right to use information obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate and lawful.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Correspondence</strong></p>

<p>If you correspond with the Company through the Website or via email, we may share your messages with those within our organization who are most capable of addressing the issues contained in your message.&nbsp; We will keep a copy of your message until we have had an opportunity to address your concerns.&nbsp; We may archive your message for a certain period of time or discard it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>User Contributions</strong></p>

<p>We provide areas on our site where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs (“User Contributions”). Such postings are governed by our <a href="https://www.victoriamilan.net/info_terms">Terms of Service</a>. You post and transmit your User Contributions to others at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, and you may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to the information you post.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We have implemented measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosures. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information collected via the Website.&nbsp; We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.

<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
For your convenience, we may provide links to other websites and web pages that we do not control (collectively, “Linked Sites”).&nbsp; We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of any websites or pages not under our control and we do not endorse any of these websites or pages, the services or products described or offered on such sites or pages, or any of the content contained on those sites or pages.
