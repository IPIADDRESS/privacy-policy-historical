<p>
	Victoria Teachers Limited (ACN 087 651 769) trading as Victoria Teachers Mutual Bank('we', 'us', 'our') is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles under the <em>Privacy Act </em>1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). We are also bound by Division 3 of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act, which regulates the handling of credit information, credit eligibility information and related information by credit providers; and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code.</p>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy outlines how we deal with your personal information (including credit-related information), as well as our legal obligations and rights as to that information. If we agree with you to use or disclose any of your personal information in ways which differ to those stated in this Privacy Policy, the provisions of that agreement will prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.</p>
<h4>
	Key types of information</h4>
<p>
	Certain words have special meanings when used in this Privacy Policy. These are shown below.</p>
<p>
	'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an individual who is identified, or who can reasonably be identified, from the information. Although we try to make sure that all information we hold is accurate, 'personal information' also includes any inaccurate information about the individual.</p>
<p>
	'Credit eligibility information' means information that has been obtained from a credit reporting body, or that has been derived from that information, that is about an individual's credit worthiness.</p>
<p>
	'Credit information' means personal information that includes the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Information about an individual, like their name and address, that we may use to identify that individual;</li>
	<li>
		Information about an individual's current or terminated consumer credit accounts and, from 12 March 2014, an individual's repayment history;</li>
	<li>
		The type and amount of credit applied for in any previous consumer or commercial credit applications to any credit provider, where that credit provider has requested information;</li>
	<li>
		Information about an individual from a credit reporting body;</li>
	<li>
		Information about consumer credit payments overdue for at least 60 days and for which collection action has started;</li>
	<li>
		Advice that payments that were previously notified to a credit reporting body as overdue are no longer overdue;</li>
	<li>
		Information about new credit arrangements an individual may have made with a credit provider, in relation to consumer credit currently or previously held, to deal with any defaults or serious credit infringements by that individual;</li>
	<li>
		Information about court judgments which relate to credit that an individual has obtained or applied for;</li>
	<li>
		Information about an individual on the National Personal Insolvency Index;</li>
	<li>
		Publicly available information about an individual's credit worthiness; and</li>
	<li>
		An opinion of a credit provider that an individual has committed a serious credit infringement of credit provided by that credit provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We may not hold all of these kinds of information about a particular individual. However, if we hold any of these kinds of information, it is protected as 'credit information' under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	'Credit-related information' means credit information, credit eligibility information and related information.</p>
<h4>
	Collection</h4>
<p>
	Wherever possible, we will collect personal information (including credit information) directly from you. This information will generally come from what you provide in your application for one of our products or services and supporting documentation.</p>
<p>
	We only ask for personal information relevant to our business relationship with a customer. When you apply for one of our products or services, we may request:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Identifying information, like your name, address and other contact details and your date of birth;</li>

	We may also collect personal information (including credit-related information) about you from third parties, such as any referees that you provide, your employer, other credit providers and third party service providers including credit reporting bodies. Credit reporting bodies collect credit information about individuals which they provide as credit reports to credit providers and others in the credit industry to assist them in managing credit risk, collecting debts and other activities. From 12 March 2014, you can also ask a credit reporting body, through contact details on their website, not to use or disclose your personal information if you believe, on reasonable grounds, that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, including identity fraud.</p>
<p>
	Some information is created through our internal processes, like credit eligibility scoring information.</p>

In that case, we will give you written notice that the application has been refused on the basis of that information. We will tell you the name and contact details of the relevant credit reporting body and other relevant information.</p>

</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>
	A 'cookie' is a small text file which is placed on your internet browser and which we may access each time you visit our website. When you visit the secured pages of our website (i.e. pages that you have to provide login details to access) we use cookies for security and personalisation purposes. When you visit the unsecured pages of our website (i.e. public pages that you can access without providing login details) we use cookies to obtain information about how our website is being used.</p>
<p>
	You may change the settings on your browser to reject cookies, however doing so might prevent you from accessing the secured pages of our website.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Email</strong></p>
<p>
	When we receive emails, we will retain the content of the email and our response to you where we consider it necessary to do so.</p>
<p>
	Your email address will only be used or disclosed for the purpose for which is was provided. It will not be added to any mailing lists or used for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>
	We use up-to-date security measures on our website to protect your personal information and your credit information. Any data containing personal, credit or related information which we transmit via the internet is encrypted. However, we cannot guarantee that any information transmitted via the internet by us, or you, is entirely secure. You use our website at your own risk.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Links on our website</strong></p>
<p>
	Our website may contain links to third party websites. The terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to external websites. If you wish to find out how any third parties handle your personal information or credit information, you will need to obtain a copy of their privacy policy.</p>
<h4>
	Access</h4>
<p>
	You may request access to the personal information (including credit-related information) that we hold about you at any time by contacting us.</p>
<p>
	We will respond to your request for access within a reasonable time. If we refuse to give you access to any of your personal information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and the relevant provisions of the Privacy Act that we rely on to refuse access.

<p>
	We may recover the reasonable costs of our response to a request for access to personal information.</p>
<h4>
	Accuracy</h4>
<p>
	We take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information (including credit-related information) that we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

<h4>

<p>
	We may use your personal information, including your contact details, to provide you with information about products and services, including those of third parties, which we consider may be of interest to you. We are permitted to do this while you are our customer, and even if you are on the Do Not Call Register.</p>
<p>
	We may also provide your details to other organisations for specific marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
	We will consider that you consent to this, unless you opt out. You may opt out at any time if you no longer wish to receive marketing information or do not wish to receive marketing information through a particular channel, like email. In order to do so, you will need to request that we no longer send marketing materials to you or disclose your information to other organisations for marketing purposes. You can make this request by contacting us<em>, </em>or by 'unsubscribing' from our email marketing messages, which always include an unsubscribe option.</p>
<p>
	To help us reach the right people with our credit direct marketing, we may ask a credit reporting body to 'pre-screen' a list of potential recipients of our direct marketing against our eligibility criteria to remove recipients that do not meet those criteria. From 12 March 2014, the credit reporting body cannot use information about your existing loans or repayment history in carrying out its pre-screening and it must destroy its pre-screening assessment once it has given us, or a contractor acting on our behalf, the list of eligible recipients. If you do not want your credit information used for pre-screening by a credit reporting body that holds credit information about you, you can opt-out by informing that credit reporting body, whose contact details are on their website.</p>
<h4>
	Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
	We may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time (without notice to you) that are necessary for our business requirements or the law. Our current Privacy Policy is available on our website.</p>
<h4>
	Questions and complaints</h4>
<p>
	If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this Privacy Policy, or our handling of your personal information (including credit-related information), please contact our Privacy Officer whose details are in paragraph 14 of this Privacy Policy<em>. </em>You can also contact the Privacy Officer if you believe that the privacy of your personal information has been compromised or is not adequately protected.</p>
<p>
	Once a complaint has been lodged, the Privacy Officer will respond to you as soon as possible. We will aim to deal with your complaint at the source of your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the response you receive, please let us know and our Complaints Officerwill investigate further and respond to you.</p>
<p>
	If you are still not satisfied, you can contact external bodies that deal with privacy complaints. These are the Financial Ombudsman Scheme,which is our external dispute resolution scheme, the Federal Privacy Commissioner or, in the case of insurance-related privacy complaints, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Any of these bodies may forward your complaint to another external dispute resolution body if it considers the complaint would be better handled by that other body.</p>
