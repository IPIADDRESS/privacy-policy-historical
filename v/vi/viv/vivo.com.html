                RealNetworks offers a variety of "plug-in" products that are compatible with certain RealNetworks products. While we endeavor to fully research and disclose how such plug-ins utilize personal information, RealNetworks is not responsible for the operation of plug-ins provided by third parties and we strongly encourage you to visit their Web sites and read the privacy policies that govern their usage.
